Miocene PCDs are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc , and the giant Miocene PCDs cluster in its eastern segment where no Jurassic PCDs occur .
Miocene ore - forming porphyries have young Hf model ages and Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions overlapping with those of the Jurassic rocks in the eastern segment , whereas contemporaneous barren porphyries outside the Jurassic arc have abundant zircon inheritance and crustlike Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions .
Most porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) form in magmatic arcs worldwide and are associated with hydrous ( > 4 wt % H 2 O ) calc - alkaline magmas , derived from an asthenospheric mantle wedge metasomatized by slab fluids ( Richards , 2003 ) .
Most porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) form in magmatic arcs worldwide and are associated with hydrous calc - alkaline magmas , derived from an asthenospheric mantle wedge metasomatized by slab fluids ( Richards , 2003 ) .
Subduction processes are thought to ultimately cause enrichment of metals ( Cu , Au ) and S ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ) and the relatively high oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and high H 2 O contents in arc magmas ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) that are critical to the formation of PCDs .
Northward subduction of the Neo - Tethyan Ocean beneath the Lhasa terrane formed the Jurassic - Cretaceous volcanoplutonic arcs ( Fig . 1B ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .
Porphyry - type mineralization in the Lhasa terrane is linked to two distinct magmatic suites .
The giant Xiongcun PCD ( 219 . 8 Mt Cu resources averaging 0 . 43 % Cu and 0 . 61 g / t Au ; Tafti et al . , 2009 ) with Re - Os molybedenite age of 173 Â± 5 Ma ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) is associated with a Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry in the WSJA ( Fig . 1B ) .
The Jurassic arc rocks are mainly calc - alkaline , and are characterized by enrichment in large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE ; e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSE ; e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) with flat heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) , thus showing typical subduction - related geochemical features ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1993 ) .
Arc rocks from the WSJA have ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i varying from 0 . 7041 to 0 . 7048 , e Nd ( t ) from + 5 . 5 to + 7 . 5 , and zircon e Hf ( t ) between + 11 and + 18 ( Fig . 2 ) .
The Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are mainly high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) with enrichment in LILE ( e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in HFSE ( e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) , similar to the Jurassic rocks ( Fig . DR1 ) .
The Miocene barren porphyries outside the Jurassic arc have crust - like Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic signatures and abundant zircon inheritance , consistent with a source dominated by old continental crust ( Fig . 2 ) .
The zircon Hf data of the mineralized Miocene porphyries also lie within the evolution trend of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2B ) .
The average zircon e Hf ( t ) values of the Jurassic rocks decrease significantly from the WSJA ( average + 16 ) to the ESJA ( average + 6 ) , suggesting distinct intra - crustal magmatic processes along the arc .
High f O 2 of the arc magma in the WSJA , evidenced by appearance of magmatic anhydrite in the Xiongcun host porphyry ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) , suppressed the formation of significant amounts of Cu - rich sulfides ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) , which led to Cu enrichment in the evolving magma , thus forming the Jurassic PCDs ( Fig . 3 ) .
Hf isotopes might , therefore , be an important tool for assessing the metallogenic fertility of porphyry magmas ( Fig . DR3 ) .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment between subduction - and collision - related magmas may be used to evaluate the mineral potential for such deposits in other orogenic belts .
The India - Asia continental collision zone was built on a complex tectonic collage of terranes accreted onto the southern margin of the Asian continent since the Mesozoic ( Fig . 1A ; Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
The India - Asia collision during the Cenozoic produced a 1500 - km - long trans - Himalayan Miocene igneous belt along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Miller et al . , 1999 ) , and led to crustal thickening ( as much as 80 km ) in south Lhasa ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) .

The Miocene post - collisional magmas occur as isolated stocks of porphyritic monzogranite and minor granodiorite and granite .
The mineralized porphyries developed in the Jurassic arc , whereas contemporaneous barren ones were emplaced outside the arc ( Fig . 1B ) .
The Miocene PCDs show a close spatial relationship with the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , despite being separated by a time interval of ~ 170 - 130 m . y .
This Jurassic arc is divided by a north - south - oriented rift into a western segment ( WSJA ) and an eastern segment ( ESJA ) , which are dominated by diorite intrusions with andesites , and granitic intrusions with basalt and dacite , respectively .
They have Sr - Nd isotopic compositions partly overlapping with those of the Jurassic rocks and plot along a two - component mixing array between Jurassic basalt and old lower crust in Tibet ( Fig . 2A ) .
However , the ESJA barren rocks show Sr - Nd isotopic departure from the depleted mantle toward the crust ( Fig . 2 ) , indicating the involvement of old crustal components ( < 15 vol % ) , consistent with old Hf model ages for these rocks ( ca .
Pronounced crustal thickening at 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) and subsequent slab break - off ( or tearing ) starting at 25 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) triggered this remelting as isotherms rebounded and / or hot asthenospheric melts infiltrated the lithosphere ( Richards , 2009 ) .
The trend to lower e Nd ( t ) shown by some ore - related porphyries could reflect mixing with lesser amounts ( 5 % - 30 % ) of old lower crust ( Fig . 2A ) .

The trend to lower e Nd ( t ) shown by some ore - related porphyries could reflect mixing with lesser amounts ( 5 % - 30 % ) of old lower crust ( Fig . 2A ) .
The lack of Miocene PCDs outside of the Jurassic arc suggests that there are no sulfidebearing Jurassic cumulates to remelt there .
For example , the giant Qulong deposit ( 1420 Mt at 0 . 5 % Cu and 0 . 03 % Mo ; is partly hosted by Jurassic dacitic lavas .
The genesis of continental collision - related porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) remains controversial .
These are the Jurassic arc suites associated with Cu - Au deposits ( e . g . , Xiongcun , Laze , and Zemoduola ; Tafti et al . , 2009 ) , and the Miocene post - collisional suites associated with Cu - Mo deposits ( e . g . , Qulong , Jiama , Tinggong , and Chongjiang ; Hou et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions of rocks from the western and eastern segments are distinct .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions with those of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Recently , such PCDs have been found in collisional zones such as that in Tibet , where they are associated with post - collisional magmas emplaced as isolated complexes within the Jurassic - Cretaceous magmatic arcs ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
We suggest that systematic zircon e Hf measurement could be effective in identifying the most prospective areas during regional targeting of PCDs .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au and Miocene collision - related Cu - Mo porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au and Miocene collision - related Cu - Mo porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
In contrast , the barren Miocene porphyries have higher ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) t = 15Ma ( 0 . 7063 - 0 . 7101 ) and lower e Nd ( t = 15Ma ) ( - 8 . 1 to - 3 . 1 ) and zircon e Hf ( t ) ( - 8 to + 5 ; Fig . 2 ) .
Compared with the Jurassic rocks , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries have higher light REE and LILE contents , and lower HREE and HFSE contents with steeper HREE patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) .
By contrast , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are free of inherited zircons , and have relatively " depleted " isotopic compositions and younger Hf model ages ( average 800 Ma ) , suggesting a juvenile source ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2013a .

In addition , the Miocene Cu - Morelated porphyries have higher Sr / Y ratios ( 23 - 186 ) and higher ( La / Yb ) N ratios ( 11 - 47 ) than the Jurassic rocks , showing geochemical affinity with adakite ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .

In addition , these barren porphyries yield relatively old crustal Hf model ages ( average ca .
All porphyries have zircon U - Pb ages of 26 - 13 Ma with a peak at 16 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2013a ) , and the associated PCDs have molybdenite Re - Os ages of 17 - 14 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2009 ) , postdating subduction - related Jurassic PCDs by at least 150 m . y .
These results imply that incorporation of crustal components during underplating of Jurassic magma induced copper accumulation as sulfides at the base of the eastern Jurassic arc , inhibiting PCD formation at this time .
Typical examples include : the Miocene post - collisional Kerman porphyry Cu belt , occurring within a non - economic Eocene magmatic arc in Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) ; the Cretaceous giant PCDs , developed along the Mesozoic Qinling orogen in central China ( Dong et al . , 2011 ) ; and the Jurassic giant Dexing PCD , formed on a Mesozoic intra - continental orogen in east China ( Hou et al . , 2013b ) .
In contrast , localization of Miocene PCDs within the Jurassic arc implies that metal - rich Jurassic cumulates could release Cu into the Miocene porphyry systems ( Lee et al . . , 2012 ) .
Our new evidence suggests that remelting of sulfide - bearing , lower crustal cumulates of former arc magmas associated with subductionrelated PCDs could produce giant collisionrelated PCDs .
The Lhasa terrane , bounded by the Meso - Tethyan Bangong - Nujiang suture and the Neo - Tethyan Indus - Yarlung Zangbo suture ( Fig . 1A ) , is composed of Precambrian crystalline basement and Paleozoic - Mesozoic shallow marine clastic strata .
These magmas are thought to derive by remelting of a thickened juvenile mafic lower crust ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) resulting from previous arc magmatism ( Richards , 2009 ; Hou et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ) with subduction - associated PCDs ( Tafti et al . , 2009 ) .
Other PCDs are ~ 20 - 50 km away from Jurassic magmatic rocks ( Fig . 1B ) .
These data suggest that remelting of the lower crustal sulfide - bearing Cu - rich Jurassic cumulates , triggered by Cenozoic crustal thickening and / or subsequent slab break - off , led to the formation of giant Miocene PCDs .
The complementary metal endowment of the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic suites ( Fig . 1 ) suggests that enrichment of Cu in the juvenile mafic lower crust , though inhibiting the Jurassic PCD formation , could have provided abundant metals for the Miocene giant PCDs by breakdown of the host sulfides during post - collisional melting .
The remelting scenario is also supported by the subduction - like features of the Miocene ore - related porphyries ( such as Nb - Ta negative anomaly ) , which were inherited from the Jurassic arc magmas ( Richards , 2009 ) .

Geochemical and isotope data suggest that the WSJA arc rocks associated with the subduction - related PCDs derive from subductionmodified asthenospheric mantle ( Fig . 2 ; Fig . DR1 ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .

By contrast , incorporation of older crust by the ESJA basaltic rock , indicated by the lower and variable zircon e Hf ( t ) ( + 1 to + 12 ) , may be responsible for lowering magmatic f O 2 ( e . g . , Ripley and Li , 2013 ) , thus inducing sulfide saturation ( Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) and sequestering Cu - rich sulfides ( Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) in the Jurassic lower - crustal arc cumulates ( Fig . 3 ) .

This model implies a spatial relationship between subduction - and collision - related PCDs , but it is unclear whether a genetic linkage exists .
This is applicable to other orogenic belts , where former arc magmatism left sulfide - bearing metalrich cumulates at the base of the crust ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2012 ) , which provided abundant metals and S for post - subduction or collision - related PCDs during later remelting ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .
The most common hypothesis links their genesis with magmas derived from subduction - modified arc lithosphere .
Thirty - two key samples from the PCDs and relevant magmatic rocks in south Tibet were analyzed for major and trace element chemistry and bulk - rock Sr - Nd and zircon Hf isotopic compositions ( Tables DR1 - DR3 in the GSA Data Repository 1 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons from the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
These observations are consistent with derivation of these ore - related Miocene porphyries by remelting of the juvenile mafic rocks underplated during the Jurassic magmatism .
Our study highlights a spatial overlap and genetic linkage between giant collision - related PCDs and non - economic volcano - plutonic arcs .
Here , we report new geological , geochemical , and isotopic data for Jurassic subductionand Miocene collision - related PCDs in southern Tibet .
This suggests that remelting of the Jurassic cumulates took place in a thickened crust ( > 50 - 55 km ) within the amphibole and garnet stability field ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) , consistent with Cenozoic collision - induced crustal thickening in south Tibet ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .

Therefore , the spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment between subduction - and collision - related porphyry suites could be used for predicting PCD occurrence and assessing the mineralization potential of other tectonically composite orogens .
Porphyry copper systems supply about 75 % of the world ' s copper 1 .
Copper contents of primary magmas are controlled by the oxidation state of their source , which determines the stability of residual sulphide phases , the main host of Cu ( refs 8 , 11 ) : higher oxidation states in the source result in higher Cu contents of the primary magma 8 .

Arcs developed on crust > 30 km thick have median Cu values decreasing at a low rate between 10 and â¼5 wt % MgO ( â¼3 . 5 parts per million ( ppm ) Cu / wt % MgO ) and at a higher rate ( â¼9 ppm Cu / wt % MgO ) below â¼5 wt % MgO .

Arcs with crustal thickness between 20 and 30 km display intermediate trends ( Fig . 1e , f ) .
Averages of median Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot values at 4 - 6 wt % MgO are also significantly correlated for the 23 arcs ( Fig . 2c ) .

Magmatic H 2 O contents and fO 2 play a prominent role in the development of tholeiitic versus calc - alkaline trends [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 18 : high water contents and fO 2 lead to calc - alkaline trends through suppression of plagioclase fractionation and promotion of early magnetite and amphibole fractionation 4 , 6 .

Copper saturation in magmas is intimately bound to the onset of magnetite crystallization 23 , which induces sulphide saturation and consequent Cu sequestration into either a fluid 24 or , more likely , a sulphide melt 25 , 26 .
Arc magmas evolving in thinner crust are systematically enriched in Cu at intermediate MgO contents because of retarded magnetite crystallization , which also produces a tholeiitic trend therein ( Fig . 1c , d ) .

A â¼4 - 6 - Myr - long magmatic evolution in a thick crust arc could thus separate â¼30 - 50 Mt of sulphide - bound Cu km â1 arc , that is , typical amounts of Cu contained in supergiant porphyry - type copper deposits 2 .
The â¼12 Mt Cu Myr â1 km â1 arc carried by magmas in thin arcs correspond to the theoretic average global Cu flux through arcs ( Supplementary Table 5 ) , suggesting that in thin arcs Cu is quantitatively carried by magmas .
Such magmas result from continuous iron depletion during differentiation , in contrast to tholeiitic magmas that show initial iron enrichment during differentiation 3 .
Such magmas result from continuous iron depletion during differentiation , in contrast to tholeiitic magmas that show initial iron enrichment during differentiation 3 .
Such copper accumulations are an essential step in forming porphyry systems [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] .
In these arcs also Fe 2 O 3tot decreases at a lower rate ( â¼0 . 2 wt % Fe 2 O 3tot / wt % MgO ) between 10 and 5 wt % MgO and at a higher rate ( 1 . 3 wt % Fe 2 O 3tot / wt . % MgO ) below â¼5 wt % MgO .
A simple fractional crystallization model using MELTS , a software package for modelling phase equilibria in magmatic systems ( refs 21 , 22 ) , reproduces the observed Fe 2 O 3tot - MgO trends by varying H 2 O contents ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ) .
Trends of Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot versus MgO contents of bulk rocks differ depending on arc thickness ( Fig . 1 ) .
Trends of Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot MgO contents of bulk rocks differ depending on arc thickness ( Fig . 1 ) .
I find that magmas of thicker arcs are systematically more calc - alkaline and more depleted in copper than magmas of thinner arcs .

11 ) median Cu contents in arcs developed on crust < 20 km thick steadily increase at arc - dependent rates to maximum values of â¼200 ppm at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO ( Fig . 1c ) .
Although the magmatic rocks treated here are not associated with mineralization , the previous discussion may explain why specific large - scale environmental factors ( that is , thick crust ) and magmatic features ( that is , calc - alkaline rather than tholeiitic magmas ) represent a favourable general framework for the formation of porphyry copper systems 27 .
Also in these arcs the Cu versus MgO trend is mimicked by Fe 2 O 3tot : median Fe 2 O 3tot first increases at arcdependent rates from â¼10 wt % at 10 wt % MgO to a maximum median value of â¼14 wt % at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO , then sharply decreases to â¼1 wt % at â¼0 wt % MgO .
As far as the water content effect on the calc - alkaline trend is concerned , this correlation is better accounted for by the fact that magmatic evolution occurs on average at deeper crustal levels in thick arcs compared with thin arcs 17 , 19 .
As far as the water content effect on the calc - alkaline trend is concerned , this correlation is better accounted for by the fact that magmatic evolution occurs on average at deeper crustal levels in thick arcs compared with thin arcs 17 , 19 .
As a result , water contents of magmas evolving at higher depth increase rapidly to high values 20 , even at relatively high MgO in the residual melt 17 , because water is incompatible and more soluble at higher pressure .
In contrast , arc magmas evolving in thicker crust start to lose Cu early because of early magnetite crystallization , which also produces a calc - alkaline trend therein ( Fig . 1a , b ) .

They form above subduction zones and are preferentially associated with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
It follows that averages of median Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot contents of magmas at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO for the 23 arcs display significant linear negative correlations with arc crustal thicknesses ( r = 0 . 76 , p < 0 . 0001 for Cu and r = 0 . 71 , p < 0 . 0003 for Fe 2 O 3tot , excluding the anomalously thick Central Andes : Fig . 2a , b ) .

As the onset of magnetite crystallization is controlled by crustal thickness ( Fig . 2b ) , median Cu contents of arc magmas at MgO â¼4 - 6 wt % also correlate significantly with crustal thickness for the Quaternary arcs ( Fig . 2a ) .
The formation of calc - alkaline magmas is favoured by high water content and oxygen fugacity 4 - 7 .

The behaviour of Cu during magmatic evolution is illustrated using plots of Cu and total iron expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ( Fe 2 O 3tot ) versus MgO contents ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .

The differential Cu evolution in thin ( tholeiitic ) and thick ( calc - alkaline ) arcs implies that magmatic products in thin arcs carry on average â¼12 Mt Cu Myr â1 km â1 arc , whereas those in thick arcs carry on average only 4 Mt Cu Myr â1 km â1 arc ( Supplementary Table 4 and Fig . 2 ) .

Figure 2b shows that the thicker the arc crust the more calc - alkaline ( less Fe 2 O 3tot - enriched at MgO â¼4 - 6 wt % ) are magmas ( see also refs 16 , 17 ) .
Figure 2b shows that the thicker the arc crust the more calc - alkaline magmas ( see also refs 16 , 17 ) .
It is noteworthy that the Fe 2 O 3tot content at 4 - 6 wt % MgO is equivalent to the tholeiitic index of ref .

It has been suggested that sequestration of Cu by magmatic sulphides in the lower crust or at the crust - mantle boundary during a protracted period could play a critical role in the formation of porphyry copper systems by creating Cu pre - concentrations in specific arc segments that may be prone to mobilization by later magmas [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] .
This implies that the missing copper in the former accumulates as copper sulphides within or at the base of thicker arcs .
The authors inferred that the Cu lost by evolving arc magmas is sequestered by sulphide phases in the lower crust .
The inverse correlation between tholeiitic character ( Fe 2 O 3tot enrichment at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO ) and arc thickness ( Fig . 2b ) suggests that magmas evolving in thicker arcs are richer in H 2 O and more oxidized than those evolving in thinner arcs .
The inverse correlation between tholeiitic character ( Fe 2 O 3tot enrichment at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO ) and arc thickness ( Fig . 2b ) suggests that magmas evolving in thicker arcs are richer H 2 O and more oxidized than those evolving in thinner arcs .
Additionally , it is likely that fO 2 correlates positively with water contents during deep crustal evolution 17 enhancing the effect of crustal thickness on the development of the calc - alkaline trend .
These characteristics , as well as magmatic metal contents , are thought to be imparted in the mantle source by fluids of the subducted slab 8 - 10 .
Despite the commonly held view that arc magmas are more hydrous and oxidized at the mantle source than mid - ocean ridge basalts 9 , 10 ( MORB ) and therefore should also be richer in chalcophile metals ( Cu , Au ; ref .

The global scale correlations among arc crustal thickness , Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot have important implications for the understanding of firstorder factors controlling the development of calc - alkaline versus tholeiitic trends and Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas .

Yet this process does not explain why porphyry copper systems preferentially occur in thicker arcs 1 , 2 .
A previous study 11 has also shown that arc magmas sooner or later undergo Cu depletion during evolution and attributed this to varying oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) conditions during magmatic differentiation .
The results presented here suggest that larger amounts of Cu can be concentrated within or at the base of the crust of thicker arc segments and may provide a consistent explanation to why porphyry copper systems form preferentially ( although not exclusively ) in thick arcs in association with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
These results suggest that the thickness of the overriding plate provides a more important control on magma differentiation than the composition of the mantle source , and can explain the preferential association of porphyry copper systems with calc - alkaline magmas and thicker arcs .
The positive correlation between averages of median Fe 2 O 3tot and Cu contents at â¼4 - 6 wt % MgO for the 23 arcs ( Fig . 2c ) supports an Earth - scale role for magnetite controlling Cu saturation in arc magmas .

The above arguments suggest that the processes of Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas , which may ultimately play an important role in the Cu deficit of the continental crust and in the formation of porphyry copper deposits 11 , are controlled by the upper plate .

Starting from initial values between 50 and 100 ppm at 10 wt % MgO ( similar to Cu in thicker arcs and in MORB ; ref .
Owing to its large - scale approach , implying comparisons among entire arc segments , this investigation is necessarily about first - order factors controlling the behaviour of copper in arc magmas .
In contrast , following the same reasoning , there is a deficit of â¼8 Mt Cu Myr â1 km â1 arc in magmas of thick arcs , which implies loss of magmatic Cu and its sequestration within the thick crust as copper sulphides .

Nonetheless , as shown by the heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of porphyry - type deposits also within thick arcs 12 , only a special combination of regional to local scale conditions 28 will ultimately allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems within the generally favourable environment of thick arcs .
Here I present a statistical assessment of more than 40 , 000 published geochemical analyses of magmatic rocks from 23 Quaternary - aged volcanic arcs worldwide .
To reduce the bias induced by outliers and to extract information on general trends , data of each arc were statistically treated by calculating median values of Cu , Fe 2 O 3tot and MgO for subpopulations corresponding to intervals â¼0 . 5 wt % MgO ( Supplementary Table 2 ) .
This correlation cannot be explained by source effects alone : in such cases the strong control of upper plate thickness on the development of the tholeiitic / calc - alkaline trends would not be expected .

Single - stage depleted - mantle model ages ( TDM ) were calculated using the measured 176Lu / 177Hf ratios , referred to a model depleted mantle with a present - day 176Hf / 177Hf = 0 . 28325 , similar to that of the average MORB ( Nowell et al . 1998 ) and 176Lu / 177Hf = 0 . 0384 ( Griffin et al . 2000 ) ; this is similar , though not identical , to the depleted mantle curve defined by juvenile rocks through time ( Vervoort and Blichert - Toft , 1999 ) .
Zircon UâPb ages for quartz - monzonite porphyry stock in Kighal indicate that magma crystallization occurred in the early Miocene between 20 . 0 Â± 0 . 2 and 18 . 8 Â± 0 . 2 Ma ( Fig . 8 ) .
The Kighal porphyry stock is also younger than the porphyritic granodiorite stock in Niaz , dated at 22 . 14 Â± 0 . 13 Ma by 40Ar / 39Ar ( Hassanpour et al . , 2015 ) .
The AharâJolfa zone shares many magmatic , geodynamic and mineralization features of Cenozoic age with magmatism and mineralization in the Meghri - Ordubad pluton ( MOP ) formed in southern Armenia , which is part of the South Armenian Block ( SAB ) ( Fig . 10 ) .
Molybdenite is disseminated within the early - stage quartz veinlets , especially at their walls , as well as within the 25 groundmass in the potassic alteration zone .
Sphalerite and galena are mainly present in marginal parts of the porphyry stock , occurring within the quartzâsulfide and carbonateâ sulfide veinlets .
Goethite is the main supergene mineral within the leached and oxidized zone accompanied by lesser amounts of jarosite , hematite , malachite and azurite .
Zircon UâPb dating of the quartz - monzonite porphyry stock in Kighal yielded ages ranging from 20 . 0 Â± 0 . 2 Ma to 18 . 8 Â± 0 . 2 Ma , corresponding to the early Miocene age .
The Th / U ratios of the zircons range between 0 . 37 and 0 . 59 , corresponding to the values for magmatic zircons .
The quartz monzonite porphyry stock at Kighal in northwestern Iran intruded the Upper Eocene andesite to latite and basalt units , and the resulted hydrothermal activities led to the development of hydrothermal alteration zones , including potassic , phyllic , argillic and propylitic , coupled with Cu mineralization .
The quartz monzonite porphyry stock at Kighal is one of the numerous Cenozoic intrusions in this zone , located ~ 12 km north of the city of Varzeghan .
The TDM C ages for the analyzed zircons are about 429 . 6 â 640 . 5 Ma ( Table 2 ) .
The Cadomian middle - lower continental crust was later involved in formation of Cenozoic magmatic rocks .

The Kighal porphyry stock is therefore slightly younger than the porphyry stock and mineralization at Sungun , for which zircon UâPb ages of porphyritic quartz - monzonite 22 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 stock range from 22 . 1 Â± 0 . 5 Ma to 20 . 1 Â± 0 . 4 Ma ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ) , whereas molybdenite ReâOs dating yielded ages between 22 . 9 Â± 0 . 2 and 21 . 7 Â± 0 . 2 Ma ( Simmonds et al . , 2017 ) .
This mineralizing event is characterized by the precipitation of chalcopyrite indicative of an additional Cu endowment stage at Kighal .
Other dike series underwent weak propylitic alteration and do not show cross - cutting relationship with veinlets ( hydro - fracturing effects ) , indicating that their intrusion took place after the last shattering event .

Such wide ranges of salinities and homogenization temperatures were also reported by many workers from typical PCDs throughout the world ( e . g . , Etminan , 1978 ; Wilkinson , 2001 ; Gonzalez - Partida and Levresse , 2003 ; Calagari , 2004b ) .

This young magmatic event in the MOP is proposed to be temporally associated with the epithermal mineralization identified in the Kadjaran PCD dated at 20 . 48 Â± 0 . 1 Ma by molybdenite ReâOs method and further constrained by crosscutting relationship and trace element chemistry of the hydrothermal quartz ( i . e . , low Ti and high Al content ) associated with the dated molybdenite ( Rezeau et al . , 2016 , 2019 ) .

These hypogene minerals include pyrite , chalcopyrite and molybdenite , along with lesser amounts of sphalerite and galena at the marginal parts of the porphyry stock .
4 . 3 Hf isotopic data interpretation With the exception of the lowest ÎµHf ( t ) value of 2 . 7 that characterizes an inherited zircon , the obtained ÎµHf ( t ) values from Kighal porphyry stock range between 6 . 7 and 10 and indicate a juvenile and homogeneous magmatic source and the predominance of mantle - 608 derived magmas with limited crustal assimilation .

Further petrographic and microthermometric evidence such as the occurrence of two - phase and multiphase inclusions homogenizing over the same temperature range , as well as systematic distribution of the densities of liquid - and vapor - rich two - phase inclusions testify to the occurrence of liquid - vapor immiscibility ( boiling ) and separation of a high - salinity liquid phase from a low - salinity vapor - rich phase .

A large Tertiary batholith , known as MeghriâOrdubad pluton ( MOP ) occurs in southern Armenia and hosts several porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) , including the world - class Kadjaran and Agarak PCDs , along with the associated precious and base metal epithermal mineralization .

The main copper mineral is chalcopyrite , which occurs as disseminations , and as minor phase within the quartzâsulfide and carbonateâsulfide veinlets .
Based on different geodynamic models of Iran , the study area belongs to the AlborzâAzarbaidjan magmatic zone ( Nabavy , 1976 ; StÃ¶cklin , 1977 ; Alavi , 1991 ) and the Central Iranian domain ( Agha Nabaty , 2004 ) .
Moreover , mineralization of sphalerite and galena also took place at the marginal parts of the porphyry stock .
However , exhumation combined with erosion swept off much of these zones at Kighal and moreover , concluding based on the mineralogical observations , it can be said that due to relatively low abundance of pyrite and Cu - sulfides in the hypogene mineralization , the descending supergene fluids had low acidity and lower capacity and availability for leaching Cu from the oxidized zone .

Moreover , metal fractionation occurs during the fluid immiscibility , and a significant fraction of Cu and Mo was transported by the vapor phase .
Presence of zircons with juvenile signatures in NW Iran suggests that the geotectonic setting during Cadomian was an Ediacaran continental magmatic arc and probably a neighboring back - arc basin , inferred from the occurrence of Ediacaran ophiolitic slices in NW Iran ( Shafaii Moghadam et al . , 2017 ) .
Though the magmatism and related porphyry mineralization at Kighal belong to the youngest epoch in northwestern Iran , the quartz monzonite porphyry stock of Kighal is older than all the PCD - host stocks in the central and southeastern ( Kerman ) parts of the UDMA ( 17 . 9 to 6 . 2 Ma ) , which are distributed along the UDMA with a younging trend towards the southeast , with ages ranging from middle to late Miocene ( e . g . , Chiu et al . , 2013 ; Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ) .
Therefore , quartz crystals have entrapped fluid inclusions with different TH ( L - V ) and salinity values .
Meanwhile , fluid neutralization 20 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 by wall - rock reaction appears to be the main driving force for Zn and Pb deposition in more distal portions of the porphyry system ( Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ) , which is also evident at Kighal .

The analyzed zircons mainly possess initial ÎµHf ( t ) values of 6 . 7 to 10 . 0 , which suggest a juvenile and homogeneous magmatic source and the predominance of mantle - derived magmas with limited crustal assimilation .
In general , TDM ages represent a minimum age for the source material of the host magma from which the zircon crystallized .
After that the porphyry stock was exposed to surface weathering processes with development of an oxidized and leached zone above the existing ground water table and a supergene sulfide blanket in phreatic zone , leading to ore enrichment represented by the replacement of supergene sulfide minerals .
Based upon the micro - thermometric studies on the primary two - phase and multiphase ( containing halite , sylvite , hematite and opaque daughter minerals ) fluid inclusions present within the quartzâsulfide veinlets ( v1 and v2 types ) from the potassic and phyllic alteration zones , the temperature range of sulfide mineralization at Kighal was determined to be mainly about 240â550ÂºC ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) , which is consistent with the range of temperature determined for CuâFe sulfide mineralization in most PCDs ( Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Field et al . , 2005 ) .
The different phase ratios observed within inclusions of any type ( two - phase or multiphase ) can also be attributed to the entrapment from boiling and heterogeneous hydrothermal fluids ( Wilkinson , 2001 ) .
Variations of ÎµHf ( t ) in the studied zircons cannot be accounted for different magmas with different ages ( e . g .

A complementary 40Ar / 39Ar cooling age of 20 . 1 Â± 1 . 8 Ma for shreddy biotites formed in the potassic alteration zone of the Kighal porphyry stock ( Hassanpour et al . , 2015 ) overlap with the zircon UâPb ages within uncertainties and further support a relationship between magma crystallization and hydrothermal alteration associated with the CuâMo mineralization .
Intrusion of the first generation of quartzâdioritic dikes ( qd1 ) probably occurred during this stage , which are weakly to moderately sericitized , containing some euhedral pyrite crystals but no copper sulfides .

According to the 40Ar / 39Ar age data of Hassanpour et al . ( 2015 ) , the Kighal porphyry stock is also coeval with a porphyritic granodiorite emplaced in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD ( 20 km to the NW ) , yielding cooling ages of 19 . 46 Â± 0 . 39 Ma ( biotite ) and 27 . 47 Â± 0 . 17 Ma ( hornblende ) , respectively .
The more realistic two - stage Hf model ages ( TDM C ) of the source rocks for the magmas have also been calculated by projecting the initial 176Hf / 177Hf of the zircon back to the depleted mantle model growth curve , assuming a mean crustal value for Lu / Hf ( 176Lu / 177Hf = 0 . 015 ; Griffin et al . 2002 ) .
4 . 1 Sequence of the hydrothermal events Zircon UâPb age data constrain the crystallization of the sub - volcanic quartz monzonite porphyry stock at Kighal to the early Miocene .
During the early stage of fluid activity , potassic alteration zone was developed within the inner parts of the porphyry stock , characterized by the precipitation of pyrite , molybdenite and chalcopyrite as disseminated ore and veinlets .
This is characterized by zircon UâPb ages ranging from 30 . 20 Â± 0 . 90 to 26 . 60 Â± 0 . 80 Ma ( mean of 27 . 35 Â± 0 . 71 ) and molybdenite ReâOs ages ranging from 28 . 71 Â± 0 . 46 to 28 . 06 Â± 0 . 47 Ma ( Aghazadeh et al . 2015 ) .
A third aliquot of larger biotite grains yielded a minimum age of 717 â¼19 . 5 Ma .
Moreover , the salinity of fluid inclusions ranges from 1 . 4 to 70 wt % NaCl eq .
For the studied samples , TDM ages range from 275 . 4 to 410 . 8 Ma ( Table 2 , Fig . 9b ) , showing Paleozoic ( Early Devonian to Early Permian ) minimum ages for the source materials .
This belt comprises several cupriferous metallogenic zones , including AharâJolfa , Central Iran and Kerman , and hosts the largest Iranian porphyry CuâMo deposits , including Sar Cheshmeh ( Kerman zone ; Shahabpour , 1982 ) and Sungun ( NW Iran ; Calagari , 1997 , 2004a ) .
These tendencies lead to the metal zonation observed in the porphyry systems , including the Kighal prospect .
Following the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids and changes in their physico - chemical characteristics ( discussed in the next section ) , phyllic and argillic alteration zones were developed in the Kighal porphyry system .

The main reactions during the potassic alteration , which are also evident in the Kighal porphyry system , include introduction of K + , removal of Ca2 + and Na + released from replacement of plagioclase by K - feldspar , hydration , and oxidation or sulfidation of Fe ( forming magnetite or pyrite ) released from destruction of biotite and hornblende and their replacement by Mg - rich ( e . g . , Arnott and Zentilli , 2003 ) shreddy biotites ( e . g . , Bean , 1983 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ) .

Occurrence of magnetite in the potassic zone at Kighal may be attributed to the dominance of SO2 coupled with undersaturation of sulfide species in the magmaticâ hydrothermal fluids during the early period of the hydrothermal activity in this area ( Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2002 ) .
Similarly , the wide range of bulk density values in coexisting set of inclusions testifies to entrapment from heterogeneous boiling fluids during multiple events of phase immiscibility .
Considering the paragenesis of hypogene sulfide minerals in Kighal ore ( pyrite + chalcopyrite Â± bornite ) and their association with magnetite in the potassic zone , it can be concluded that the sulfidation state of ore - bearing fluids at Kighal was intermediate .
However , it is coeval with the mineralization at the monzodioritic stock in the Masjed Daghi porphyry Cu prospect , the age of mineralization in which has been constrained at 20 . 46 Â± 3 . 55 Ma using molybdenite ReâOs method ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ) , though no age data is available for the porphyry stock yet .
According to the study results , pyrite is the most abundant sulfide mineral at Kighal , occurring as disseminations within the porphyry stock and also as the dominant phase within the quartzâsulfide , carbonateâsulfide , anhydrite - gypsum and pyrite veinlets .
This age corresponds to the third magmatic and mineralization epoch of porphyry copper deposits and prospects in northwestern Iran ( Simmonds et al . , 2017 ) and shows an overlap with the mineralization age in the Masjed Daghi PCD and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , while it is slightly younger than the porphyritic quartz - monzonite stock in Sungun PCD and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Niaz porphyry Cu prospect .
As further evidence confirming the low pH of the ore - bearing hydrothermal fluids is the occurrence of argillic alteration in the Kighal porphyry system , which requires relatively higher acidity conditions ( e . g . , Titley and Bean , 1981 ) .
As further evidence confirming the low pH of the ore - bearing hydrothermal fluids is the occurrence of argillic alteration in the Kighal porphyry system , which requires relatively higher acidity conditions ( e . g . , Titley and Bean , 1981 ) .
It must be noted that presence of chalcopyrite ( triangular opaque crystals ) and other opaque daughter minerals within the studied multiphase fluid inclusions , along with the occurrence of these minerals within the quartz veinlets confirms that these inclusions contain samples of ore - forming fluids .
These magmatic events brought about CuâMo porphyry deposits and prospects ( e . g . , world - class Kadjaran and Agarak on the Armenian side and Sungun and Haft Cheshmeh on the Iranian side ) and spatially associated precious and base metal epithermal occurrences in both areas ( Moritz et al . , 2016b ) .

Comparing the ages obtained for the Kighal deposit with porphyry CuâMo mineralizations in the southern Lesser Caucasus indicates that this deposit is younger than all of the dated PCDs and prospects in the MOP , even the youngest events associated with the epithermal mineralization in the Kadjaran PCD , while the studied stock is almost older than all the dated PCDs in the central and southeastern parts of the UDMA .
Both these areas are characterized by Eoceneâ Oligocene calc - alkaline to MioceneâPliocene adakitic magmatic suites with pulsating nature , occurring during progressive evolution from a Neo - Tethys subduction to a post - collisional setting , as Arabia and Gondwana - derived terranes converged with Eurasia ( Sosson et al . , 2010 , Moritz et al . , 2016b ) .
4 . 4 Temporal relationship between the Kighal porphyry stock and the neighboring intrusive bodies and porphyry host stocks In general , porphyry CuâMo deposits in Iran are predominantly located along the UDMA , including the AharâJolfa , Central Iran and Kerman metallogenic zones ( Fig . 1 ) .

These ages correspond to the Cadomian ( Ediacaran to middle Cambrian ) arc - related magmatic event in NW Iran , which was part of a ~ 100 m . y .
By taking into account the development of hydrothermal alteration zones and their spatial distribution , stockwork - type mineralization of CuâMo minerals , and even the occurrence of mineralization zoning with CuâMo - rich ore within the stock and CuâPbâZn ore in the marginal parts , mineralization at Kighal in association with the quartz monzonite sub - volcanic stock can be regarded as of porphyry copper type .
But after further cooling ( < 400ï°C ) of SO2 - bearing hydrothermal fluids , hydrolysis caused the conversion of SO2 species into H2S and H2SO4 , which brought about the precipitation of sulfide and sulfate minerals in the Kighal porphyry system .
Also , according to the same diagram , the acidity and logfO2 of the ore - forming hydrothermal fluids at Kighal were estimated to be â¤5 and - 34 to - 37 , respectively .
Hassanpour et al . ( 2015 ) proposed that mineralization in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD is associated with the porphyritic granodiorite .
Adamia et al . ( 1981 , 2011 ) include the South Armenia terrane together with the Sanandajâ Sirjan zone into the Central Iranian platform since the Jurassic , an interpretation which is shared by Golonka ( 2004 ) and Alavi ( 2007 ) .
It is further confirmed by the presence of cross - cutting quartz veinlets , along with banded texture and re - opening evidence within the quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets ( especially v1 type ) , as well as hydrothermal breccia found in the area , which also indicate the occurrence of multiple hydraulic fracturing events during the lifetime of the porphyry stock , most likely related to repeated boiling events and various stages of phase separation within the hydrothermal fluids .
The AharâJolfa zone is one of the prestigious Tertiary metallogenic zones in Iran , which is characterized by the occurrence of porphyry , skarn and vein - type mineralization of base and precious metals .

This led to the instability and breakdown of metal transporting complexes and consequently to metal deposition .
Taking into account the published ages for the PCDs and prospects in AharâJolfa zone , Simmonds et al . ( 2017 ) proposed three epochs of magmatic - hydrothermal activities associated with porphyry Cu mineralization , including the late Eocene with the Saheb Divan PCD , the middle Oligocene associated with the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , Siah Kamar porphyry Mo deposit and the vein - type porphyry - like CuâMoâAu mineralization in the Qarachilar area , and the early Miocene characterized by the formation of Sungun , Masjed Daghi and Niaz PCDs and prospects ( Fig . 10 ) .

Ayati et al . ( 2013 ) dated three aliquots of separated shreddy biotite from the potassic alteration zone affecting the diorite to granodiorite host intrusion , as well as a sericite separate from the phyllic alteration zone by 40Ar / 39Ar .
Therefore , different types and generations of aqueous fluid inclusions with different TH ( L - V ) and salinity values might be entrapped during these events .
Hemley et al . ( 1980 ) have also suggested that potassic alteration zone developed at temperature range of 350â600ÂºC .
However , Aghazadeh et al . ( 2015 ) reported two molybdenite ReâOs ages of 28 . 18 Â± 0 . 42 and 27 . 05 Â± 0 . 37 Ma from this deposit , which are inconsistent with the cooling age of the porphyritic granodiorite .
Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) stated that the majority of porphyry copper deposits , which contain magnetite , either without sulfides or as part of ore - grade assemblages of bornite and / or chalcopyrite , as well as those with the dominance of pyrite + chalcopyrite ore zone , are of intermediate sulfidation state .
One exception to this general trend along the whole UDMA is the porphyritic granodiorite stock of the Bondar Hanza PCD in the Kerman zone ( Fig . 1 ) .
In general , the observed old to young age trend for intrusive bodies and mineralization from SAB and the northwestern end of the UDMA towards its southeastern end confirms that magmatism , even in the later post - collisional setting has temporally migrated towards the southeast of this arc .
Griffin et al . 2000 ) , since all show very similar UâPb ages .
The age data show that it is a little younger than the quartz - monzonite porphyry stock in the Sungun porphyry copper deposit ( PCD ) and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Niaz prospect , while it is almost coeval with the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , as well as with the mineralization at the Masjed Daghi PCD in NW Iran .
This corresponds to the third metallogenic epoch in the AharâJolfa zone .
The late stage is barren , characterized by the formation of late quartz , calcite and anhydriteâgypsum veinlets , along with minor amounts of sulfide minerals , though pyrite is still the dominant sulfide phase .

On the other hand , the underdeveloped characteristics of the sulfide - enriched zone with the predominance of covellite and bornite and the lack of chalcocite also implies that the sulfide - enriched blanket was rather young and did not have enough time to develop due to the uplift and consequent erosion .

It can be concluded that the principal process resulting in the deposition of ore minerals ( especially the stockwork mineralization ) in the studied area was boiling of the hydrothermal fluids ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) during which , acidic volatiles escaped through the resulted hydro - fractures inducing a pH increase ( Barnes , 1979 ) , accompanied by rapid cooling of the fluids due to the abrupt pressure lifting .
Based on the pHâEh diagram provided by John et al . ( 1999 ) for hydrothermal alterations and sulfide minerals , sulfide assemblage of chalcopyrite and low - Fe sphalerite ( fairly translucent with a yellowish color in this case ) found in the Kighal ore are typical and characteristic of intermediate sulfidation state , while the lack of enargite at Kighal shows that sulfidation did not reach a higher state .
Two aliquots , including an aliquot of mixed size population of biotite grains , 716 yielded an age of â¼21 Ma .
Pirajno ( 1992 ) has also shown that at 350ï°C and 1 Kb conditions , alteration of albite to muscovite requires an increase in acidity .
However , these ages overlap within uncertainties with the youngest magmatic event in the MOP , corresponding to the emplacement of the early Miocene adakitic high - K calc - alkaline porphyritic granodioritic intrusions and dikes dated between 22 . 8 Â± 0 . 5 Ma and 21 . 2 Â± 0 . 3 Ma in the Kadjaran mining area ( Moritz et al . , 2016 ; Rezeau et al . , 2016 ) .
The wide ranges of TH ( L - V ) and salinity obtained for the studied fluid inclusions may indicate the presence of different hydrothermal fluids at different times , which is rather 19 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 common in porphyry CuâMo deposits .
This emphasizes the need for more detailed investigations to constrain the magmatic - hydrothermal relationship in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD .
This migration is attributed to the oblique convergence between the Arabian and Central Iranian plates and the diachronous and later age of collision for the SE part of the Neo - Tethyan oceanic basin along the Zagros orogeny compared to its NW section , evidence and mechanisms of which are discussed by Agard et al . ( 2006 , 2011 ) .
Three distinct and separate populations of fluid inclusions were recognized in the salinity vs . TH ( L - V ) plot ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) : high salinity ( halite - bearing ) with wide range of TH ( L - V ) , moderate salinity and low - salinity ( two - phase ) with relatively narrow TH ( L - V ) ranges .

Supergene enriched zone has an average thickness of 25 meters , and mainly contains covellite and lesser amounts of bornite .

It must be acknowledged that these two early stages were responsible for most of the mineralization discovered at Kighal .
Together with Kighal , Sungun , Niaz and Masjed Daghi this supports the occurrence of magmatic - hydrothermal events during the Early Miocene in the region ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ; Moritz et al . , 2016a , b ; Rezeau et al . , 2016 ; Simmonds , 2017 ) .

In this regard , though metal grades are low at Kighal , the first aim of this contribution is to investigate the mineralogical and genetic aspects of the Kighal porphyry CuâMo prospect , compared to the typical features of PCDs , in order to document another porphyry occurrence within the metallogenic belt of Iran and southern Armenia , which is located in the vicinity of well - known Sungun and Haft Cheshmeh PCDs of Iran , but shows low economic value .

Moreover , post - entrapment modifications , such as necking down or leakage can also lead to such variations , evidence of which is common in the quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets at Kighal . Entrapment of solid halite crystals from hydrothermal fluids may have also resulted the high salinity and TH ( L - V ) values measured on these inclusions ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) .

The NE China microcontinental Block was affected by the Mongol - Okhotsk suture ( Fig . 1 ) to the north and the Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) to the south in Permo - Triassic ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Mongol - Okhotsk suture stretches along the southeastern boundary of the Siberian Craton over 3000 km , extending from the present - day Udsky gulf of the Okhotsk Sea to the Khangay mountain range in Central Mongolia ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) .

Calcic to calcalkaline Permian - Triassic magmatic rocks are widespread in the East Kunlun ( [ 15 ] ) formed during the subduction - related orogenic period and the subsequent syn - to post - collision stage ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2015a ) .
The Sulu - Dabie high - to ultrahigh - pressure ( HP - UHP ) metamorphic belt ( [ 21 ] ) formed during the Triassic collision between the North China Craton and Yangtze Craton ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011b ; Deng et al . , 2014c ) .
The main metamorphic rocks in this belt include garnet peridotite , garnet pyroxenite , eclogite , schist , quartzite , marble , and various gneisses ( Ratschbacher et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng , et al . , 2009 ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating of paragneiss , orthogneiss , and eclogite from the Sulu belt indicate that the UHP peak metamorphic event took place at ~ 240 - 220Ma ( Fig . 1 ) , and then overprinted by amphibolite - facies retrograde metamorphic at ~ 220 - 210 Ma ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .
Biotite and muscovite Ar - Ar thermochronology of mylonitic gneiss from Sulu belt suggest that the UHP metamorphic rocks started to exhume at ~ 220 - 200 Ma ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .

Jurassic to Cretaceous subduction system
The Jurassic to Cenozoic subduction systems are developed both along southwestern and eastern margins of China .
Southward oceanic subduction of the Bangong - Nujiang Ocean from the Permian to the Early Cretaceous gave rise to extensive calc - alkaline magmatism on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Zhang et al . , 2012b ) .
The westward flat subduction of the Paleo - Pacific oceanic crust resulted in extensive late - Mesozoic magmatism dominantly along the eastern margin of China , named East Coast Arc ( [ 28 ] ) in this paper ( Fig . 1 ) .

A series of near NS - striking normal fault systems mark the east - west extension ( Coleman and Hodges , 1995 ; Blisniuk et al . , 2001 ) .

The superimposed orogenesis , including the superimposing between different episodes of accretionary orogeny , collisional orogeny , mantle plume , and demantling can be summarized into the following categories : ( 1 ) continental collision superimposed on the pre - Cenozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab in the Emeishan large igneous province as described in section 2 . 4 ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .
and Pacific plate subduction ( e . g . , Sun et al . , 2007 ) , and mainly developed on the Paleoproterozoic suture ( Li et al . , 2012a ; Deng and Wang , 2015 ) .

The subduction of the main Paleo - Tethyan oceanic crust and those of its branches generated arc magmatism as well as S - type granitoids ( Figs . stage , after the lithosphere has been thickened , the lithospheric mantle was removed leading to the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism in the northern margin of Tibet and Sanjiang belts during 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2005 ; ) .

The superimposed orogeny in Tibet and Sanjiang is characterized by the spatial overlap between the accretionary orogenesis during the evolution of Tethyan oceans and the Indian - Eurasian continental collision ( Figs . 12 and 14 ) .
The shearing disaggregated the ophiolite forming mÃ©lange zone , and the magmatism developed along the Tethyan or even earlier subduction zones developed with subduction - related igneous rocks .
The lithosphere shortening and rotation , as well as lower lithospheric mantle removal , which was considered to have triggered the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism ( Deng et al . , 2014b ) , has largely reshaped the lithospheric structure .
The metallogenic types in these two types of orogenesis are also different .
The subduction rate is smaller , andesites are generally dominant , and the lithosphere thickens , with a greater contribution to the growth of the continental lithosphere ( Doglioni et al . , 2007 ) .
The ancient sutures between blocks , craton margins , and arcs acted as favorable locations for the production of ore deposit during the later tectonic events ( Fig . 18 ) .
The sutures in North China Craton include the Inner Mongolia suture , Trans - North China Orogen and Jiao - Liao - Ji Belt , as well as those between the smaller Archean blocks ( Fig . 7 ) .

Another important fact for the spatial preferences is the lithosphere structure vulnerable to tectonic reactivation and relatively high crust permeability .

Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .

The systems also contain major resources of these metals as well as including the world ' s largest known exploitable concentrations of Cu ( 203 Mt : Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco , central Chile ; A . J .
Typical hypogene porphyry Cu deposits have average grades of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent Cu , < 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 percent Mo , and 0 . 0Ã to 1 . 5 g / t Au , although a few " Auonly " deposits have Au tenors of 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 g / t but little Cu ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Porphyry Cu systems show a marked tendency to occur in linear , typically orogen - parallel belts , which range from a few tens to hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long , as exemplified by the Andes of western South America ( Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 ; Fig . 2 ) and the Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt of Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria ( JankoviÄ , 1977 ; Popov et al . , 2002 ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu belts developed during well - defined metallogenic epochs , which isotopic dating shows to have typical durations of 10 to 20 m . y .
Individual porphyry Cu belts are commonly spatially separate rather than superimposed on one another , reflecting arc migration as a result of steepening or shallowing of subducted slabs between the individual magmatic - metallogenic epochs ( e . g . , Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems are generated mainly in magmatic arc ( including backarc ) environments subjected to a spectrum of regional - scale stress regimes , apparently ranging from moderately extensional through oblique slip to contractional ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Large high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Faults and fault intersections are invariably involved , to greater or lesser degrees , in determining the formational sites and geometries of porphyry Cu systems and their constituent parts .
Intra - arc fault systems , active before as well as during magmatism and porphyry Cu generation , are particularly important localizers , as exemplified by the Domeyko fault system during development of the preeminent middle Eocene to early Oligocene belt of northern Chile ( Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 , and references therein ; Fig . 2 ) .
Arc - parallel alignments may occur along intra - arc fault zones , as exemplified by the Chuquicamata district , northern Chile ( Fig . 3b ) whereas cross - arc fault zones or lineaments control arc - transverse alignments , as in the Cadia , New South Wales ( Fig . 3c ) and Oyu Tolgoi , Mongolia districts ( Fig . 3d ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Outcropping precursor plutons normally represent the shallower , earlier consolidated parts rather than the magma volumes from which the fluids for porphyry Cu generation were derived ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline or , less commonly , alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .
Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Massive carbonate sequences , particularly where marble is developed near intrusive contacts , and other poorly fractured , fine - grained rocks have the capacity to act as relatively Serrano et al . , 1996 ; J . C . Toro , writ .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may be similarly blind , beneath a thick limestone sequence in the case of Pueblo Viejo .
Ferrous Fe - rich lithologic units also appear to favor highgrade porphyry Cu mineralization ( e . g . , Ray and Mineral Park , Arizona ; Phillips et al . , 1974 ; Wilkinson et al . , 1982 ) , presumably because of their capacity to effectively precipitate Cu transported in oxidized magmatic fluids ( see below ) .
Mineralization elsewhere in porphyry Cu systems may be even more profoundly influenced by rock type .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .
Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small irregular bodies .
Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Wall - rock xenoliths in the marginal parts of some porphyry intrusions may be sufficiently abundant to constitute intrusion breccias .
Mo - rich porphyry Cu deposits are normally tied to the more felsic intrusions , whereas Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits tend to be related to the more mafic end members , although intrusions as felsic as quartz monzonite may also host Au - rich examples ( e . g . , Mamut , East Malaysia ; KÃ³saka and Wakita , 1978 ) .
Diatreme breccias have a distinctive texture , in which widely separated , typically centimeter - sized clasts are dominated by rock - flour matrix containing an andesitic to dacitic tuffaceous component ( Table 1 ) , the latter commonly difficult to recognize where alteration is intense .

Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
The breccia clasts may be set in rock - flour matrix , hydrothermal cement , fine - grained igneous material , or some combination of the three .
Igneous matrices tend to be more common at depth near the magmatic source , where the term igneous breccia is appropriately applied ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , generally occupying steep , pipelike to irregular bodies , are commonly intermineral in timing as a result of being generated in close association with intermineral porphyry phases ( Figs . 6 , 8 ) .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Sericitized breccia may change downward to potassic - altered breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Phreatic breccias , as exemplified by pebble dikes , normally contain polymictic clast populations set in muddy , rock - flour matrices ( Table 1 ) .
The tops of the orebodies tend to be relatively abrupt and controlled by the apices of quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The shape of any porphyry Cu orebody may undergo significant modification as a result of emplacement of late - to postmineral rock volumes ( e . g . , Fig . 5a ) , as exemplified by the low - grade cores caused by internal emplacement of latemineral porphyry phases ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Philippines ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) and , much less commonly , latestage diatremes ( e . g . , El Teniente ; Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Camus , 2003 ) .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag Â± Cu Â± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Alteration - mineralization zoning in porphyry Cu deposits
Porphyry Cu deposits display a consistent , broad - scale alteration - mineralization zoning pattern that comprises , centrally from the bottom upward , several of sodic - calcic , potassic , chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and advanced argillic ( cf .
Chloritic and propylitic alteration develop distally at shallow and deeper levels , respectively ( Fig . 10 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Sericitic alteration may project vertically downward as an annulus separating the potassic and propylitic zones as well as cutting the potassic zone centrally as shown .
Sericitic alteration tends to be more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits , whereas chlorite - sericite alteration develops preferentially in porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration - mineralization in the lithocap is commonly far more complex than shown , particularly where structural control is paramount .
Quartzkaolinite
Sodic - calcic alteration , commonly magnetite bearing ( Table 2 ) , is normally rather poorly preserved at depth in some porphyry Cu deposits , commonly in the immediate wall rocks to the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Panguna , Papua New Guinea and El Teniente ; Ford , 1978 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , a position that may give rise to confusion with propylitic alteration ( Fig . 10 ) .

Sodic - calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Nugget Hill , Philippines ) , in some of which hybrid potassic - calcic ( biotite - actinolite - magnetite ) assemblages are also commonplace ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Ridgeway , and Cotabambas , southern Peru ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Wilson et al . , 2003 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2004a ) .
Biotite is the predominant alteration mineral in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , whereas K - feldspar increases in abundance in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings .
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration ( Table 2 ) , giving rise to distinctive , pale - green rocks , is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , particularly Au - rich examples , where it overprints preexisting potassic assemblages ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10â12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety that is greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .

Distal Au skarns are typically more reduced ( pyroxene rich ) than their proximal counterparts ( Fortitude , Copper Canyon district ; Myers and Meinert , 1991 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits display single veinlet sequences that comply with the generalizations summarized above and ( Barr et al . , 1976 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2002 .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .

PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS in Figure 13 and Table 2 , but repetitions of group 1 and 2 veinlets , for example , early biotite , EDM halo , and A types cut by lesser numbers of later EDM halo and A types ( e . g . , Bingham ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ) , occur where time gaps between porphyry phases are sufficiently large ; however , group 2 and 3 veinlets are only uncommonly repeated .
Magnetite Â± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .

Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Absence anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .
Tourmaline may occur in minor amounts in several veinlet types , even those formed early in deposit histories ( e . g . , T4 veinlets al Los Pelambres ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2007 ) , but it is most abundant with quartz and / or pyrite in D - type veinlet generations and any associated magmatic - hydrothermal breccias affected by sericitic alteration ( Fig . 8 ) .
Advanced argillic lithocaps
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , which may either wholly or partially overlie and conceal porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) or occur alongside them and , hence , above propylitic rock ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina , Argentina , Batu Hijau , and Rosia Poieni , Romania ; Lozada - CalderÃ³n and McPhail , 1996 ; Clode et al . , 1999 ; Milu et al . , 2004 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components of many ledges .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components ledges .
Metal zoning in porphyry Cu systems is well documented , particularly at the deeper , porphyry Cu levels ( e . g . , Jerome , 1966 ; Titley , 1993 ) .
Peripheral veins cutting propylitic halos may also be Au rich , and at Mineral Park an outward zoning from Pb - Zn to Au - Ag is evident ( Eidel et al . , 1968 ; Lang and Eastoe , 1988 ; Fig . 9b ) .

The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious and base metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Magma and fluid production
Porphyry Cu systems typically span the upper 4 km or so of the crust ( Singer et al . , 2008 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) , with their centrally located stocks being connected downward to parental magma chambers at depths of perhaps 5 to 15 km ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ; Fig . 4 ) .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Convection provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of copious amounts of the aqueous phase , in the form of bubble - rich magma , from throughout the parental chambers to the basal parts of porphyry stocks or dike swarms ( Candela , 1991 ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The shallow - level porphyry stocks do not themselves generate the bulk of the magmatic fluid volume , but simply act as " exhaust valves , " conduits for its upward transmission from the parental chambers , perhaps via cupolas on their roofs ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu mineralization in the deeply formed ( up to 9 km ) potassic alteration zones at Butte and elsewhere took place directly from a single - phase , relatively low salinity ( 2â10 wt % NaCl equiv ) , aqueous liquid ( Rusk et al . , 2004 ( Rusk et al . , , 2008a ; such a phase may contain several thousand ppm to several percent of base metals and several ppm Au , based on thermodynamic ( Heinrich , 2005 ) and analytical ( AudÃ©tat et al . , 2008 ) observations .
Fluid inclusion microanalysis and experimental studies reveal that , during phase separation , specific element suites selectively fractionate between the vapor and hypersaline liquid .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S Â± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Potassic alteration and associated metal deposition are initiated under near - lithostatic conditions and involve extensive hydraulic fracturing of the ductile rock at high strain rates ( Fournier , 1999 ) to generate the pervasive stockwork veining ( Burnham , 1979 ) : a process that may give rise to large increases in rock volume ( Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The single - phase liquid , the mineralizer in deeply formed porphyry Cu deposits , may generate the relatively uncommon EDM halo veinlets ( Rusk et al . , 2008a ; Proffett , 2009 ) , whereas the two - phase fluid produces the more common A - and B - type quartz veinlets ( e . g . , Roedder , 1984 , and references therein ) .
The quartz - veined cores of potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .

Fluid pressures may fluctuate from lithostatic to hydrostatic during porphyry Cu formation ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , as a result of both repetitive fracture propagation and sealing and reductions in confining pressure consequent upon surface degradation ( see below ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal brecciation may be triggered by sudden release of fluid overpressures caused by roof failure above large , expanding vapor bubbles ( Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; Burnham , 1985 ) , particularly near the ductile - brittle transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions have crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .

Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10Ã dilution of the hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .
High Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .

The Cordilleran massive sulfide lodes are localized where the liquid follows pronounced structural permeability spanning the sericitic to advanced argillic transition ( Figs . 6 , 10 ) or , less commonly , encounters reactive carbonate rocks ( e . g . , Baumgartner et al . , 2008 ; BendezÃº and FontbotÃ© , 2009 ) .

At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts where porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms are overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .

Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive , thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .

Highly permeable noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .

Porous and permeable volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequences also favor large - tonnage orebody development in the lithocap environment , especially where they happen to be shallowly located with respect to paleosurfaces .

Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
Thermal regimes that permit vertically extensive ore zone development in potassic zones commonly have greater size potential than those that were excessively hot internally , thereby inhibiting sulfide precipitation and giving rise to large , lowgrade or barren cores ; the exception is where the resultant shell - like orebodies are areally extensive and thick ( e . g . , Bingham and Resolution ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .

porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing and bornite - free potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2004b ) .

Structural permeability linking porphyry stocks to the fringes of carbonate rock - dominated districts seems to be a requirement for formation of substantial sediment - hosted Au deposits ( e . g . , Bingham district ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are arguably the most studied and potentially best known and understood ore deposit type ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , and their relationships with the skarn environment have been appreciated for many years ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A positive topographic expression results only where barren , late - to postmineral porphyry plugs intrude the diatreme breccias ( e . g . , Dizon and Guinaoang , Philippines and Batu Hijau ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Fig . 6 ) .
A quartz - pyrite assemblage replaces any carbonate rocks incorporated in advanced argillic lithocaps ( e . g . , Bisbee , Arizona ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
The distinctive aplitic groundmass texture is ascribed to pressure quenching during rapid ascent and consequent volatile loss ( Burnham , 1967 ) .
The pebble dikes and related breccias are chiefly restricted to porphyry Cu deposits , including their marginal parts , whereas brecciation induced by the fluid confinement typifies the overlying highsulfidation epithermal environment ( Fig . 6 ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts of porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
The upper parts of porphyry Cu systems , mainly at shallower levels than their porphyry intrusions , are characterized by lithocaps : lithologically controlled zones of pervasive advanced argillic alteration with structurally controlled components , including their subvertical root zones ( Figs . 4 , 6 , 10 ; Table 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

The parental magmas need to be water rich ( > ~ 4 wt % ) and oxidized in order to maximize the metal contents of the resultant aqueous phase ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Candela , 1992 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; AudÃ©tat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700Â° to 550 Â°C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .

As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ÂºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .

The low - salinity liquid , whose ascent is controlled by the preexisting quartz veinlet stockworks , synmineral faults , and permeability contrasts provided by steep intrusive contacts , appears to be responsible for the progressive formation of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic alteration , as well as continued advanced argillic alteration and the principal Cu and Au mineralization in the overlying lithocaps Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Rusk et al . , 2008b ) .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction to produce liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .

If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps quartz - pyrophyllite Â± muscovite Â± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .
In lithocaps , permeable lithologic units are an especially important control of the largest high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , as mentioned previously , in contrast to tight rocks , such as little - fractured lava domes and flows , which typically host smaller , fault - and fracture - controlled deposits .
The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks , but generally prior to initiation of the systems .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .
The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz - bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration - mineralization .

The Cu and , in places , Au contents of skarns are typically higher still .
Each belt corresponds to a magmatic arc of broadly similar overall dimensions .
The stress regime depends , among other factors , on whether there is trench advance or rollback and the degree of obliquity of the plate convergence vector ( Dewey , 1980 ) .
The precursor plutons may act as hosts to a single deposit , as at Mount Polley , British Columbia ( Fraser et al . , 1995 ) ; an alignment of coalesced deposits , as in the Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco district ( Fig . 5a ) ; or clusters of two or more discrete deposits , as in the El Abra intrusive complex , northern Chile ( Fig . 5b ) and Guichon Creek batholith , Highland Valley district , British Columbia ( Fig . 5c ) .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The precursor pluton is multiphase , whereas the parental pluton is shown as a single body in which the concentric dotted lines mark its progressive inward consolidation .
The volcanic sequence is a stratovolcano ( but could just as readily be a dome complex ; Fig . 6 ) and has been partly eroded prior to porphyry Cu formation .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts of the underlying rocks .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry Cu - related intrusions comprise multiple phases ( Kirkham , 1971 ; Gustafson , 1978 ) , which were emplaced immediately before ( early porphyries ) , during ( intermineral porphyries ) , near the end of ( late mineral porphyries ) , and after ( postmineral porphyries ) the alteration and mineralization events ( Fig . 6 ) .
The earlier porphyry bodies are not destroyed when intruded by later phases but merely split apart , causing overall inflation of the rock package as would occur during ordinary dike emplacement .
The upper contacts of a few porphyry Cu intrusions are characterized by unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) : alternating , crenulate layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyry produced as a result of pressure fluctuations at the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions ( e . g . , Kirkham and Sinclair , 1988 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; .

The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The porphyry intrusions contain variable amounts of phenocrysts , typically including hornblende and / or biotite , and fine - grained , commonly aplitic groundmass , resulting in open to crowded textures .
The porphyry phases in some individual deposits may have clear compositional differences ( e . g . , Bajo de la Alumbrera ; Proffett , 2003 ) and / or characteristic igneous textures ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) ; however , particularly in many porphyry Au and Cu - Au deposits , the different phases are commonly only subtly different or nearly identical .
The poorly lithified , friable nature many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .
Many diatremes are late - stage additions to porphyry Cu systems , in which they commonly postdate and either cut or occur alongside porphyry Cu mineralization at depth ( Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 1998 ; Garwin , 2002 ) but overlap with high - sulfidation events at shallower epithermal levels ( e . g . , Dizon ; Fig . 6 ) .
The diatremes , particularly their contact zones , may localize part of the high - sulfidation Au mineralization ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu , Papua New Guinea ; Fig . 6 ) .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .

The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .
The breccias are typically late - stage features and , hence , unaltered and barren .
The massive , high - sulfidation pyrite - enargite replacements in carbonate rocks are also locally transitional outward through high - to intermediate - sulfidation Zn - Pb - Ag ore , a continuum observed in the Tintic and Colquijirca districts ( Lindgren and Loughlin , 1919 ; BendezÃº et al . , 2003 ; BendezÃº and FontbotÃ© , 2009 ) .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers of rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .

The chalcopyrite Â± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) , with one or more bornite - rich centers characterizing the deeper , central parts of many deposits .

The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .

The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .

The Cu - bearing sulfides typically occur as fine - grained coatings on disseminated pyrite grains , which leads to recognition difficulties in deposits that also underwent supergene Cu sulfide enrichment ( e . g . , Chuquicamata , OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) ; indeed , the hypogene contribution is commonly not distinguished from the supergene enrichment products ( e . g . , Taca Taca Bajo , Argentina ; Rojas et al . , 1999 ) .

The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low ( e . g . , quartz sandstone , felsic igneous rocks ) rather than high ( mafic igneous rocks ) acid - buffering capacities .

The vertical distribution of the alteration - mineralization types in porphyry Cu deposits depends on the degree of overprinting or telescoping , the causes of which are addressed further below .
Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .

The veinlet sequence in porphyry Cu deposits , first elaborated by Gustafson and Hunt ( 1975 ) at El Salvador and widely studied since ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ; Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) , is highly distinctive .

The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits where relevant data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .

The quartz veinlets commonly cut proximal prograde exoskarn ( Einaudi , 1982 ) but do not extend into the more distal carbonate rock - hosted ore types .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers of both translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .

The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage , nearly monomineralic veinlets .

The roots of lithocaps may also contain the relatively high temperature species , andalusite and corundum ( > ~ 370ÂºC ; Hemley et al . , 1980 ) , as accompaniments to pyrophyllite and / or muscovite ( e . g . , Cabang Kiri , Indonesia , El Salvador , and Cerro Colorado ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .
The principal borosilicate mineral in lithocaps is dumortierite rather than tourmaline .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery cristobalite , alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

Any intermediate - sulfidation precious metal mineralization developed alongside the lithocaps contains much higher contents of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn than the high - sulfidation orebodies , in keeping with the situation described above from the porphyry Cu level .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .
Any carbonate rocks affected by the lithocap environment may be particularly receptive .
Each porphyry Cu epoch is closely linked to a time - equivalent magmatic event .

Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain minor volumes ( 5â10 % ) of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia ( Fig . 6 ) ; however , even major deposits can be either breccia free , as at Chuquicamata ( OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) , or breccia dominated , as exemplified by > 5 Gt of ore - grade breccia at Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco ( Warnaars et al . , 1985 ; Serrano et al . , 1996 ; Fig . 5a ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits are formed as vertically extensive bodies , which become progressively lower grade both outward and downward , whereas others have a bell - or cap - like form because little Cu was precipitated internally at depth ( e . g . , Resolution ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
Many lithocaps are vertically zoned , from the previously described quartz - pyrophyllite at depth to predominant quartz - alunite and residual quartz - the residue of extreme base leaching ( Stoffregen , 1987 ) with a vuggy appearance that reflects the original rock texture - at shallower levels where the causative fluid was cooler and , hence , more acidic ( Giggenbach , 1997 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Late porphyry Cu system evolution
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
These phreatic breccias host ore in many high - sulfidation Au Â± Ag Â± Cu deposits ( e . g . , Choquelimpie , northern Chile ; GrÃ¶pper et al . , 1991 ) .
A few deposits , instead of dying out either gradually ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) or fairly abruptly ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq , Pakistan ) at depth , have knife - sharp bases as a result of truncation by latemineral intrusions ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
These high - sulfidation assemblages commonly have higher Cu contents than the former potassic alteration , resulting in hypogene enrichment ( Brimhall , 1979 ) , although any Au may be depleted ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .

These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline or chalcedonic silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ÂºC ) of silica deposition .

These Zn - Pb - Ag Â± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As Â± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Early porphyry Cu system evolution
These pressure variations may induce changes in the fluid phases present and consequent remobilization as well as precipitation of metals ( e . g . , Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic assemblages , and sericitic alteration does the same to potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .

In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu Â± Au Â± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Where lower grade intermineral intrusions and barren lateand postmineral intrusions or diatremes are volumetrically important , the original mineralized rock volumes may be physically disrupted and ore - zone geometries radically changed and generally rendered less continuous .
Hence , pebble dikes display downward transitions to porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Tintic , Utah and Toquepala , southern Peru ; Farmin , 1934 ; Zweng and Clark , 1995 ) , whereas the breccias triggered by fluid confinement do not normally form in close proximity to intrusive bodies .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration is centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) .

Such a decrease in solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

As the thermal regimes of porphyry Cu systems decay , shallowly generated alteration - mineralization types become telescoped over more deeply formed ones ( e . g . , Gustafson , 1978 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) , thereby causing the sequence of metal remobilization and reprecipitation events emphasized above .

In any deposit cluster or alignment , the best deposit may be found first or only after several lesser discoveries have already been made ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Kirwin et al . , 2003 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag Â± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .

In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo tends to be concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2004b ) .

The only fluid present is of external origin and produces propylitic alteration similar to that in the earlier formed propylitic halos .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .

Vertical clast transport may be appreciable ( e . g . , > 1 km at Tintic ; Morris and Lovering , 1979 ) .
Although rock flour may occur between the clasts , quartz , chalcedony , alunite , barite , pyrite , and enargite are also widely observed as cementing minerals .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
Specific opaque mineral assemblages are intrinsic parts of each alteration type ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) because of the direct linkage between sulfidation state , the chief control on sulfide assemblages , and solution pH , a principal control of alteration type ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ; Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Fig . 12 ) .
Although Cu and / or Au tenors of the former potassic zones may undergo depletion during the chlorite - sericite overprints ( e . g . , Esperanza , northern Chile ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2004b ) , metal introduction is also widely recognized ( e . g . , Leach , 1999 ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) and , at a few deposits , is considered to account for much of the contained Cu ( e . g . , Cerro Colorado , northern Chile ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .

The more structurally confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and RattÃ© , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .

The same liquid continues upward into the lithocap where , upon cooling in an unbuffered environment , it evolves into a high sulfidation - state liquid ; if properly focused , it may generate high - sulfidation ( HS ) epithermal deposits .
( 7 ) if externally derived , nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?

This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems , including the overlying lithocaps .
Note that subvolcanic basement rocks host much of the porphyry Cu deposit on the left , whereas that on the right is mainly enclosed by two phases of the precursor pluton .

However , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits appear to occur exclusively in association with calcalkaline diorite and quartz diorite porphyries ( e . g . , .
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Note that shallow alteration - mineralization types consistently overprint deeper ones .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K Â± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) .
However , sericitic alteration may also constitute ore where appreciable Cu remains with the pyrite , either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( typically , pyrite - bornite , pyrite - chalcocite , pyrite - covellite , pyritetennantite , and pyrite - enargite ; Table 2 ; cf .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .

overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , effects that are accompanied by downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
However , meteoric water involvement in late sericitic alteration is by no means precluded ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , particularly on the margins of systems where the advecting magmatic liquid may entrain convecting meteoric water , although its formerly preeminent role in the porphyry Cu genetic model ( e . g . , Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Hunt , 1991 ) is now greatly diminished .
However , local structural observations , perhaps interpreted from geophysical responses , may assist in this regard , although this approach played no part in the recent discoveries noted above in the Chilean porphyry Cu districts .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .
Unusually large , laterally extensive proximal skarn bodies may form preferentially where suitable carbonate host rocks abut the tops of porphyry stocks ( e . g . , Antamina ; Redwood , 2004 ) .
Unusually large laterally extensive proximal skarn bodies may form preferentially where suitable carbonate host rocks abut the tops of porphyry stocks ( e . g . , Antamina ; Redwood , 2004 ) .
However , through - going structural ( fault and fracture network ) and hydrothermal ( phreatic breccia and vuggy , residual quartz ) permeability is probably the most critical requirement for the development of important high - sulfidation deposits ; otherwise , inadequate latestage aqueous liquids from the cooling parental magma chambers gain access to the lithocaps .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal - or Au - bearing veins and mantos .
Along with calc - alkaline batholiths and volcanic chains , they are the hallmarks of magmatic arcs constructed above active subduction zones at convergent plate margins ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ) , although a minority of such systems occupies postcollisional and other tectonic settings that develop after subduction ceases ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .

Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .
Changes in crustal stress regime are considered by some as especially favorable times for porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposit generation ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) , with Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera , Argentina , for example , both apparently occupying such a tectonic niche ( Presnell , 1997 ; Sasso and Clark , 1998 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
The entire breccia body originally underwent potassic alteration prior to partial overprinting by sericitic and , subsequently , advanced argillic assemblages , as documented by localized occurrence of remanent magnetite and muscovite after coarse - grained biotite in the cement to the sericitized breccia .

Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .

There , it condenses into ground water to oxidize and produce the low - temperature , acidic fluid responsible for the blanketlike , advanced argillic alteration zones characteristic of the steam - heated environment ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

Commonly , the highest grade most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .
Elsewhere , small - volume porphyry intrusions and the associated magmatic fluids fail to effectively penetrate low - permeability rock packages , leading to the apparently uncommon development of blind , high - grade deposits , as at Hugo Dummett in the Oyu Tolgoi district ( Kirwin et al . , 2003 and Ridgeway in the Cadia district ( Wilson et al . , 2003 ) .
Diatremes , upward - flared volcanic vents generated mainly by phreatomagmatic eruptive activity , are widespread in porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1985 ) , including their shallow , epithermal parts ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Much of the Mo in many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits occurs in the B - type veinlets , in marked contrast to the Cu dominance of the A - type generations , but D - type veinlets may also contain appreciable amounts of molybdenite in some deposits .
Addition of mafic melt to the parental chambers could be an effective means of augmenting S and metal budgets Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Maughan et al . , 2002 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Progressive disproportionation of the contained SO 2 ( to H 2 SO 4 and H 2 S ) once it and HCl ( plus any HF ) condense into ground water ( Giggenbach , 1992 ; Rye , 1993 ) generates the extremely low pH fluid responsible for the high degrees of base leaching involved in advanced argillic lithocap formation ( e . g . , Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .
Any exposed A - type quartz veinlet stockworks overprinted by sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages immediately pinpoint the spots for initial scout drilling ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

Similarly , proximal skarns lacking hydrous , retrograde overprints are unlikely to host significant Cu - Au deposits .

Clusters are broadly equidimensional groupings of deposits ( e . g . , Globe - Miami district , Arizona ; Fig . 3a ) , whereas alignments are linear deposit arrays oriented either parallel or transverse to the magmatic arcs and their coincident porphyry Cu belts .

However , in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , the Au , as small ( < 20 Âµm ) grains of high ( > 900 ) fineness native metal and in solid solution in bornite and , to a lesser degree , chalcopyrite ( e . g . , Arif and Baker , 2002 ) , and Cu are introduced together as components of centrally located potassic zones ; hence , the two metals normally correlate closely ( Sillitoe , 2000 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2004b ) .

End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
In arcs where volcanic rocks are abundant , large - volume ignimbrites , indicative of caldera formation , are taken to seriously downgrade porphyry Cu and related epithermal Au potential for the reason given above .
In contrast , D - type veinlets may be up to 1 km laterally away from the target .

Where intense chlorite - sericite or sericitic alteration overprints are developed , the reconstitution of potassic alteration may result in either reduction or complete stripping of original metal contents .

However , the erosion involved in the unroofing porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , FarallÃ³n Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .
Furthermore , textural obliteration is commonplace in the highly altered , early porphyry phases , thereby rendering them difficult to distinguish from volcanic wall rocks in some deposits ( e . g . , Galore Creek and Hugo Dummett ) .

In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .

However , the patches may also comprise alunite or kaolinite , suggesting that the texture may result by either preferential nucleation of any common advanced argillic mineral or even advanced argillic overprinting of a nucleation texture developed during earlier potassic or chlorite - sericite alteration of fragmental rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 , and Caspiche ) .

In contrast , Cu and Mo correlate less well , with spatial separation of the two metals commonly resulting from the different timing of their introduction ( e . g . , Los Pelambres ; Atkinson et al . , 1996 ) .
In contrast , Mo may be transported as different , possibly oxochloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( Ulrich and Mavrogenes , 2008 ) .
The different Mo complexing ( see above ) , probably assisted by progressive increase of the Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , results in much of the molybdenite being precipitated not only later than but also spatially separate from the bulk of the Cu Â± Au ( see above ) .

These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .

The resultant telescoping is potentially more extreme , giving rise to deep penetration of advanced argillic alteration into porphyry stocks , where porphyry Cu systems undergo either rapid , synhydrothermal erosion under high uplift , pluvial or glacial conditions ( Fig . 14 ) or , perhaps less commonly , gravity - induced sector collapse of any overlying volcanic edifices ( Sillitoe , 1994 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 1998 ; Landtwing et al . , 2002 ; Carman , 2003 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the El Indio and Yanacocha high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga and Cajamarca - Huaraz belts , respectively .

Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - CalderÃ³n and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .

For example , porphyry Cu prospects containing only weakly developed potassic alteration and A - type quartz veinlets in their central parts , indicating a deficiency of early - stage magmatic fluids , are typically subore grade .
Although many hydrothermal breccias , like the late diatremes mentioned above , are commonly diluents to ore , some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias give rise to anomalously highgrade rock volumes despite their intermineral timing .
( 10 ) why is Au transported to the distal limits of only a few porphyry Cu systems for concentration in sediment - hosted deposits , and why are most of these apparently small compared to virtually identical Carlin - type deposits ( Cline et al . , 2005 ) ?
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .

Commonly , the xenoliths are largely assimilated by the younger phases , leaving only the contained quartz veinlets , chemically more refractory than the host porphyry , as " floating " pieces ( Fig . 7 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix Â± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .

In contrast to The alteration - mineralization is zoned from advanced argillic ( with pyriteenargite ) at the top through sericitic ( with shallow pyrite and deep chalcopyrite ) to potassic ( with magnetite - chalcopyrite Â± bornite ) at the bottom , where the breccia texture may be almost imperceptible and pegmatoidal pods are commonplace .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .

In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous , retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .

Apart from the massive enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .
Apart from the massive enargite - bearing sulfide replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .
Nevertheless , the lithocap mineralization also contains greater albeit trace amounts of Bi , W , Sn , and / or Te ( e . g . , Einaudi , 1982 ) as well as appreciable Mo .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Nevertheless , resorption of any sulfide melt during ascent of oxidized magmatic fluids could make a major contribution to metal budgets ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ) .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched in Na , K , and Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .

The voluminous vapor readily separates from the coexisting hypersaline liquid and , because of its lower density , ascends buoyantly into the 1 - to 2 - km - thick rock column above the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Cooling of the hypersaline liquid in contact with external wall rocks and dilution with meteoric water in the propylitic halos may be the main causes of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn precipitation ( Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) , giving rise to the geochemical halos of these metals and , in some systems , localized vein concentrations ( Jerome , 1966 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
( 2 ) what are cross - arc lineaments , and can they be demonstrated to play a truly influential role in the localization of porphyry Cu systems ?
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps .

The sequence of alteration - mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling , from > 700Â° to < 250 Â°C , caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition .
The size of the stocks does not appear to bear any obvious relationship to the size of the associated porphyry Cu deposits and their Cu contents ( cf .
The most common hydrothermal breccias in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems are of magmatic - hydrothermal type , the products of release of overpressured magmatic FIG .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; AudÃ©tat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
On entering the lithocap environment , this intermediate sulfidation - state liquid ( forming chalcopyrite and tennantite at depth ) becomes unbuffered and easily evolves to a higher sulfidation state on cooling ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
Each individual deposit or prospect must be carefully constructed using surface mapping and core logging , with particular attention paid to the temporal as well as spatial relationships of its constituent parts .
Many features of porphyry Cu systems at all scales need to be taken into account during planning and exe - cution of base and precious metal exploration programs in magmatic arc settings .

The processes of subduction erosion and terrane accretion at convergent margins may assist with land - or trenchward migration of the arcs and contained porphyry Cu belts ( e . g . , von Huene and Scholl , 1991 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Several types of phreatic ( meteoric - hydrothermal ) breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .

The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization types become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 12 ) , with the result that the shallower alteration - mineralization zones invariably overprint and at least partly reconstitute deeper ones .
younger than the potassic zone that it overprints ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida ; OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ; Padilla - Garza et al . , 2004 ) , reflecting the time needed for the telescoping to take place .
In some systems , Mn ( Â± Ag ) is also markedly enriched in the outermost parts of the halos ( e . g . , Butte ; Meyer et al . , 1968 ) .
The recent major porphyry Cu - Mo Â± Au discoveries in the productive Collahuasi ( Rosario Oeste ) , Chuquicamata ( Toki cluster ; Rivera and Pardo , 2004 ; Fig . 3b ) , Escondida ( Pampa Escondida ) , and Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco ( Los Sulfatos ; Fig . 5a ) districts of Chile are all within < 1 to 3 km of the previously known deposits , as are the several porphyry Cu - Au discoveries in the Cadia district ( Holliday et al . , 1999 ) and high - sulfidation Au discoveries in the Yanacocha district ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) that were made since mining commenced .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .

The forms of many porphyry Cu deposits mimic those of their host intrusions ; thus , cylindrical stocks typically host cylindrical orebodies ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas laterally extensive dikes give rise to orebodies with similar narrow , elongate shapes ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
It may constitute annular zones separating the potassic cores from propylitic halos , as emphasized in early porphyry Cu models ( Jerome , 1966 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Rose , 1970 ) , but is perhaps more common as structurally controlled or apparently irregular replacements within the upper parts of chlorite - sericite and / or potassic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .

Once formed , the quartz - bearing veinlets are permanent features that are not erased during subsequent alteration overprinting , although their metal contents may be wholly or partially removed ( see above ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma convection ceases , there are marked reductions in both the heat flux and aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H .

Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor of the same composition as it cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
( 5 ) what are the deep processes that result in some porphyry Cu systems being apparently short lived while others may remain at least intermittently active for up to â¥5 m . y . ?
( 6 ) why do some porphyry Cu deposits develop large and high - grade magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , whereas others have only minor examples or none at all ?

In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .

The pro - gressive thermal decline of the systems combined with synmineral paleosurface degradation results in the char - acteristic overprinting ( telescoping ) and partial to total reconstitution of older by younger alteration - mineral - ization types .

Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .

Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization at shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .

Proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted mineralization types are obviously dependent on the presence of reactive carbonate rocks , particularly thinly bedded , silty units .
Large parts of many porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Titley , 1982 ) , especially deeply formed ( e . g . , Butte ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008a or relatively deeply eroded examples like El Abra ( Ambrus , 1977 ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) and Gaby ( Gabriela Mistral ) , northern Chile ( Camus , 2001 ( Camus , , 2003 , are made up predominantly of potassic alteration , which grades marginally into generally weakly developed propylitic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The sequence , from potassic with peripheral propylitic ( prop ) through chlorite - sericite and sericitic to advanced argillic , is the result of increasing acidity consequent upon the declining temperature of the hydrothermal fluids .
Note the absence of Cu - bearing sulfides from the early , high - temperature advanced argillic zone .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .
In addition , upward decompression and expansion of the vapor phase causes rapidly decreasing solubility of the vapor - transported metals ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ) , as confirmed by their very low contents in high - temperature but atmospheric - pressure fumaroles ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) .

Much of the metal in many porphyry Cu deposits is contained in the quartz - dominated , group 2 veinlets and as disseminated grains in the intervening potassic - altered rocks , although some of the late , group 3 quartz - sulfide veins and their wall rocks may also be important contributors .
Indeed , two or more porphyry Cu deposits may underlie some large , coalesced lithocaps ( Fig . 4 ) , which , as noted above , may have formed progressively over periods of up to several million years ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .

In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( Â± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
Elsewhere , however , lower temperature quartz - kaolinite is the dominant overprint assemblage ( e . g . , Caspiche , northern Chile ) .
Nevertheless , in some porphyry Cu deposits , these halo metals , particularly Zn , occur as late - stage veinlet arrays overprinting the Cu - dominated cores rather than peripherally ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) .
The Cu / Au ratios of lithocap - hosted , highsulfidation mineralization tend to decrease upward , with the result that most major high - sulfidation Au ( Â± Ag ) deposits occur in the shallow parts of lithocaps , commonly - but not always - with their tops immediately below the former paleowater table positions ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration event ( s ) that affect the early and intermineral porphyries and their immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric but possibly containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .

However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .

They commonly occur as tabular veins overprinting porphyry Cu deposits , like those at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) , Escondida ( Ojeda , 1986 ) , Chuquicamata ( OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ) , and Collahuasi , northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Nevertheless , in many porphyry Cu deposits , it is fluid cooling over the ~ 550Âº to 350 Â°C range , assisted by fluid - rock interaction , that is largely responsible for precipitation of the Cu , in low sulfidation - state Cu - Fe sulfide assemblages , plus any Au ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The large size of some porphyry Cu systems , with maximum radii of ~ 8 km ( e . g . , Fig . 9 ) and maximum areal extents approaching 100 km 2 ( Singer et al . , 2008 ) , complicates their effective exploration because attention is unavoidably focused on the more prominently altered parts , such as pyrite - bearing porphyry Cu mineralization , pyrite halos , and pyrite - rich lithocaps .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

At the district scale , porphyry Cu systems and their contained deposits tend to occur as clusters or alignments that may attain 5 to 30 km across or in length , respectively .
Anatomy of a telescoped porphyry Cu system showing spatial interrelationships of a centrally located porphyry Cu Â± Au Â± Mo deposit in a multiphase porphyry stock and its immediate host rocks ; peripheral proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , and sediment - hosted deposits in a carbonate unit and subepithermal veins in noncarbonate rocks ; and overlying high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits in and alongside the lithocap environment .
The legend explains the temporal sequence of rock types , with the porphyry stock predating maardiatreme emplacement , which in turn overlaps lithocap development and phreatic brecciation .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous or siliciclastic wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag Â± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - RÃ­o Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .

Locally , however , the intermediate - sulfidation and both Cor dilleran lode and shallow , disseminated high - sulfidation mineralization types display transitional mineralogic relationships , as exemplified by the so - called Main Stage veins at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) and the disseminated A and Link Au zones at Wafi - Golpu ( Leach , 1999 ; Ryan and Vigar , 1999 )
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions in early quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .

The upward - escaping , low - pressure vapor that does not attain the paleosurface as high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Hedenquist , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993 ) forms acidic condensate to produce generally barren advanced argillic alteration .

( 3 ) how important are mafic magmas in the development of the parental magma chambers beneath porphyry Cu systems , and what material contributions do they make to the systems themselves ?
There , distinction from phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias may be difficult because of texture obliteration caused by intense advanced argillic alteration ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ) .

Volumes of the different alteration types vary markedly from deposit to deposit .
In such situations , the advanced argillic alteration may be 1 to > 2 m . y .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Assessment of the likely host - rock lithologic units is also important during initial appraisals of porphyry Cu districts .
Lateral transfer of such liquids beyond lithocaps to form intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits is also dependent on the existence of suitable permeability , which in a few cases is the direct continuation of that utilized by the contiguous high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Colquijirca , Tintic ) .
( 12 ) why do only a few lithocaps appear to develop intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits on their peripheries ?
It may be speculated that crustal compression aids development of large mid - to upper - crustal magma chambers ( Takada , 1994 ) capable of efficient fractionation and magmatic fluid generation and release , especially at times of rapid uplift and erosional unroofing ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) , events which may presage initiation of stress relaxation ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; BendezÃº and FontbotÃ© , 2009 ) .
In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au Â± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .

The abovecited examples of mineralogic transitions between high - and intermediate - sulfidation mineralization provide support for this mechanism .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits , typically with above - average Cu tenors .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits above - average Cu tenors .
They are distinguished from the phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias by several features ( Table 1 ) , particularly the absence of tuffaceous material .
At several localities , the advanced argillic alteration at the bottoms of lithocaps displays a characteristic patchy texture , commonly defined by amoeboid pyrophyllite patches embedded in silicified rock ( e . g . , Escondida and Yanacocha ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ) .
in the case of long - lived porphyry Cu systems , whereas elsewhere the loci of intrusive and hydrothermal activity migrate , either systematically or randomly , to give rise to the porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposit clusters and alignments discussed above .
By the time that the late - mineral porphyry phases are added to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , fluid ascent from the parental magma chambers has all but ceased , and K and metal availability is too limited to generate appreciable potassic alteration and mineralization .
The existence of even minor erosional remnants of steam - heated horizons and their chalcedonic bases , generated above and at paleowater tables , respectively , guarantees that the appropriate near - surface level is preserved ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Simplified sections through high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits to illustrate the wide variation in alteration zoning patterns and their relationship to porphyry intrusions and Cu tenor .
The immediately premineral , early porphyries and their contiguous host rocks contain the highest grade mineralization in most deposits although , exceptionally , the earliest phase can be poorly mineralized ( e . g . , Grasberg ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ) .

The main development of these bornite - , chalcocite - , and covellite - bearing , high - sulfidation assemblages is largely confined to white sericitic alteration that overprints now - barren quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .

However , if the overprinted high - sulfidation assemblages also contain appreciable arsenical sulfosalts , a situation that becomes increasingly likely upward in most systems , the resultant mineralization is less desirable because it is not only refractory if subjected to bacterial heap leaching but also generates As - rich flotation concentrates that may prove difficult to market .

Spatial relationships between porphyry Cu stocks , underlying pluton , overlying comagmatic volcanic rocks , and the lithocap .
The deeper , central cores of porphyry Cu systems are occupied by porphyry Cu deposits , in which ore - zone geometries depend mainly on the overall form of the host stock or dike complex , the depositional sites of the Cu - bearing sulfides , and the positions of any late , low - and subore - grade porphyry intrusions and diatremes .

Coalescence of closely spaced porphyry Cu deposits enhances size potential ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2008 ) Development of wall rock - hosted orebodies alongside porphyry Cu deposits is most common where receptive carbonate rocks are present ( Fig . 6 ) .
Deposit types include proximal Cu Â± Au and , less commonly , distal Au and / or Zn - Pb skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag Â± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .

A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al .

Whether or not these and other deposit clusters and alignments owe their existence to fundamental faults or lineaments ( see above ; Richards , 2000 ) , it is often not obvious if exploration - commonly focused on areas of pre - or postmineral cover - should target broadly equidimensional deposit arrays or arc - parallel or arc - transverse alignments , particularly when only one or two deposits have been defined .
Notwithstanding the ubiquity of porphyry Cu belts , major deposits may also occur in isolation or at least as distant outliers of coherent belts and provinces ( e . g . , Pebble in Alaska , Butte in Montana , and Bingham in Utah ; Sillitoe , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) .
This situation implies that the underlying parental plutons have protracted life spans , albeit intermittent in some cases , with porphyry Cu formation taking place above them at different places over time .
Light stable isotope studies of sodic - calcic alteration in the Yerington district support the involvement of externally derived brine from the host sedimentary sequence , although the albite - actinolite alteration there is magnetite destructive ( Carten , 1986 ; .

If this scenario is correct , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity ( 5â20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350Â° to 250 Â°C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Therefore , recognition of even weakly developed mineralization of a single type may help to direct exploration for potentially higher grade mineralization of other types elsewhere in the system .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .

The A - type veinlets range from stockworks to subparallel , sheeted arrays , the latter particularly common in Au - rich porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
There is a strong suggestion that comagmatic volcanism may be inhibited in some major porphyry Cu belts as a result of their characteristic contractional tectonic settings , as in the FIG .
Mining and deep drilling in a few large porphyry Cu deposits show that mineralized intrusions have vertical extents of > 2 km ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida , northern Chile , and Grasberg ) and , based on evidence from the steeply tilted systems , perhaps â¥4 km ( Dilles , 1987 ; Seedorff et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity of veining , alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .

However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite Â± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .

However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large , albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .
However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .
This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature , pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
Where steeply dipping , receptive carbonate rock sequences abut steep porphyry stock contacts , vertically extensive proximal skarn bodies may form ( e . g . , the > 1 , 600 - m extent of the Ertsberg East ( Gunung Bijih ) Cu - Au deposit , Indonesia ; Coutts et al . , 1999 ) .
In a minority of cases , however , diatremes ( e . g . , Grasberg , Galore Creek , and Boyongan - Bayugo , Philippines ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Enns et al . , 1995 ; Braxton et al . , 2008 ) or tuff - filled depressions presumably fed by one or more subjacent diatremes ( e . g . , Resolution ) are early features that act as receptive wall rocks to the main alteration and mineralization .
At the early stage ( left side ) , magma is present at the top of the parental chamber , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid exits the magma and undergoes phase separation during ascent to generate immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor , which generate potassic alteration plus contained low sulfidation - state porphyry Cu Â± Au mineralization .

The empirical relationship between well - established magmatic ( including postcollisional ) arcs containing major , highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits and contractional tectonic settings characterized by high surface uplift and denudation rates ( see above ) may prove to be a useful criterion for selection of underexplored arc segments with incompletely tested potential . Contractional settings are strongly suggested where entire arc segments possess only minor volcanic rock volumes contemporaneous with the development of porphyry Cu systems , particularly where lithocaps are widely preserved as evidence for shallow erosion .
The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size , grade , and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems .
The clustering or alignment of both porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits has been shown time and again to be a highly effective exploration concept .
Nevertheless , it also characterizes the centrally located zones of some porphyry Cu stocks ( e . g . , Koloula , Solomon Islands and Island Copper , British Columbia ; Chivas , 1978 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 1995 ; Arancibia and Clark , 1996 ) .
The alteration - mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren , early sodic - calcic through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic , to advanced argillic , the last of these constituting the lithocaps , which may attain > 1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion .
They span a range of compositions from calc - alkaline diorite and quartz diorite through granodiorite to quartz monzonite ( monzogranite ) , and alkaline diorite through monzonite to , uncommonly , syenite ( e . g . , Galore Creek , British Columbia ; Enns et al . , 1995 ) .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au , skarn Cu Â± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts with less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .

It also needs to be emphasized that few porphyry Cu systems , whatever their exposure level , contain the full spectrum of potential ore types depicted in Figure 6 , although the Bingham district with its porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and sediment - hosted Au deposits ( Babcock et al . , 1995 ) and the more shallowly exposed Lepanto district with its porphyry Cu - Au , high - sulfidation Cu - Au - Ag , and intermediate - sulfidation Au - Ag - Cu deposits ( Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) are exceptionally well endowed in this regard .

Varied relationships are observed between porphyry Cu systems and precursor plutons , which are typically multiphase , equigranular intrusions , commonly of batholithic dimensions and dioritic to granitic compositions ; they are not only spatially , but also temporally and probably genetically related to porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au formation ( Fig . 4 ) .
At the deposit scale , particularly in the por - phyry Cu environment , early - formed features commonly , but by no means always , give rise to the best ore - bodies .

The main geochemical difference between the Cu - Au zones in porphyry Cu deposits and those in the overlying lithocaps is the elevated As ( Â± Sb ) contents consequent upon the abundance of the Cu sulfosalts in the latter .
Current orthodoxy maintains that the early sodic - calcic alteration observed in some porphyry Cu deposits is a product of inflowing brine sourced from host - rock sequences ( Carten , 1986 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005Seedorff et al . , , 2008 , in keeping with theoretical predictions for fluids following heating paths under silicate - rockâbuffered conditions ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1984Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Under these lower temperature conditions , sericitic Â± chlorite - sericite alteration zones begin to form from a deeply derived , single - phase aqueous liquid generated by one or both of the methods ( see text ) postulated by and Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) .

The fluid most likely to lead to appreciable high - sulfidation Au Â± Ag Â± Cu mineralization in the relatively barren , earlyformed lithocaps is the low - to moderate - salinity , H 2 S - rich , aqueous liquid that produces the underlying sericitic zones Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Fig . 14 ) .

See text for further details and Table 2 for alteration - mineralization details .
Where telescoping is limited , however , the lithocaps and potassic - altered porphyry stocks may be separated by 0 . 5 to 1 km ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , a gap typically occupied by pyritic chlorite - sericite alteration ( Fig . 11 ) .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .

In the more highly telescoped systems , where sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages overprint appreciable volumes of potassic and / or chlorite - sericite alteration within porphyry intrusions , the ensuing effects can be varied .
These transverse features , possibly reflecting underlying basement structures , may facilitate ascent of the relatively small magma volumes involved in porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , Clark , 1993 ; Richards , 2000 ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich , Mopoor porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .

( 11 ) what is the fluid regime responsible for metal zoning in lithocaps , and why are so many lithocaps apparently barren ?
Open - space filling is also uncommon , except in phreatic breccias and unusual , isolated veins ( e . g . , La Mejicana alunite - pyrite - famatinite vein at Nevados del Famatina ; Lozada - CalderÃ³n and McPhail , 1996 ) .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , exploration should focus first around their peripheries in case a porphyry Cu deposit has already been exposed .
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles are dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .

The same situation is also apparent in several giant high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits generated in thickened crust during tectonic uplift , such as Pascua - Lama and Veladero , northern Chile - Argentina , where the near absence of contemporaneous volcanism is more certain ( Bissig et al . , 2001 ; CharchafliÃ© et al . , 2007 ) given the much shallower erosion level , including partial paleosurface preservation ( see below ) .

Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias display a variety of textures ( Table 1 ) , which are mainly dependent on clast form and composition , clast / matrix ratio , matrix / cement constitution , and alteration type .
Therefore recognition of A - and B - type veinlets in sericitic or advanced argillic zones testifies unambiguously to the former presence of potassic alteration .
Note scale difference between c and a , b , and d . The precursor plutons are considered as the mid - to uppercrustal crystallization sites of mafic to felsic magmas that ascended from deeper reservoirs before porphyry Cu systems were developed ( see Richards , 2003 ) .
( 9 ) what are the main mechanisms controlling the bulk Cu / Au / Mo ratios of porphyry Cu deposits ?
At first glance , using representative cross sections of alteration at four highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits as examples ( Fig . 15 ) , these varied geometries are not easy to relate to a standard geologic model .
Note the common absence of B - and D - type veinlets from Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks and M - , magnetite - bearing A - , and chlorite - rich veinlets from Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Renewed neutralization of this same liquid on exiting the lithocap and / or aliquots of the deep liquid that bypass the lithocap entirely may give rise to peripheral intermediate - sulfidation ( IS ) epithermal mineralization .
As a consequence , the most distal and subtle ore types , sediment - hosted Au on the fringes of carbonate rockhosted districts and Zn - Pb - Ag Â± Auâbearing intermediatesulfidation epithermal veins and carbonate - replacement bodies on the fringes of lithocaps attract less attention and may be easily missed .
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that certain lithologic units may enhance grade development in both porphyry Cu and related deposit types .
The early , intermineral , and late - mineral phases of the porphyry Cu stocks , which span the interval during which the porphyry Cu deposits formed , originate from increasingly greater depths in the progressively crystallizing parental chamber .
The degree of overprinting is perhaps best appreciated in some magmatichydro thermal breccia bodies in which isolated magnetite aggregates occur as stranded remnants in sericitic or chloritesericite zones up to 1 km above the magnetite - cemented , potassic parts ( e . g . , Chimborazo , northern Chile ; Fig . 8 ) .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high temperatures and oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .

Nevertheless , several temporally discrete porphyry Cu - bearing arcs may be superimposed on PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS 5 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 A preeminent example of spatial and temporal coincidence between a porphyry Cu belt and an intra - arc fault zone : the northern Chile part of the central Andean middle Eocene to early Oligocene porphyry Cu belt and Domeyko fault system ( summarized from Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit , northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planÃ¨ze ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planÃ¨ze ) .
Furthermore , there seems to be no obvious relationship between the size of porphyry Cu deposits and the duration of the intrusive activity , the latter seemingly being the main parameter defining the total hydrothermal life spans of porphyry Cu systems .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .

Isotopic dating , using the U - Pb zircon method , suggests that the multiphase porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu systems can be assembled in as little as 80 , 000 years ( Batu Hijau , Indonesia ; Garwin , 2002 ) , but the process commonly takes much longer .
It is unlikely coincidental that at least half the ore at three of the highest grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits is hosted by such rocks : a gabbro - diabase - basalt complex at El Teniente ( Skewes et al . , 2002 ) , a Proterozoic diabase sill complex at Resolution , Arizona ( Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) , and a tholeiitic basalt sequence in the Oyu Tolgoi district .

Arranged from probable oldest ( top ) to youngest ( bottom ) , except for propylitic that is lateral equivalent of potassic ; advanced argillic also forms above potassic early in systems ( Fig . 10 ) 3 Many veinlets in potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alteration contain anhydrite , which also occurs as late , largely monomineralic veinlets particularly , advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2002 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ) .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large , high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and PerellÃ³ , 2005 ; PerellÃ³ , 2006 ) .

However , at the shallower depths typical of most deposits ( < ~ 4 km ) , the mineralization is introduced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction of hypersaline liquid ( brine ) and a much larger volume of lowdensity vapor ( Fournier , 1999 ) , produced by either direct exsolution from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more typically , as the single - phase liquid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Cline , 1995 ) .

And these geologic observations must further emphasize the relative timing of intrusion , brecciation , alteration , and mineralization events because isotopic dating techniques do not and may never have the required resolution .

Some investigators emphasize the importance of intersections between continentscale transverse fault zones or lineaments and arc - parallel structures for porphyry Cu formation , with the Archibarca and Calama - El Toro lineaments of northern Chile ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 2 ) , the Lachlan Transverse Zone of New South Wales ( Glen and Walshe , 1999 ) , comparable features in New Guinea ( Corbett , 1994 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , and the much wider ( 160 km ) Texas lineament of southwestern North America ( Schmitt , 1966 ) being oft - quoted examples .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .

However , USTs are not consistently developed and , hence , do not provide a reliable means of subdividing porphyry Cu intrusion phases .

However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Irrespective of whether the porphyry Cu systems and contained deposits define clusters or alignments , their surface distributions are taken to reflect the areal extents of either underlying parental plutons or cupolas on their roofs .
range from restricted veneers near the stock or dike contacts to kilometer - scale zones , such as those in the mafic host lithologic units mentioned previously at El Teniente , Resolution , and Oyu Tolgoi .
But more fundamentally , however , we require better and more detailed documentation of geologic relationships in porphyry Cu systems worldwide , at all scales from the thin section to the entire system , and with greater emphasis on the regional to district context , particularly the relationship to igneous evolution .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .

The Bingham , Island Copper , and Agua Rica , Argentina , porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are exceptions to this generalization because of their deep , centrally located molybdenite zones ( John , 1978 ; PerellÃ³ et al . , 1995PerellÃ³ et al . , , 1998 .
Nevertheless , many systems contain only one or two deposit types rather than a full zonal array ( Table 3 ) , with the presence of the more distal ore types at either porphyry Cu or lithocap levels being independent of the size and grade of the porphyry Cu deposits or prospects .
Notwithstanding the typical occurrence model depicted in Figure 6 and taking into account the critical importance of erosion level , the innumerable variations on the porphyry Cu genetic theme result in a broad spectrum of three - dimensional intrusion , breccia , alteration , and mineralization geometries ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
It is acquisition of this geologic detail that is going to enable better application of laboratory techniques and , hopefully , further clarify the localization and evolutionary histories of porphyry Cu systems as well as the fundamental controls on large size and high hypogene grade .
For example , the 12 . 5 - Gt resource at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic is confined to the 14 - km - long stock referred to above ( OssandÃ³n et al . , 2001 ; Camus , 2003 ) , whereas perhaps only roughly 20 percent of the similarly sized El Teniente deposit and < 10 percent of the 1 . 5 - Gt El Abra deposit are hosted by the porphyry intrusions ( Camus , 1975 ( Camus , , 2003Ambrus , 1977 ) .

Magma generation in convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Most magmas erupted through the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ÎFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 Â°C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 Â°C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .

Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .

Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 are high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

At R - factors below ~ 10 2 , magmas will be depleted in both Cu and Au .
At Rfactors N10 5 , magmas will be undepleted in Au and Cu ( porphyry Cu - Au - potential magmas ) .
In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( AudÃ©tat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive Î´ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Ti , Nb , and Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 Â°C .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .
The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , ÄernÃ½ et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .
Such magmas may remobilize Au as well as Cu Â± Mo left behind in residual sulfide phases by arc magmatism , leading to the potential formation of porphyry Cu Â± Au Â± Mo and alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits .

the Sn could have been extracted from the crustally - derived granites .
The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions of arc magmatism , sulfur will be dominantly present as sulfate and sulfate , but saturation in small amounts of sulfide phases is also likely .

Such magmas have the potential to form porphyry Cu Â± Mo deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .
This lithosphere will have undergone significant modification during the previous subduction cycle , most importantly with the introduction of large volumes of hydrous , mafic ( amphibolitic ) cumulates residual from lower crustal differentiation of arc basalts .

This process occurs most efficiently at depths greater than ~ 6 km , within large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes fed by arc or post - subduction magmas .

Such arc basalts are distinguished from MORB by higher contents of incompatible elements ( as noted above ) and water ( up to 6 wt . % H 2 O ; Cervantes and Wallace , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ) .

These trace element characteristics are therefore an indicator of high magmatic water content rather than being a source signature , and this likely explains the common association of high - Sr / Y ( i . e . , hydrous ) magmas with magmatic - hydrothermal ore depositswithout magmatic water , such deposits cannot form .

These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .

Such magmatic - metallogenic systems are thought to form by remelting of previously subductionmodified upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate roots of former arc magmatic complexes .
These fluid - mobile components are also characteristically enriched in arc magmas ( e . g . , typical ranges of : 1 - 3 wt . % H 2 O , 500 - 2000 ppm Cl , 900 - 2500 ppm S ; Davidson , 1996 ; Gill , 1981 ; Noll et al . , 1996 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) , which is taken as evidence of aqueous fluid metasomatism of the mantle wedge magma source .

At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .

These granites tend to be enriched in lithophile rather than chalcophile elements , reflecting their crustal origins , and may generate magmatic - hydrothermal deposits containing Sn , W , U , Mo , REE , Li , Be , B , and F .

These high observed metal solubilities are consistent with or exceed experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on chloride complexing alone ( e . g . , Holland , 1984 , 1986 ) , and suggest that other volatile ligands such as sulfide species may enhance the solubility of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in high temperature aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz et al . , 2008Zajacz et al . , , 2011 .

Thus , mineralization may only occur where later moderate salinity liquids have followed a higher pressure , rather specialized cooling path , as described above ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ) .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( Â± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the RoÅia MontanÄ , Skouries , Kisladag , ÃÃ¶pler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .
Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

In more oxidized subduction - related or post - subduction magmas , although sulfide saturation likely occurs at some point during their evolution ( as indicated by the common presence of sparse sulfide inclusions in phenocrysts in arc volcanic rocks as well as lower crustal arc cumulates ; e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ; Halter et al . , 2002 ; Hattori , 1997 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Fig . 5 ) , it may not occur to the extent that sulfides physically separate from the magma , or at least not in large amounts .

However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu Â± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10Ã higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

In post - subduction tectonic settings Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting , a subducting slab source no longer exists , and magmas are predominantly derived from partial melting of the upper plate lithosphere .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Finally , partial melting of predominantly reduced , sulfide - rich crustal rocks in orogenic settings may lead to chalcophile and siderophile element - depleted , but potentially lithophile element - rich S - type magmas ( see Section 2 . 6 ) .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .
Behavior of metals
Behavior of metals
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , WÃ¶rner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .

In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .

Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( Â± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , JÃ©go et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .

Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .

The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Consequently , the bulk of Cu - sulfide mineralization occurs at the low - temperature , late - stage end of the potassic alteration phase , just prior to the onset of phyllic alteration ( i . e . , corresponding to the " ore shell " of the classic Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 , porphyry Cu model ) .
Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; MÃ¼ller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .
Also shown are the wet granite and granodiorite solidi ( Burnham , 1979 ) , and average crustal ( 30 Â°C / km ) and high ( 300 Â°C / km , near active volcanism ) geothermal gradients ( Barbier , 2002 ; Goff et al . , 1992 ; Noorollahi et al . , 2007 ) .

Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

In particular , the cosmogenic radioisotope 10 Be can be used as a tracer of recent ( b10 Ma ) introduction of sediments into arc magma sources ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Morris et al . , 1990 ) .
Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ÎFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .
When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
With the exception of porphyry Sn - W deposits that are associated with crustally derived S - type granites , most other deposits in this grouping are formed by calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline I - type granitoids directly or indirectly related to subduction .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400Â°to 300 Â°C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 Â°C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O â H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : Ã°1Ã This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600Â°and 800 Â°C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

The question of whether the downgoing oceanic slab , or more specifically the basaltic oceanic crust , melts during subduction has prompted lively debate recently , not only in the petrology literature ( e . g . , Conrey , 2002 ; Kepezhinskas , 2001 , 2002 ; Garrison and Davidson , 2003 ) , but also amongst economic geologists because of the suggestion that " slab melts " might in some way be uniquely fertile for later porphyry ore formation ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Oyarzun et al . , , 2002Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; ThiÃ©blemont et al . , 1997 ; for contrary opinions , see : Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition of Cu and Mo Â± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; MÃ¼ntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( AudÃ©tat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( AudÃ©tat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene ÃÃ¶pler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the RoÅia MontanÄ epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; FontbotÃ© et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .
As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu Â± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 Â°C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425Â° - 320 Â°C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( â¤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

As discussed in Sections 2 . 1 . 1 and 2 . 5 . 1 , chalcophile and siderophile elements partition strongly into sulfide phases exsolving or crystallizing from silicate melts .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425Â° - 320 Â°C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .

Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .
These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3Ã ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .
( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed a similar model for giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposits in the southwestern USA .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu Â± Mo Â± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( AudÃ©tat and Pettke , 2003 ; AudÃ©tat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 Â°C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .
Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400Â° - 500 Â°C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant Bingham , Butte , Climax , Henderson , and Questa porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .

Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .
Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400Â° - 500 Â°C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .

Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400Â° - 350 Â°C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 Â°C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 Â°C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( â¥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths â¥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .
In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .

Porphyry deposits supply most of the world ' s Cu and Mo resources .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .

Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .

Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide silicate melts .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2â ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2â ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
Copper , Mo and Au act as incompatible elements in sulfide undersaturated magmas , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently , driving the oxidation potential of sulfate up to the hematite - magnetite oxygen fugacity ( HM ) buffer , which is ~ ÎFMQ + 4 .
Degassing of oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .
Degassing oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .
Sulfide formed during sulfate reduction is efficiently scavenged by aqueous fluids , which transports metals to shallower depths , i . e . , the top of the porphyry and superjacent wallrock .
Sulfate reduction and ferrous Fe oxidation form H + , which dramatically lowers the pH values of ore - forming fluids and causes pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits .

Porphyry deposits are hosts to one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , accounting for ~ 80 % Cu and ~ 95 % Mo of the world ' s total reserves .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Oxygen fugacity is of critical importance for the behaviors of elements .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .

Porphyry Cu and Au deposits almost do have systematically higher FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
Sulfates , including anhydrite and alunite ( likely related to the epithermal mineralization ) are abundant in the mineralization system , and hematite formed during chlorite alteration , indicating high oxygen fugacity up to the HM buffer ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Porphyry Au deposits have oxygen fugacities similar to , if not higher than , porphyry Cu deposits .
El Teniente is a nested porphyry system that , according to different authors , was active for ~ 1 Ma ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Cannell et al . , 2003 ) up to more than 7 Ma ( 14 . 2 - 6 . 5 Ma ) ( Barra , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2011 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .

Chuquicamata is another supergiant porphyry deposit in Chile , with a total reserve of ~ 106 Mt Cu @ 0 . 71 % , 1 . 81 Mt Mo @ 0 . 024 % and 301 t Au @ 0 . 04 g / t ( Table 1 .

Gangue minerals include quartz , muscovite , chlorite , calcite , minor epidote and anhydrite .
Hematite is also found in fluid inclusions in Dexing ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) .
Adakites found in the Qulong deposit are mixtures of continental and slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating shows that the formation ages of deposits within the Yulong ore belt range from 41 . 2 to 36 . 9 Ma , extending over a period of similar to 4 . 3 Ma , with formation ages decreasing systematically from northwest to southeast ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .
Zircon grains from the Yulong ore - bearing porphyries have higher Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + values than those from barren porphyries in the region ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .

Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , the behaviors of which are mainly controlled by reduced sulfur , e . g . , sulfide , hydrosulfide complexes ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or polysulfide ( e . g . , S 2 2â , S 3 â ) complexes ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Sulfur oxidation , sulfide under saturation and residual sulfide
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 Â± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Partial melting mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts formed at oxygen fugacities higher than ÎFMQ + 2 are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ÎFMQ + 1 . 7 and ÎFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Slab melts formed at ÎFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ÎFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ÎFMQ 0 ) .
Sulfate reduction
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation during magma chamber development may be better mixed and more homogenized .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ÎFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

Hydrogen may further react with CO 2 and / or O 2 ( Eqs .
Pure hydrothermal hematite and specularite can often be determined to have formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , the specularite occurring in late stage veins at Dexing ( Fig . 13 ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .

Reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are : 17 Mile Hill , Western Australia ; the MinÃ£s de San Anton , Mexico ( Rowins , 2000 ) ; the Baogutu , northwestern China ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010aShen et al . , , 2012 ; North Fork Deposit , west Central Cascades , western North America ( Smithson and Rowins , 2005 ) ; Catface ; Vancouver Island , British Columbia ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; and a few other small porphyry deposits ( Rowins , 2000 ) .

Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Ridge subduction forms oxidized adakites by slab melting ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Ling et al . , 2009Ling et al . , , 2013 , followed by reduced A - type granites ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; H . Li et al . , 2012 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1994 ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Low - salinity vapor shows strong seawater signals , which cannot represent " degassing " fluids .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .
Oxidized Mt Washington adakite was emplaced at 41 - 35 . 3 Ma during the subduction of the west limb of the ridge , bringing more ore forming fluids into the Catface porphyry .

At oxygen fugacities of ÎFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The H isotopes of fluid inclusions from Baogutu have very low Î´D values ( Shen et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , which are much lower than for either magmatic fluids or metamorphic fluids ( Fig . 21 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The systematically lighter H coupled with a slightly lighter O can best be explained by the addition of meteoritic water .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The total iron ( expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) content ranges from 2 . 25 wt . % to 5 . 53 wt . % for the Catface porphyry .
One carbon atom reduces 4 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .

The mantle derived parent magmas of the Catface porphyry are expected to have been more reduced ( near the FMQ oxygen fugacity buffer ) and drier than the adakite , and to have a lower initial Cu contents .
The Baogutu adakites have been attributed to the mixing of ~ 95 % slab melt with 5 % sediment - derived melt in the Late Carboniferous close to a subducting spreading ridge ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) .

This immiscibility implies that water is stable in the mantle under high pressure ( Bali et al . , 2013 ) .

HDP = hornblende diorite porphyry ; GDP = Granodiorite porphyry ; D = diorite .
Many epithermal deposits , however , are not linked to porphyry deposits .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma that is saturated with S - and metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

These igneous anhydrite grains with planar crystal boundaries , occur along with fresh and unaltered biotite , feldspars , quartz , and Fe - oxides ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
These anhydrite occurrences indicate that the Qulong magmatic - hydrothermal system was highly oxidized and sulfur - rich , with abundant sulfates ( Xiao et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 14 ) .

During mantle melting , Cu as well as Au and Mo are all moderately incompatible elements , with partition coefficients ranging between those of Yb and Ce ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003aSun et al . , , b , 2004a .
During metamorphism subducting slab , S is mobile from metamorphic rocks ranging in grade from blueschist to amphibolite ( Sun et al . , 2013a ; Tomkins , 2010 ) , such that they can release S and chalcophile elements to the mantle wedge ( J . L .
How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
If the magma at Catface was reduced during degassing of SO 3 , there should be compositional zonation in the apatite , which is not the case ( Fig . 20 ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Normal arc melts are not systematically more enriched in Cu than MORB , either ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .

( 3 ) Is sulfide saturation during magma evolution important for porphyry mineralization ?
( 11 ) , degassing SO 2 indeed consumes oxygen , such that it may lower the oxygen fugacity of the system .

Given that ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization , the highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic high potassium intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .

Thus , the magma chamber would need to be unrealistically thick , e . g . , thicker than the continental crust .
Moreover , degassing of any type is not likely to be a key process during porphyry mineralization , which is usually occurring at depths of 2 - 4 km ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

Instead of primary hematite , magnetite , and sulfate ( e . g . , anhydrite , gypsum ) that are frequently seen in oxidized porphyries , these " reduced " porphyry Cu - Au deposits contain abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and commonly have carbonic - rich ore fluids with substantial proportions of CH 4 , clearly indicating a reducing condition ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Most of the ferric Fe will be transferred into the melt because ferric Fe is more incompatible than ferrous Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .

Most of the sulfur magmas is present as sulfate at oxygen fugacities higher than ÎFMQ + 2 .
Meanwhile , sulï¬de is kept undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized magmas , such that no sulï¬de segregation is expected ( Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , Cu , Mo and Au act as moderately incompatible ele - ments ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , which become enriched during the early stage of magma evolution , and suddenly go into magmatic ï¬uids during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013a ) .
Therefore , residual sulï¬des are more efï¬ciently destroyed at oxygen fugacities higher than FMQ + 2 , releasing their chalcophile elements ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Because the anhydrite - rich stock is isotopically similar to all the other igneous rocks of the late Miocene deposit ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) formed at a time of regional compressive deformation , it has been proposed that an oxidized parent magma in the large productive magma chamber was undergoing igneous fractionation at that time .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ÎFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content at sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ÎFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .

Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .

Meanwhile , sulfide is kept undersaturated during the evolution of the oxidized magma , such that no sulfide segregation occurs , and Cu , Mo , and Au act as moderately incompatible elements .
Therefore , the crystallization of magnetite and hematite tends to lower the proportions of ferric iron in the magma , which apparently would lower the oxygen fugacity .

Most of the hematite and / or specularite formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The further oxidation of magnetite is controlled by the pH values of the system ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , S 3 â may indeed cause more fluctuations in oxygen fugacities through a different reaction pathway , but it has no major influences on the final results ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It contains native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Meanwhile , Cu may be transported to distal sites through normal fluids .
Formation of reduced porphyry deposits
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .

Most of the hydrogen and methane should have been oxidized by ferric Fe .
In general , porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have FeO contents systematically lower than porphyry Cu , but higher than pure porphyry Mo deposits , with oxygen fugacities also falling between them ( Fig . 8 ) .
Mainly , the sulfur speciation in magmas is controlled by oxygen fugacity .

Evidence for reduced magma in the Baogutu porphyry deposit
Then , how do reduced magmas get enriched in Cu ?
For example , graphite and diamond are stable in the deep mantle .
However , at oxygen fugacities higher than ÎFMQ + 2 , ~ 5 - 10 % of partial melting is enough to eliminate residual sulfide from the subducted oceanic crust , forming adakitic melts with high Cu S contents up to 2000 ppm and percent levels , respectively .
Most of these ridges , however , are older than 100 Ma ( W . D .
Most of these ridges , however , are older 100 Ma ( W . D .
Therefore , ÎFMQ + 2 is often considered the magic number for porphyry mineralization .
The amount of H + released during mineralization and the alkali content in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alterations .

The amount of H + released during mineralization and the alkali content in the porphyry together control the intensity of alterations .
For example , Cenozoic porphyry deposits located in island arcs in the southwestern Pacific are all Cu - Au deposits , e . g . , Grasberg and Batu Hijau in Indonesia ; Panguna and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea ; Lepanto - Far South East , Tampakan , Atlas and Sipilay in the Philippines ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .

The supergiant El Teniente deposit in Chile is the largest porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit in the world , with total reserves of ~ 109 Mt Cu @0 . 92 % , 2 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 02 % and 437 t Au @0 . 035 g / t ( Table 1 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
The estimated Cu abundance in the primitive mantle is 30 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , whereas the Cu concentrations in MORB so far published range from 70 to 150 ppm ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) .
In contrast , metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require low oxygen fugacity for their stabilization during the final stage of mineralization .
In contrast , sulfate reduction in magmas does not change the pH , such that the oxygen fugacity is slightly reduced .
In contrast , sulfate reduction in magmas does not change the pH , such that the oxygen fugacity reduced .
For example , ilmenite is an end - member of the hematite - ilmenite solid solutions with a very low hematite component , varying from X Hem ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 ) , for the Catface phase and X Hem ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 09 ) for the Hecate Bay phase ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
In addition , degassing cannot explain the decoupling between Î´D and O isotope compositions .
In addition , degassing cannot explain the decoupling between Î´D and O isotope compositions .
In contrast , reduced magmas usually retain residual sulfides , such that they have low primary Cu contents ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
First , lower Cu and Au contents would first result in lower grade , not necessarily smaller tonnages .
The grades of porphyry Cu and Au deposits associated with reduced magmas are comparable to , if not higher than , those associated with oxidized magmas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rowins , 2000 ) .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .
We infer that large proportions of these adakites are still buried due to the dramatically lessened compression , uplifting and erosion following ridge subduction .
We infer that large proportions adakites are still buried due to the dramatically lessened compression , uplifting and erosion following ridge subduction .
For example , epithermal deposits formed in the mid ocean ridge and backarc basins usually do not have any associated porphyry deposit .
In addition , compression also results in uplifting and erosions , which are later favorable for the exposure of porphyry deposits .
In addition , compression also results in uplifting and erosions , which are later favorable for the exposure porphyry deposits .
In contrast , oceanic crust has sulfur abundances of over 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , which is about 4 times greater than the primitive mantle value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) .
The amount of H + released during mineralization ( e . g . , Eqs .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

Nevertheless , porphyry deposits are usually mineralized in the whole upper portion of the pluton , whereas interactions with country rocks are generally restricted at the interface , therefore assimilation of reducing sediments is not likely to be a decisive controlling process .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .

Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .
Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Nevertheless , assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries would result in heterogeneous reduction , because reduction is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .

Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
In fact , most Cu should have come from slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , as also should have come the S and Pb , which are present in abundances similar to mantle derived magmas .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Therefore , the parental Catface magmas may have acquired a low fO 2 during their ascent through the crust .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Moreover , most mantle minerals olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Moreover , the crystallization of amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
There are also several ridges ( most of which are aseismic , i . e . , island chains ) on the western Pacific plate ( Fig . 28 ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .

Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large Cu .
Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulï¬de , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .

Moreover , some porphyry deposits are apparently associated with reduced magmas at ÎFMQ â 0 . 5 to â 3 ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Intergrowths of hematite and magnetite ( Fig . 10 ) indicate the oxygen fugacity of Qulong reached the HM buffer .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ÎFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
In contrast , at oxygen fugacity even only slightly lower , e . g . , ÎFMQ + 1 . 7 , the highest Cu contents that can be reached through slab melting is ~ 450 ppm .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Therefore , the reduced Catface porphyry is likely to be a country rock that only hosts the deposit .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .

Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
Considering the geotherm ' s concave downward shape of subducting slabs , ridge subduction is the most favorable tectonic setting for slab melting in the Phanerozoic .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .

Shapinggou . The Shapinggou porphyry Mo deposit is the largest
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
When there is no residual sulfide in the mantle source , Cu and also other chalcophile elements become highly incompatible ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce Î´D of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .
There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .

Also shown is the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , thick horizontal orange line ; NNO and FMQ , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .

( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
In contrast , the oceanic plates subducting underneath the western North American continent are younger and have experienced only one Ocean Anoxic Event .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains the Au - rich capping feature of many reduced porphyry deposits .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Intrusions in the Vancouver Island range in age from 51 to 35 . 5 Ma ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , spanning the time during which the Kula - Farallon ridge collided with the continent .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .

There are several subducting ridges along the east Pacific margin , e . g . , in Chile and Peru in the South America .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin - Mariana , and other arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ÎFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .

In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with reduced magmas
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is followed by emplacement the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .

Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .

It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

Evidence for reduced magmas of Catface porphyry deposit
The formation of the Catface porphyry deposit
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .

There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
Experiments show that sulfate is much more soluble than sulfide in magmas .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
More accurately , the ferrous Fe in fluids reacts with water , releasing H 2 and H + ( Eq .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bÎFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ÎFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
This implies that such porphyry deposits themselves are not genetically related to reduced magmas , i . e . , they are not the causative magma , but the host rock .
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .

This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .

Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulï¬de .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .

The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .

Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration .

Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
They are associated with carbonic - rich ore forming fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , and multiple intrusive events ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 â¥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 â¥ 15 wt . % , Y â¤ 18 ppm , Yb â¤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr â¥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The question is again why normal arc rocks in compressed environments do not form porphyry deposits .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ÎFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayaliteâmagnetiteâ quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .

No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .

It is very likely that the preferential enrichments Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .
What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
Some workers proposed that ÎFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ÎFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .

Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature of the magmas .

Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature magmas .
One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .
It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Among them are degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .

Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .

As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ÎFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .

It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .

Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .

( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate oxidation potential of sulfate .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ÎFMQ â 1 and 1500 ppm at ÎFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ÎFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ÎFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .

This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has long been proposed that oxygen fugacities higher than ÎFMQ + 2 have reached the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
More importantly , compared to oxidized magmas , reduced magmas indeed have lower sulfur contents with S 2â occurring as the dominant sulfur species ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , but this does not necessarily mean higher S 2â in reduced magmas as claimed by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
This is probably true along the western margin North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
Some experiments suggest that D Mo increases with decreasing oxygen fugacities ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ÎFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .

From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .

This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ï¬uids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For example , there are also many porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( without economic levels of Mo ) in the western American continents , including some of the world ' s top 25 largest porphyry deposits , e . g . , Cerro Casale in Chile ; Minas Conga in Peru ; Bajo de la Alumbrera in Argentina ; Pebble Copper in the USA ; and Prosperity in Canada .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .

More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .

As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NÎFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S at sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NÎFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
This is probably mainly because the crust in backarc basins is too thin .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .

Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .

As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The addition of subduction released oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to arc magmas is proposed as the most straightforward way , e . g . , water ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , oxidizing fluids and / or melts ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) , fluids with oxidizing components , e . g . , hematite , sulfate ( X . M .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Baogutu is located in West Junggar , Central Asian Orogenic Belt , and is the second largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , with controlled reserves of 0 . 63 Mt Cu @ 0 . 28 wt . % , 14 t Au @ 0 . 1 ppm , 1 . 8 Ã 10 4 t Mo @ 0 . 011 wt . % and 390 t Ag @ 1 . 8 ppm ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
Previous studies suggested that these magmas are a product of continental arc - style magmatism ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
Some researchers have even argued that Cu comes from the mantle , whereas Mo comes from the continental crust ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .
There are several ways to describe the oxidation of ferrous Fe .
Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Baogutu is located in the center of the Eurasian continent .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
Experiments with apatite have shown that SO 3 contents reflect the oxygen fugacity of the magmas ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( Â± Au and Â± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher Îµ Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .
This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( Â± Au and Â± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher Îµ Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .
Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
A similar model has been proposed based on geochemical and mineralogical studies by Shen and Pan ( 2013 ) , in which mineral composition data suggest that the primary magma of the Baogutu porphyry deposit is oxidized .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
Therefore , it does not require very high oxygen fugacities to eliminate residual sulfides .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .

This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
We propose that the reduced features of the Baogutu porphyry deposit are secondary and occurred during emplacement , thus having no major influence on the mineralization process .
It has also been proposed that degassing of SO 2 may lower the oxygen fugacity ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .

The most straightforward way to elevate the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is by the addition of oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to the magmas .

In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .

They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .

Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
Similar to El Teniente , the formation of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposits also lasted for several million years , between 36 and 31 Ma ( Ballard et al . , 2001 ; Ossandon et al . , 2001 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
This was interpreted as the main evidence for degassing ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .

This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .

Further studies are needed on the formation of Sar - Cheshmeh and other Cenozoic porphyry deposits in the belt .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
During a period of recharge by mantle - derived mafic magmas into the base of the chamber and associated volatile transfer and concentration near its roof , the opportunity arose to produce the Cu - and S - rich magmas that formed the anhydrite - bearing intrusive rocks ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
Therefore , it is essential to eliminate residual sulfides to get high Cu contents in magmas for the formation of porphyry deposits .

Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene magnetite and hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .
In principle , there are several ways to lower the oxygen fugacities during magma evolution .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .

Several different explanations for the fertility of adakitic slab melts have been proposed : Oxidized .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values defined by the HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .
This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non erupting pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .

It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .

As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
Degassing , however , is not likely to be a main process in porphyry mineralization that occurs at 2 - 4 km depths in the upper crust .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .

Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .

All the samples with the exception of two were collected from the diorite , which are not porphyry at all .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .

It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry CuâMo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaï¬ei et al . , 2009 ) .
The orange field between HM and ÎFMQ + 2 is the optimum condition for porphyry Cu , Au , Mo mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
C Ã¾ 2Fe 2 O 3 Â¼ 4FeO Ã¾ CO 2Ã°28Ã Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Potassic alteration is located in the center and deeper portions of the porphyry .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
The distribution of porphyry deposits does not support the premise that the Cu comes from the mantle .
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 â is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It has been further proposed that in general geological processes where the tri - sulfur ion may have been involved need to be reconsidered ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , and this would require the investigation of different reaction pathways ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) ) together with alkali contents in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alteration ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ÎFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu Â± Au Â± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
It is located in the western Dabie Mountains , along the east extension of the East Qinling Mo mineralization belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; H . Y .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .

This was attributed to sulfate buffering ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , i . e . , the oxidation of ferrous iron is coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide ( Eqs .

This process , however , was excluded from further consideration based on the low 87 Sr / 86 Sr of Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .
Therefore , subduction of reducing sediments is not a plausible explanation for the low fO 2 shown by the Catface porphyry .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ÎFMQ â 0 . 3 to â 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

It is located in southwestern Iran and is associated with several intrusive pulses of Miocene stocks ( ~ 12 . 2 Ma ) ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) , ranging in composition from diorite through granodiorite to quartzmonzonite ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
Based on the above discussion , we propose the following model for the formation of the Catface porphyry .
As pointed out by the authors , detailed studies are needed to clarify the origin of the CH 4 .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid immiscible phase separation .
Because of these uncertainties , it has been asserted that there is no single , obvious reason why slab melts have an unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits ( Richards , 2013 ) .
Second , there is no systematic difference in terms of emplacement depths and tectonic settings between reduced and oxidized porphyry deposits .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high Îµ Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low Îµ Nd values .

Their contribution depends heavily on subsequent oxidation , i . e . , a major contribution can be expected only when the sulfide cumulates are oxidized to sulfate , liberating the chalcophile elements .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ï¬de saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulï¬de accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

Nevertheless , the oxygen fugacity undoubtedly fluctuated during porphyry mineralization ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , and the hydrothermal rutile only records the oxygen fugacities under which it crystallized .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .

Late alteration and mineralization are characterized muscovite + quartz alteration and is related to D - type veins .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .

All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
The elemental spectra differ , probably as a consequence of different genetic and intrinsic processes , which are part of the general scenario for ore - forming events on hydrothermal vein systems .
The âÎ± and âÎ±L values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .

In recent years , fractal and multifractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .

However , one single number for the fractal dimension , may not be sufficient to describe the complex and 3 heterogeneous behavior of spatial variation resulting from physical , chemical , or genetic processes .
These differences in the aperture of multifractal spectrum suggest a wide range of differences in the overall variability and in the heterogeneity of the studied element distributions which provide direct information on element behavior during crystallization and related differentiation processes .

A recently developed extension of the monofractal approach describes the data with a set of intertwining fractals of different fractal dimensions ( Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Cheng and Agterberg , 1996 ; Cheng , 1999 ; Agterberg , 2001b ; Panahi and Cheng , 2004 ) .
It is destroyed and overprinted by later alteration and mineralization .
This does not only contribute to obtain a full spectrum of element distributions at different scales , but should also provide a new way to characterize different vein types .
Based on this shape characterization , the multifractal distribution can be divided into two groups , one is the left - deviation continuous multifractal mode , and the other is the right - deviation ( âÎ± R ) mode ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) .

This may provide a new insight into evaluation of ore - forming potential .
As can be seen in Table 2 and Figures 9 and 10 , the multifractal parameters created on the basis of element distribution values on mineral surfaces are not the same .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
It is interesting to consider some other parameters like the variability ( V ) and the Ï ( the mass exponent ) ( Cheng , 1999 ) .
Based on the analytical results and previous investigations , the vein systems within the deposit can be divided into four main types as follows : ( 1 ) early quartz veins ( A - type veins ) related to K - feldspar alteration ; ( 2 ) quartz - pyrite - molybdenite - chalcopyrite veins ( B - type veins ) related to chlorite + illite alteration ; ( 3 ) quartz - pyrite - chalcopyrite veins ( D - type veins ) related to late phyllic ( muscovite + quartz ) alteration ; and ( 4 ) the latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ( H - type veins ) .

The objectives of this work were firstly to identify different vein types , and secondly to evaluate the potential of multifractal parameters , constructed using the so - called method of moments , to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of concentration of elements on mineral surfaces which may provide insight into hydrothermal mineralization and its effect on spatial and temporal distribution of element concentration .
These parameters are indicators of symmetry / asymmetry of the multifractal system ( Montero , 2005 ; Miranda et al . , 2006 ; Arias et al . , 2012 ) .
Based on the analytical results and other previous investigations , the vein systems were divided into four main vein types and associated alteration and mineralization stages .
The objective of this study is to identify different vein types by means of detailed field , microscopic , X - Ray Diffraction ( XRD ) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy ( ESEM ) examinations , to reveal the micro - distribution of elements on the crystal surfaces of pyrites found in veins of different types .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
Most applications of fractal theory use the monofractal - approach , which assumes that the spatial distribution of an element or other property of an object can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .

Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
This result is consistent with previous research on the area as well as new field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis carried out for this study .
Carlson , 1991 ) , but little has been done on the concentration micro - distribution of elements at the crystal surfaces of major ore minerals ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
Tailings generated during processing of sulfide ores represent a substantial risk to water resources .
The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low - quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO 4 , Fe , and associated metal ( loid ) s . Acid generated during the oxidation of pyrite [ FeS 2 ] , pyrrhotite S ] and other sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .

Acid generated during the oxidation of sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .
Metals including Fe ( III ) , Cu , Zn , and Ni often occur at high concentrations and exhibit greater mobility at low pH characteristic of acid mine drainage ( AMD ) .
Reduction - oxidation ( redox ) processes are another important control on metal ( loid ) mobility within sulfide tailings deposits .
Mining and processing of sulfide ores generates large volumes of waste materials that can have severe and widespread impacts on water resources ( EspaÃ±a et al . , 2005 ; Concas et al . , 2006 ; Moncur et al . , 2006 , 2014 ; PÃ©rez - LÃ³pez et al . , 2011 ) .
Sulfide ore deposits host globally significant amounts of Cu , Ni , Zn , Pb and other economically important metals .
Sulfide ore deposits are also important sources of Au and Ag , which may occur as native elements or be associated with sulfides .
Mill tailings are a principal solid waste generated at sulfide mining operations .
Anionic surfactants commonly used for sulfide flotation include xanthates and dithiophosphates .
The hydrophobic sulfide minerals attach by surface tension to the bubble interface and are transported vertically to 4 the surface of the flotation cell .
Silicates , carbonates and sulfides generally dominate the mineralogical assemblage of fresh tailings .
The sulfide mineral component includes both gangue minerals and residual ore minerals not extracted during concentration due to ineffective separation from the rock matrix .
Sulfide minerals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen and water .
Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of Fe - and S - oxidizing bacteria .

Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of S - oxidizing bacteria .
The pH tailings pore water and drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .
The pH drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .
Acid mine drainage ( AMD ) develops in tailings deposits where the neutralization capacity of carbonate minerals is depleted due to ongoing 5 sulfide - mineral oxidation .
High dissolved concentrations of Fe and SO4 generated via sulfide oxidation can promote formation of hardpan layers comprised of Fe ( oxy ) hydroxides or ( hydroxy ) sulfates .
Redox reactions can strongly influence the mobility of elements including S , Fe , As , and Se , which exhibit multiple oxidation states .
Iron reduction can promote dissolution or transformation of Fe ( III ) ( oxy ) hydroxides and , therefore , has potential to impact metal ( loid ) mobility .
Acid generation associated with this process is neutralized in the presence of carbonate minerals to maintain circumneutral pH conditions .
Metals including Fe , Al , Zn , Cu , and Pb generally exhibit greater mobility under acidic pH conditions .
The mineralogical sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The mineralogical and geochemical composition sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The fine - grained slurry is then introduced to aerated flotation cells where a frothing agent is added to promote bubble formation .
The sulfide - bearing froth is collected by decantation and residual slurry may undergo additional concentration .
The Greens Creek Mine is a NMD site and the Sherridon Mine is an AMD site .
These metals commonly occur in chalcopyrite [ CuFeS2 ] , pentlandite [ ( Fe , Ni ) 9S8 ] , sphalerite [ ( Zn , Fe ) S ] , and galena [ PbS ] ; however , gangue minerals including pyrite and pyrrhotite often dominate sulfide assemblages .
After ore minerals have been extracted and concentrated , the resulting tailings are commonly dewatered and deposited in sub - aerial tailings impoundments or stockpiles ( Blowes et al . , 2003 ) .
These tailings are generally characterized by elevated concentrations of weakly hydrolyzing metals including Fe ( II ) , Zn and Cd , and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Se , and Sb .
Several metals including Fe , Al , Mn , Zn , Ni , Cu , and Pb may occur at high dissolved concentrations under AMD conditions .
Finally , pH - dependent sorption onto tailings solids can strongly influence the mobility of metals and trace elements released via sulfide - mineral oxidation .
Although AMD conditions exist at the Nickel Rim Mine , carbonate mineral dissolution sustains zones of circumneutral pH within the tailings deposit .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation ( redox ) , and sorption - desorption reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation ( redox ) , and sorption - desorption reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Moreover , gypsum [ CaSO4Â·2H2O ] precipitation is often a principal control on dissolved SO4 2 - concentrations in carbonate - rich tailings deposits .
Production of H 2 S via microbial sulfate reduction may promote attenuation of sulfide - oxidation products , including Fe , Zn , Ni , and Tl , via metal - sulfide precipitation .
The resulting clay - to silt - sized particles are combined with water to form slurry and then treated with surfactants to render sulfide ore minerals hydrophobic .
The resulting oxidative weathering of sulfides can generate H + and release sulfate and metal ( loid ) s to tailings pore waters .
In contrast , neutral mine drainage ( NMD ) conditions generally persist in tailings deposits where carbonate dissolution effectively neutralizes acid generated by ongoing sulfide - mineral oxidation .
Production of H2S via sulfate reduction can promote precipitation of sparingly soluble metal - sulfide phases , whereas reduction of As ( V ) to As ( III ) typically enhances As mobility .
The resulting pH strongly influences concentrations and mobility of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation .
In contrast , weakly hydrolyzing metals ( e . g . , Fe ( II ) , Zn , Cd ) and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements ( e . g . , As , Se , Sb ) tend to exhibit greater mobility under circumneutral pH conditions .
Consumption of carbonate minerals due to ongoing sulfide - mineral oxidation often precedes a transition to acidic pH conditions .
Cemented layers of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide and ( hydroxy ) sulfate minerals , referred to as hardpans , may promote attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products within and below the oxidation zone .
The selectivity of froth flotation for specific sulfide minerals is dependent upon surfactant , slurry pH , and surface interactions with dissolved ions .
In contrast , ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Sb , Se , and Mo commonly exhibit greater mobility at circumneutral pH associated with neutral mine drainage ( NMD ) .
Hardpans may also limit oxygen ingress and pore - water migration within sulfide tailings deposits .
Case studies include the Greens Creek Mine ( Alaska , USA ) , Nickel Rim Mine ( Ontario , Canada ) and Sherritt - Gordon ( Sherridon ) Mine ( Manitoba , Canada ) ( Fig . 1 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
Finally , a series of secondary redox reactions , including Fe ( II ) oxidation , Fe ( III ) reduction , and SO 4 reduction can strongly influence the mobility of metal ( loid ) s within tailings deposits .
The transport and attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products are influenced by precipitation - dissolution , sorption - desorption , and redox reactions .
Despite their economic importance , sulfide minerals are also major sources of potentially toxic accessory elements including As , Se , Cd , Sb , and Hg .
Reductive dissolution or transformation of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide phases can enhance Fe , Mn , and As mobility within sulfide tailings .
Understanding the dynamics of these interrelated geochemical and mineralogical processes is critical for anticipating and managing water quality associated with sulfide mine tailings . Geochemistry and mineralogy of sulfide mine tailings are reviewed Case studies highlight metal ( loid ) release , transport and attenuation processes Interactions among chemical , biological and physical processes are complex Effective tailings management requires comprehensive understanding of processes

The majority of known deposits are genetically related to intermediate to felsic calcalkaline magmas in volcanoplutonic arcs above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1A ) .
Arc magmas are predominantly formed by partial melting of the metasomatized wedge of asthenospheric mantle between the downgoing oceanic and overriding oceanic or continental plates ( Ringwood , 1977 ) .

These cumulates contain large amounts of amphibole along with olivine , pyroxene , and plagioclase , and garnet in thicker arc sections .
Magmas processed through these lower crustal MASH zones commonly display relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the suppression of early plagioclase crystallization and the preferential partitioning of Y and middle and heavy rare earth elements into amphibole and garnet ( Green and Pearson , 1985 ) .

Magma generation beneath an arc may cease for several reasons , including migration of the locus of melting due to changes in the angle of subduction ( e . g . , North and South American Cordillera ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) , subduction reversal or jumping ( e . g . , southwest Pacifi c ; Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , or collision that terminates subduction ( e . g . , Papua New Guinea and southwest Asia ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Richards et al . , 1990 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ) .
Translithospheric extensional structures provide channelways for rapid ascent of mantlederived magmas to upper crustal levels , with little crustal interaction ( Richards et al . , 1990 ) .

Arc magmatism leaves a large amount of hydrous residue at the base of the crust and in the lithospheric mantle ( Fig . 1A ) , which , due to the high magmatic sulfur content ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , likely also contains some residual sulfi de phases .
Arc magmas , although sulfur rich , are also relatively oxidized , such that the bulk of the sulfur is present as SO 2 dissolved in the magma ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Chalcophile and siderophile elements such as Cu , Ni , Au , and PGE partition strongly into sulfi de phases relative to silicate melts , with partition coefficients increasing from Cu < Ni < Au and PGE ( Peach et al . , 1990 ) .

These magmas originate by partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
These basaltic magmas evolve and interact with the upper plate litho sphere as they ascend to form hybrid andesitic magmas characterized by relatively high oxidation states ( typically ~ 2 log f O2 units higher than the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer ) and high water contents ( â¥4 wt % H 2 O ) ( as reviewed in Richards , 2003 ) .
Thus , postsubduction magmatism tends to be spatially isolated , and mildly ( high - K Â± Na calcalkaline ) to strongly alkaline in character .

Although magmas with these characteristics most commonly form directly in response to inputs from the subduction zone , it is also possible to extract compositionally and isotopically similar magmas from upper plate lithosphere that has been modifi ed by prior subduction processes , but with melting caused by later postsubduction events ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ) .

In mature island arcs or continental arcs , primitive basaltic magmas ascending from the mantle wedge typically stall at the base of the upper plate crust due to density contrasts ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ) .
However , the lack of active subduction and their crustal isotopic compositions preclude a slab - melting origin ( Hou et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) .
Associated magmas tend to be mildly alkaline , relatively sul - fur poor , and emplaced as isolated complexes rather than in voluminous volcanoplutonic arcs .
In contrast , postsubduction arc contraction caused by collision may lead to crustal thickening and delamination of the SCLM , with partial melting occurring in depressed lower crustal rocks as isotherms rebound or hot asthenospheric melts invade ( Figs . 1B and 1C ) .
Accordingly , arc magmas are commonly associated with high - sulfi dation - style epithermal deposits , whereas postsubduction systems are more typically low sulfi dation .
In the case of postsubduction arc extension , decompression melting may occur in upwelling subduction - metasomatized asthenosphere and / or attenuated lithosphere , leading to the generation of mafi c alkaline ( shoshonitic or hawaiitic ) magmas ( Fig . 1D ; Luhr , 1997 ; Paquette et al . , 2003 ) .
The presence of amphibole and / or garnet in the lower crustal former arc source rocks may accentuate the high Sr / Y and La / Yb signatures of these magmas , leading to their ( mis - ) identifi cation as adakites in some cases .

If this fertile , hydrous residue is subjected to a second stage of melting , either by invasion of small volumes of hot , oxidized asthenospheric magma , or thermal rebound after lithospheric thickening ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) , then Au - rich residual sulfide phases may redissolve ( R â¥ 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) to generate magmas with relatively high Au / Cu ratios ( Solomon , 1990 ; Richards , 2005 ) and perhaps also PGE enrichments ( cf .

Thus , regions of postsubduction magma - tism , which may have been overlooked by min - eral exploration strategies in the past , have the potential to host signiï¬ cant Au - rich porphyry and epithermal deposits .

It is proposed that these deposits were formed from hydrous magmas derived by partial remelting of the metasomatized lithospheric roots and hydrous cumulate zones of former arc systems , in response to a variety of mechanisms such as lithospheric thickening and thermal rebound , subcontinental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) delamination , or lithospheric extension ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) .

During second - stage postsubduction mag - matism , these small volumes of sulï¬ de will remelt , releasing their metal contents to the alkaline silicate magma .
Recently , a number of porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits have been described in association with such magmas , with ages and from locations that are incompatible with a relationship to contemporaneous subduction , but consistent with postsubduction or collisional tectonic settings .

Examples include : the Eocene ÃÃ¶pler epithermal Au deposit in eastern central Turkey , which postdates Cretaceous - Paleocene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ) ; the late Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwest Iran , which postdates Paleogene - early Neogene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Richards et al . , 2006 ) ; Neogene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the southwest Pacifi c , which followed collision or subduction reversal ( Solomon , 1990 ) ; and mid - Miocene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in Tibet , which postdate Late Cretaceous collision between India and Asia ( Hou et al . , 2005 ) .
They are likely formed by remelting of previously subduction - modiï¬ ed arc lithosphere , trig - gered by postsubduction lithospheric thickening , lithospheric extension , or mantle lithosphere delamination .
Where moderate amounts of sulfi de are present relative to the volume of silicate melt ( R = 10 2 - 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) , the concentration of Cu in the magma will be minimally affected because of its greater overall abundance ( tens to hundreds of parts per million ) and lower partition coeffi cient ( D â10 3 ) , whereas sparse ( parts per million to parts per billion ) Au , Ni , and other highly siderophile elements ( D â¥ 10 5 ) will be depleted in the magma ( Fig . 2 ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) .
All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
All of these systems formed in extensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
Nevertheless , small amounts of sulfi de ( as melt or crystalline phases ) can be expected to be present , which because of its high density will tend to settle out in cumulate zones .
In contrast , the complementary residual sulfi des will be enriched in these highly siderophile elements .
Because of their sparsity ( under the relatively oxidizing but S - rich conditions of arc mag - matism ) , these sulï¬ de phases will be enriched in Au and other highly siderophile elements .

Depending on the cause , the former arc may undergo stress states ranging from tension ( rifting ) to compression ( collision ) .
A corollary of this process is that postsubduction magmas and associated hydrothermal ore deposits will be less sulfur rich than fi rst - stage arc systems .
Late - stage partition - ing of these metals into hydrothermal ï¬ uids exsolved during cooling and crystallization of this magma at upper crustal levels generates magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits superï¬ - cially similar to arc - related porphyry and epi - thermal deposits , but more enriched in Au and of generally lower sulï¬ dation state .

Both states may lead to a brief resurgence in magmatism ( Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ; Paquette et al . , 2003 ) .
Davidson et al . ( 2007 ) proposed that these amphibole - rich cumulates act like a sponge , storing as much as 20 % of the water in the original arc magma fl ux .
) , with essentially instantaneous cessation of arc volcanism ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ) .
The most characteristic mineralization style in extensional postsubduction environments is alkalic - type epithermal Au , associated with mafi c alkalic intrusive complexes ( Richards , 1995 ) .
They are thus directly linked to the petrogenesis of arc magmas , and derive their fundamental characteristics ( e . g . , relatively high oxidation state and enrichments in alkalies , S , Cl , H 2 O , and some metals ) from subduction processes .
These two characteristics are critical to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits ( Candela , 1992 ) : the high oxidation state suppresses the formation of signifi cant amounts of magmatic sulfi de phases , which would strip the magma of chalcophile and siderophile metals ( e . g . , Fe , Cu , Au , Mo ; Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 2005 ) ; and the high water content results in saturation of the magma in an aqueous fl uid phase upon ascent into the upper crust , into which these metals will effi ciently partition ( Candela and Holland , 1984 ) .
These broad similarities , but also subtle differences , in both magma composition and ore deposit style suggest similar petrogenetic and metallogenic processes , differing only in detail .
However , there is increasing evidence for the existence of a suite of porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits related to magmas generated after subduc - tion beneath the arc has ceased .

In both cases ( extension or contraction ) , the source region is previously subduction - modifi ed lithosphere Â± asthenosphere , and the postsubduction magmas therefore share many of the geo chemical and isotopic characteristics of the pre ceding arc magmatism .

In a process described by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) as melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) , heat released from this mafi c magma input causes partial melting of crustal rocks .

High fO2 would increase sulfur solubility in the magma , thus prohibiting early removal of metals via sulfide precipitation .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits are mainly formed in subduction - related magmatic arcs ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1972Sillitoe , , 2010Richards , 2003 ) , yet it is still unclear why some magmatic arcs ( or sections of a magmatic arc ) are more Cu - endowed ( e . g . , Andes ; Sillitoe , 2012 ) .
High fO2 can significantly increase sulfur solubility in magmas ( e . g . , Jugo et al . , 2005 ; Jugo , 2009 ; Hou and Zhang , 2015 ) , and thus prohibit early sulfide saturation ( e . g . , Sun et al . , 2015 , 2017 ) .
Volatile ( mainly water ) contents were likely increased in the residual melts via magmatic differentiation and / or via mafic magma replenishments .

High water contents promote the exsolution of aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Richards , 2011 ; Wang R et al . , 2014 ) , and substantially increase the efficiency of metal extraction from the silicate melts ( or crystal mush ) .

The Late Triassic Pulang intrusive complex comprises five phase of porphyrtic stocks and dikes ( ca .
The oxidized nature of the parental magmas at Pulang indicates that sulfides may not have saturated during the magma emplacement , so that the PGE contents in the silicate melts remain unchanged .
( 3 ) Two kinds of amphibole with different Al2O3 contents are identified at Pulang , which were likely crystallized in the deeper ( 11 â 18 km ) and shallower ( 3 â 7 km ) part of the magma chambers , respectively .

5 . 3 Oxidized parental magma of the Pulang complex As mentioned above , two types of amphibole , namely high - Al and low - Al amphiboles , were identified at the Pulang complex . Mineralogical compositions of different amphiboles can be used to evaluate the physicochemical conditions ( e . g . , pressure , temperature , oxygen fugacity and water content ) of the parental magma 17 from which the amphibole crystallized ( Fig . 14 ) , using the amphibole thermobarometers ( e . g . , Johnson and Rutherford , 1989 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) .

( 4 ) High oxygen fugacity and high water contents were two critical ore - forming 20 critical ore - forming factors for the Pulang porphyry Cu - Au deposit .
Both the intrusive complex and the related volcanic wall rocks have similar PGE concentrations , Pd / Pt ratios and primitive mantle - normalized PGE patterns , indicating that no discernible Two types of amphibole , i . e . , high - Al ( Al2O3 = 9 . 4 â 11 . 8 wt . % ) and low - Al ( 5 . 9 â 7 . 3 wt . % ) types , have been identified in the Pulang complex .

Thus , the whole - rock trace elements and zircon Hf - O isotopes do not support a common magmatic source between the intrusive and The Pulang complex is mainly andesitic to dacitic , broadly lying on the fractional crystallization trends defined by the lavas ( Fig . 10a - f ) .
Due to the higher partition coefficients between the sulfide and silicate melts of Pt against Pd ( Fleet et al . , 1999 ) , sulfide crystallization would increase the Pd / Pt ratios in the residual magmas ( > 1 ) .
) , and was more oxidized ( NNO + 1 . 0 â NNO + 1 . 7 ) with a low H2O content ( 4 . 2 â 4 . 9 wt . % ) .
Although the Pulang intrusive complex and the volcanic wall rocks contain slightly varying PGE concentrations ( Table 3 ) , all the rocks do not show PGE enrichments relative to OIB ( Fig . 12 ) .
Thus , both high oxygen fugacity and water contents are ( 2 ) The Pulang complex was likely formed in a long - lived ( ~ 5 m . y . )
A new model of porphyry Cu system , which involves pre - enrichment of Cu through sulfide accumulation near the mantle - crust boundary , has been recently proposed to account for variations of Cu endowment in different magmatic arcs .
230 â 218 Ma ) volcanic - sedimentary sequence of the Tumugou Formation .
The consistent zircon Hf - O isotopes , together with the deficiency of inherited zircons in the Pulang complex ( Fig . 4 ) , suggest that crustal assimilation was likely minimal .
Although these magmas were oxidized , which is favorable for ore metal transport , they may have different physicochemical properties as indicated by the varying amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) .
( 1 ) Both the Pulang complex and the mafic - intermediate volcanic wall rocks have similar PGE abundances and mantle - normalized PGE patterns , implying that no appreciable sulfide cumulates were lost or gained during the magma fractionation in the upper crust .
We suggest that oxygen fugacity and H2O content of the magma are two critical factors that controlled the Pulang porphyry Cu - Au metallogeny .
Meanwhile , the melts equilibrated with the low - Al amphibole were likely more oxidized ( NNO + 1 . 0 â NNO + 1 . 7 ) but with lower H2O content ( 4 . 2â 4 . 9 wt . % ) .
In this study , the most mafic rocks ( i . e . , alkaline basalt ) contain high PPGE concentrations ( Pd = 5 . 9 ppb , Pt = 5 . 4 ppb ) , comparable to those of the typical arc basalts ( e . g . , basalts from the Tonga Rear Arc ; Park et al . , 2015 ) , and higher than 18 those of basalts from the Cameroon Line suite , which were suggested to have formed from low - degree ( < 8 % ) partial melting of mantle peridotite ( RehkÃ¤mper et al . , 1999 ) .
The variation in PGE concentrations between different types of rocks at Pulang is probably ascribed to magma mixing between mafic and felsic end - members .
16 The covariant ÎµHf ( t ) vs . Î´18O zircon arrays of the analyzed rocks exhibit a negative linear relationship ( Fig . 13 ) , implying a trend of magma mixing between two end - members ( e . g . , Kemp et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
In addition , the higher H2O content may have enhanced volatile exsolution from the 2 evolving magmas at Pulang .
In addition , the volcanic rocks have more positive ÎµHf ( t ) ( 3 . 7 Â± 0 . 3 ) and mantle - like Î´18O signatures ( 5 . 8 â° ) than those of the intrusive rocks ( ÎµHf ( t ) = - 0 . 8 â 0 . 1 ; Î´18O ratios < 6 . 4 â° ) , indicative of different origins .
Furthermore , the PGE variations in the studied rocks can also be explained by the mixing of two melt end - members .
Nonetheless , the IPGE depletions could also be led by the presence of certain IPGE - rich phases ( e . g . , alloy , Cr spinel and chromite ; Barnes and Lightfoot , 2005 ) in the melt residue .
Therefore , either high - degree ( > 18 â 25 % ) of partial melting , or moderate - degree of melting ( > 11 % ) of an oxidized source ( where sulfide phases are unstable ) , can significantly increase the PGE concentrations in the magmas ( Arndt et al . , 2005 , and references therein ) .
We propose that the Pulang magma did not undergo early sulfide removal , and that the magma was likely sulfide - unsaturated during its emplacement .
Thus , the relatively low PGE contents of the Pulang magmatic rocks preclude the existence of early Cu - rich sulfide accumulation at depth .
At Pulang , most of the volcanic rocks have consistent Pd / Pt ratios of ~ 1 ( Fig . 12 ; Table 3 ) , indicating that the lavas may not have fractionated Pt - alloys or sulfides .
This is because PGE , as highly - chalcophile elements , have D sulfide liquid / silicate melt ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
geochemistry of the giant Pulang porphyry Cu - Au system in the Sanjiang Region , SW China .
It has been suggested that compressive arc settings , notably those led by aseismic ridge or flat - slab subduction , are favorable for producing large and high - grade porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1988 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Tosdal et al . , 2009 ) .
5 . 2 Genetic link between porphyries and volcanic rocks at Pulang Porphyry stocks , as by - products of subduction - related magmas , are commonly emplaced in a subvolcanic environment covered by a volcanic edifice of pyroclastic rocks and / or lava flows ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1973 , 2010 ) , which is also documented at 15 plutons ( mostly intermediate in composition ) .
They were likely formed at shallower depths ( 3 â 7 km ) at low temperatures ( 770 â 810 â ) .
Therefore , the importance of early accumulation of Cu - rich sulfides in later porphyry mineralization remains unclear .
Therefore , we propose that the parental magmas of the Pulang complex may have formed by mixing of two magmas , as supported by the wide variation range of plagioclase phenocryst ( An6 â An60 ; Fig . 7 ) and amphibole ( Fig . 9 ) compositions .
5 . 1 Timing and duration of the Pulang intrusive activity At Pulang , the pre - mineralized QDP has zircon U - Pb ages of ca .
They are slightly older than the potassic alteration and the related mineralization ( ca .
This is because PGE are extremely chalcophile , and are predominantly hosted by sulfide and / or alloy phases in the mantle .
Furthermore , as reflected by the low - Al amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) , the inferred H2Omelt content decreased ( < 4 . 9 wt . % ) with increasing oxygen fugacity ( > NNO + 1 . 0 ) .
This may have occurred during the onset of volatile exsolution at shallow depths , and represents another factor that promoted ore formation ( Cline , 2003 ) .
However , the genetic link between the intrusive and extrusive rocks is not always clear .
To summarize , this study confirms that magma mixing is a plausible mechanism to produce the PGE variation observed at Pulang .
Many recent studies , based largely on the platinum - group elements ( PGE ) geochemistry , were conducted to elucidate the sulfide saturation history in porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Gao et al . , 2015 ; Park et al . , 2015 ; Cocker et al . , 2016 ; Hao et al . , 2017 ) .
Sun et al . ( 2017 ) also suggested that such Cu pre - enrichment through sulfide saturation is not a prerequisite for generating large porphyry Cu deposits .
Our petrological modeling demonstrates that most zircons from the Pulang complex crystallized from a melt containing up to 40 â 50 % crustal materials , and around 10 â 20 % for the volcanic lavas ( Fig . 13 ) .
The results show that the magmas equilibrated with the high - Al amphibole may have contained 4 . 8 â 6 . 2 wt . % H2O , and formed at a depth of 11 â 18 km at 858 â 935 â , and an oxygen fugacity of NNO + 0 . 2 â NNO + 1 . 5 ( Fig . 14 ) .
A similar conclusion has also been reached in the study on the Kelian Au deposit ( Setiabudi et al . , 2007 ) , implying that magma mixing may have been a common yet often underestimated phenomenon .
On the other hand , the geometry ( i . e . , curvature ) of the ÎµHf ( t ) vs . Î´18O arrays can be used to constraint the relative Hf isotope compositions of the end - members ( e . g . , Kemp et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
The model predicted that approximately 2 / 3 of the Cu budget of primary arc magmas is possibly stripped by sulfides near the lithospheric mantle - crust boundary .
Three models have been proposed to interpret this linkage : ( 1 ) fractional crystallization from a common parental magma ( e . g . , Sisson and Grove , 1993 ; Sisson et al . , 2005 ; Feig et al . , 2006 ; Ulmer , 2007 ) , ( 2 ) mixing and hybridization of two end - member melts ( e . g . , Groves et al . , 2005 ; Reubi and Blundy , 2009 ) , and ( 3 ) the melt expulsion model ( especially for rhyolite , Bachmann and Bergantz , 2004 ; Bachmann et al . , 2007 ; Bachmann and Huber 2016 ) , in which the volcanic rocks are regarded as erupted melt - rich regions , while the crystal mush crystallized to form the depleted in incompatible and compatible elements ( Fig . 10e , f ) .
As shown in Figure 13 , the two end - members are expected to have similar Hf concentrations , which are substantiated by previous studies ( He et al . , 2013 ; Leng et al . , 2014 ) .
To test this model and explore the possible controlling factors of porphyry Cu metallogeny , we studied the mineralogy and platinum - group element ( PGE ) sulfide cumulates were lost or gained during magmatic differentiation .
5 . 5 Ore - forming controls of the Pulang Cu - Au deposit This study concludes that both the intrusive and extrusive rocks at Pulang have not experienced early sulfide removal or addition , and thus the parental magmas were 19 likely sulfide - unsaturated prior to their emplacement .
However , this hypothesis was challenged by Richards ( 2015 ) , who argued that the volume of sulfide accumulations is too small to significantly affect the Cu budget of primary arc magmas .
If the sample DSG11 - 15 ( with the lowest SiO2 and the highest PGE contents ) is taken as the mafic end - member and the Upper Continental Crust ( Rudnick and Gao , 2014 ) as the felsic end - member , most of the PGE data of the Pulang intrusive and extrusive rocks can be reproduced by mixing between the two end - members with various ratios ( not shown ) .
5 . 4 Removal and accumulation of sulfides during magma emplacement Previous studies demonstrated that the PGE abundance in primary basaltic magmas are controlled largely by the degree of partial melting and the oxidization state of the mantle peridotite ( Keays , 1995 ; Arndt et al . , 2005 ; Naldrett , 2010 ; Gao et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) .
Although these two amphibole types contain different water contents ( Fig . 14c ) , both were crystallized from oxidized magmas ( > NNO + 0 . 2 ) , as also supported by the large amount of magnetite observed .
Some studies also argued that the reason for this heterogeneity of Cu endowment may lie deeper in the crust , e . g . , a recent model proposed that high Cu endowment in some magmatic arcs may have led by the accumulation of cupriferous sulfides at the base of continental arcs ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2012 ; Chiaradia , 2013 ; Hou et al . , 2017 ) .

Local metal enriched rocks can become an ore body that can be mined at an economic profit .
The multifractal distributions of concentration of chemical elements on the surface of pyrite crystals selected from veins of different types were investigated using digital images generated by means of ESEM .
Vein types at Tongchang ore body and their alteration and mineralization characteristics .
The early K - feldspar alteration and related A - type veins is observed only in few places on small scale .
The chlorite + illite alteration is transitional and characterized by B - type veins .
Late alteration and mineralization are characterized muscovite + quartz alteration and is related to D - type veins .
A range of trace elements , including Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti were analyzed on the surface of pyrite crystals using ESEM .
This apparent multifractal behavior reveal that the spatial variability of studied element concentrations on surface of pyrite crystals from different veins and veinlets can be successfully correlated with the vein types and related alteration and mineralization zone delineated using other customized geological methods .
The spatial distribution of ore - forming elements at different scales is of primary importance for ore exploration , and researches in recent decades have demonstrated that similarity exists at different scales , or non - scale distribution , which can be investigated by fractal / multifractal theory .
The Cu concentration in D - type vein pyrite is higher than that in pyrite from other veins and veinlets .
For pyrite from the same mineralization stage , different samples show more or less different trace element distributions and even a single pyrite crystal may contain different levels of trace elements .
The multifractal analysis of elemental micro - distributions on scale of pyrite crystal surfaces were employed to allow quantitative insights into the geometrical organization of these elements .
The elemental spectra differ , probably as a consequence of different genetic and intrinsic processes , which are part of the general scenario for ore - forming events on hydrothermal vein systems .
Also , geometrical properties and scale - independent characteristics of anomalies were considered in fractal / multifractal methods ( Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Cheng and Agterberg , 1996 ) .
Several multifractal parameters were calculated , however , the most significant ones are âÎ± and âÎ±L .
Most applications of fractal theory use the monofractal - approach , which assumes that the spatial distribution of an element or other property of an object can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .
To 1 achieve our goal , the distribution patterns of element concentration values of eight elements ( Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si and Ti ) on the pyrite surface selected from B - type , D - type and H - type veins and veinlets were represented by multifractal spectra .
We note , however , that fractured parts of the crystals often contain higher levels of trace elements .
The local variability of hydrothermal mineralization can result in element concentration enrichment or depletion , and locally metal enriched rocks can become mineable ore bodies .
To achieve this objective , the distribution of Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of elements caused by mineralization is crucial for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of element concentration enrichment or depletion caused by hydrothermal mineralization is of great importance for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
The results indicate that the element concentration pattern in D - type veins and related alteration and mineralization is highly dispersed and , therefore , most favorable for Cu ore - concentration .
Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
It is destroyed and overprinted by later alteration and mineralization .

A higher âÎ± value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
A higher âÎ± value indicates that the concentration of an element more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
A higher âÎ± value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for ore - forming processes .
This does not only contribute to obtain a full spectrum of element distributions at different scales , but should also provide a new way to characterize different vein types .
The objective of this study is to identify different vein types by means of detailed field , microscopic , X - Ray Diffraction ( XRD ) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy ( ESEM ) examinations , to reveal the micro - distribution of elements on the crystal surfaces of pyrites found in veins of different types .
These parameters are found to be higher in the D - type veins related to late phyllic alteration and mineralization in comparison with other veins and vein systems , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are highly enriched in D - type veins .
All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
Carlson , 1991 ) , but little has been done on the concentration micro - distribution of elements at the crystal surfaces of major ore minerals ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
The objectives of this work were firstly to identify different vein types , and secondly to evaluate the potential of multifractal parameters , constructed using the so - called method of moments , to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of concentration of elements on mineral surfaces which may provide insight into hydrothermal mineralization and its effect on spatial and temporal distribution of element concentration .
The rock samples were collected at different localities from veins within hydrothermal systems of the Dexing porphyry copper deposit ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
Based on the analytical results and previous investigations , the vein systems within the deposit can be divided into four main types as follows : ( 1 ) early quartz veins ( A - type veins ) related to K - feldspar alteration ; ( 2 ) quartz - pyrite - molybdenite - chalcopyrite veins ( B - type veins ) related to chlorite + illite alteration ; ( 3 ) quartz - pyrite - chalcopyrite veins ( D - type veins ) related to late phyllic ( muscovite + quartz ) alteration ; and ( 4 ) the latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ( H - type veins ) .
The latest 11 alteration and mineralization stage is characterized by carbonate - sulphate - oxide alteration and associated with H - type veins ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body .
The âÎ± and âÎ±L values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .
In recent years , fractal and multifractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
Therefore , the multifractal parameters , particularly , âÎ± and âÎ±L appear to be promising to discriminate between mineralized veins developed during different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body .
This multifractal procedure has been used to characterize variability of many natural phenomena , including characteristics of mineralization and mineral deposits ( Carlson , 1991 ; Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Sanderson et al . , 1994 ; Agterberg , 1995 ; Turcotte , 1997 , 2002 ; Gumiel et al . , 2010 ; Arias et al . , 2011 ) .
Hence , in this study , the multifractal parameters , particularly , âÎ± and âÎ±L appear to be promising parameters to discriminate between mineralized veins developed at different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body of the Dexing Porphyry copper Deposit .
This is consistent with field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis and previous investigations by other authors including Mao et al . ( 2011 ) , showing that the D - type veins are the most important for the mineralization in the Dexing porphyry deposit .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
These differences in the aperture of multifractal spectrum suggest a wide range of differences in the overall variability and in the heterogeneity of the studied element distributions which provide direct information on element behavior during crystallization and related differentiation processes .

The propylitic alteration invariably overprints the quartzâ sericite alteration at different degrees and inevitably further modiï¬es the Cu mineralization .
The mineralization intensities change from weak ( a ) to intense ( b , c , & d ) and to stable and intense ( e ) .
In the potassium - silicate and quartz - sericite alteration zones , the correlation dimension and the exponent of lacunarity are stable and well correlated .
From the economic geology sense , set ( a ) could represent the weakly mineralization in propylitization and hornfels , and set ( b ) could represent the intense mineralization in potassium - silicate zone .
As for the propylitic zone and hornfels , the distributions of Cu in mineralized drillcores are more heterogeneous , showing weaker compactness of high concentrations , and smaller proportion of high concentrations than in non - mineralized drillcores .

Links between mineralization intensity , elemental spatial pattern and dynamic control In this study , the relationships among fractal indices show that the D2 has obviously negative relation with Î²L for the different alteration zones .
The distributions of Cu in potassium - silicate and quartzâsericite al - teration zones are more homogeneous , and have stronger compactness of high concentrations and greater proportion of high concentrations compared to those in the other alteration zones .

The concentrations of metallogenic metals in mineralized zones often exhibit skewed statisti - cal distributions and similarities in spatial distributions across a range of scales of several magnitudes of difference , and can be described by various fractal models ( Deng et al . , 2009 , 2010 ; Gumiel et al . , 2010 ; He et al . , 2013 ; Luz et al . , 2014 ; Monecke et al . , 2001 ; Wan et al . , 2010 ; â Corresponding author at : State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources , China University of Geosciences , Beijing , No .
This denotes that the H and Îf ( Î± ) are not robust dis - criminating indices for the mineralization and different alterations in the study area .
In this paper , various fractal indices , including the exponent of lacunarity , multifractal spectrum , correlation dimension and Hurst exponent , are applied to characterize the Cu spatial distribution in 114 drillcores in the Pulang ore deposit , with the aim to correlate the element spatial pattern with its dynamic drive .

In this study , compared to H and Îf ( Î± ) , although the Î²L and D2 varied in different alteration zones , they are much stable in the core of Fig . 8 .
As expected , in concert with mineralization intensity , the Î²L values decrease from sets ( a ) to ( e ) , yet the D2 values increase ( Fig . 11 ) , indicating that the greater complexity of controls results in more homogeneous elemental distribution and more stable orebody in the mineralized core in porphy - ry ore system .

Compared to fractal indices in the propylitic zone and hornfels , the exponents of lacunarity in the potassium - silicate and quartz - sericite zones exhibit lower and more stable values , the correlation dimensions are higher and more consistent ; yet the values of height difference of multifractal spectrum are lower and largely varied , and the Hurst exponents show little difference .

This collectively suggests that the mineralization process experienced changes of ï¬rst in - crease and then decrease for indices Î²L and Îf ( Î± ) , and an opposite trend for D2 .
Previous studies have found that the H values in skarn , porphyry and structure - controlled disseminated deposits are greater than 0 . 5 ; thus , the element distribution shows persistent behavior , indicating stable repetitions ( or recurrences ) of mineralization ( Liu et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2011a ; Zuo et al . , 2009 ) .

From ( a ) to ( e ) , with the upgrade of mineralization intensity , the correlation dimensions increase and the exponents of lacunarity decrease .
Nevertheless , this study reveals that the H values in the mineralized and non - mineralized areas are greater than 0 . 5 and do not show obvious differences .

From ( a ) to ( e ) , with the upgrade of mineralization intensity , the correlation dimensions increase and the exponents of lacunarity decrease .
These three sets could represent the same mineralization intensity but different continuities of orebody in potassium - silicate zone .
Despite these , the spatial distribution of ore - forming elements , which is the direct result of ore - forming process and thus the important medium for us to understand the process , has not been well addressed .
The multifaceted physicochemical controls of ore ï¬uid on metal precipitation include , among others , redox state and sulï¬dation state ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Zhong et al . , 2015 ) , density ( Rusk et al . , 2008 ) , salinity ( Rusk et al . , 2008 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) , composition especially the availability of li - gands ( chlorine and bisulï¬de ) ( Mao et al . , 2011a ; Seward et al . , 2014 ) , and pressureâtemperature ( Mei et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Zajacz et al . , 2011 ) .
Variations of the former three indices suggest that the core mineralized zone has more homogeneity , stronger compactness of high concentrations , and greater proportion of high concentrations in the Cu distribution compared to the other parts of the deposit .

Trends of exponent of lacunarity , correlation dimension and mineralization intensity for the five one dimensional sets with the same length , but different in the number of occupied sites and their spatial distribution ( revised after Plotnick et al . , 1996 ) .
The higher D2 denotes greater complexity of controls for the porphyry mineralization .

As the sulï¬dation state increases ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ) , ï¬uid temperature drops ( Mao et al . , 2011b ) and ï¬uid immiscibil - ity ( Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) would occur to precipitate metal with the proceeding of mineralization ( Guo et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2015 ) .
Variability of various fractal indices The Î²L , Îf ( Î± ) , D2 and H can portray the various aspects of the spatial distribution of ore - forming elements in a mineralized system .
The Hurst exponent proposed by Hurst ( 1951 ) has been widely used in geosciences ( Turcotte , 1997 ) to charac - terize the persistence and erratic feature of a system .
This interpretation from the fractal perspective is consistent with the geological understanding for the formation of porphyry deposits , which is considered to be subject to the complexity of ore fluid evolution with multifaceted physicochemical conditions .

This implies that greater complexity of controls , as reflected by higher correlation dimension , results in more stable orebody and more homogeneous elemental distribution , as indicated by lower exponent of lacunarity , in the core mineralized zone of the Pulang porphyry ore system .
The correlation dimension and multifractal spectrum from the multifractal domain were exten - sively used to various geological subjects , such as fractures ( Agterberg et al . , 1996 ; Arias et al . , 2011 ; Carranza , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) and geo - chemical data ( Wang et al . , 2007 , 2012a , 2012b ; Zuo and Cheng , 2008 ; Zuo et al . , 2015 ) .

This correlation between those two indices implies a genetic link , that is to say the greater complexity of controls results in a more homogeneous spatial distribution of Cu in the porphyry deposit .
More importantly , the correlation dimension , indicating the complexity of controls underpinning the system , is closely correlated to the exponent of lacunarity , which represents the homogeneity of spatial pattern .
We compared the variations of Î²L and D2 for ï¬ve constructed one dimensional datasets with the same length , but different numbers of oc - cupied sites , representing the precipitated metal and thus the mineral - ization intensity , and spatial distributions as shown in Fig . 11 .

To date , a few studies used remote sensing satellite data for lithological alteration mineral mapping in the Antarctica .
The Antarctic Peninsula ( AP ) ( Fig . 1 ) contains a variety of poorly exposed lithologies and areas that have not been directly mapped .
These bands were selected because bands 11 and 12 contain spectral emissivity and temperature information , whereas in band 13 surface temperature dominates the spectral emissivity information ( Yajima and Yamaguchi , 2013 ) .
Antarctica remains a remote and logistically difficult region to conduct geological field mapping and mineral exploration .
Moreover , there is good coverage of cloud and seasonal snow free over the AP providing a sound basis for remote sensing investigations .

In particular , the location of both the Christiansen maximum and the Reststrahlen minimum migrate to longer wavelengths as mineral and rocks become more mafic ( Hunt , 1980 ; Salisbury and D ' Aria , 1992 ; Sabine et al . , 1994 ; Hook et al . , 1999 ) .

Remote sensing satellite imagery has high potential to provide a solution to overcome the difficulties and limitations associated with geological field mapping and mineral exploration in Antarctic environments .
Qualitative image processing procedures such as RGB ( red , green , blue ) composites , band ratios and Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) were applied to ASTER bands for lithological mapping in the study areas .
The potential of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) multispectral remote sensing data was investigated by the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) for lithological mapping objectives and improving the coverage and overall quality of geological information in Antarctic Peninsula ( Haselwimmer et al . , 2010 ; .

Magnetite and hematite are common minerals in a range of mineral deposit types .

Magnetite occurs typically as an accessory mineral in many igneous rocks , but is locally concentrated by magmatic segregation or by crystal settling , forming magnetite - rich bands ( Deer et al . 1992 ) .
Iron oxides also form minor to trace minerals in a large number of deposit types , including Ni - Cu - PGE magmatic massive sulfides , Cu - Zn - Pb VMS , Opemiska - type Cu veins and clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits ( Leach et al . 2010 ) .

Apatite is another mineral that has been shown to have chemical composition characteristic of its formation environment ( Belousova et al . 2002 ) , which has been used for detrital sediment provenance studies ( Morton and Yaxley 2007 ) .
Zincian spinel composition depends not only on the chemical composition of the rocks , but also on the temperature of metamorphic equilibrium ( Heimann et al . 2005 ) .
Partitioning of trace and minor elements in iron oxides Iron and titanium minerals have been widely used as a thermo - oxybarometer based on Fe2 + + Ti4 + for 2 Fe3 + 332 Fig . 13 SEM backscattered elec - tron images of sample RX168 from the McCready East Sudbury Ni - Cu deposit .
Vanadium partitioning , in contrast , is decreasing with higher oxygen fugacity , and has a higher mineral - liquid partition coefficient in magnetite ( ~ 0 . 4â1 . 5 ) than clinopyroxene ( Toplis and Corgne 2002 ) .
Partitioning of Ni and Co in spinel is less dependent on temperature or oxygen fugacity than on the spinel composition ( Righter et al . 2006 ) .
Magnetites from carbonatite typically contain trace amounts of Zn , Cr , Ni , Co , Zr , Hf , Nb , Ta , Ga ( Reguir et al . 2008 ) .
Partition of Zr , Nb , Ta , and Hf between magnetite and mafic to intermediate silicate melts is strongly controlled by the Ti and Al content of magnetite ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
Partition of Zr , Nb , Ta , and Hf between magnetite and mafic to intermediate silicate melts is strongly controlled by the Ti and Al content of magnetite ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .

Partition of Zr , Nb , Ta , and Hf between magnetite and mafic to intermediate silicate melts is strongly controlled by the Ti and Al content of magnetite ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
HFS elements are more incompatible relative to Ti in magnetite at lower temperature and / or lower pressure ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
Magmatic partitioning of trace elements in magnetite is a complex function of melt composition , temperature , pressure , oxygen fugacity , and major element composition of the magnetite .
Magnetite crystallized from evolving silicate , carbonatitic or sulfide melts will incorporate a range of trace elements , from divalent metals such as Ni , to HFS elements .
Synthetic magnetite , doped in minor to trace amounts of Cr , Mn , Co , Ni , Cu , La , Nd , and Gd , is commonly precipitated from low temperature ( < 300 Â°C ) solutions to produce magnetite nanoparticles ( Diamandescu et al . 1998 ; Wang et al . 2009 ) .

In detrital sedimentary rocks , iron oxides are the most common heavy minerals ( Pettijohn et al . 1987 ) .
In hematite , Carew ( 2004 ) found that Ti , Si , Mg , Al , Co , Ni , As , Sn , Sb , Zr , V , Mn , W , Sc , Ga , and Nb were all detected whereas La , Mo , Ce , In , Hf , Bi , Pb , U , and Cu were commonly close or below detection limit .

The average concentrations of several elements ( e . g . , Ni ) , typical magmatic deposit types , are however significantly higher from those of other types of mineral deposits ( Fig . 2 ) .
The average concentrations of several elements ( e . g . , Ni ) , typical for magmatic deposit types , are however significantly higher from those of other types mineral deposits ( Fig . 2 ) .
At high temperature ( 600â 800 Â°C ) , Mn , Zn , Cu , and Cd are strongly partitioned in the chloride solution relative to Fe , and the divalent metals partitioning in the chloride solution increases with lower temperature ( Ilton and Eugster 1989 ) .
If low temperature BIFs have low average Mn , this is also found in magmatic Cr and V deposits ( Fig . 2 ) , thus showing that several physico - chemical parameters other than temperature , such as hydrothermal solution composition , pH , and oxygen fugacity , are impor - tant parameters that control partitioning of trace elements in hydrothermal iron oxides .

The zincian spinel gahnite is a common accessory mineral in amphibolite to granulite metamorphic zinc - bearing rocks rich sulfides ( Spry and Scott 1986 ; Heimann et al . 2005 ) , and can be used as an exploration tool for metamorphosed VMS deposits ( Spry and Scott 1986 ; Heimann et al . 2005 ) and Broken Hill - type Ag - Pb - Zn deposits ( Walters et al . 2002 ) .
The VMS deposits studied comprise examples formed in four of the five lithotectonic settings recognized for this deposit type ( Franklin et al . 2005 ) , range in age from Archean ( ex . Ansil ) to Recent ( ex . ODP Mound ) , and have been affected by sub - greenschist to amphibolite metamorphism .
The Ni - Cu massive sulfide examples represent various geologic settings from the Sudbury district , to dykes in anorthosite complexes ( Voiseyâs Bay ) , to subvolcanic intusions ( ex . Katiniq , Pipe ) .
The iron oxide compositional data we present in this paper is entirely derived from mineralized rocks , such that it cannot be compared to the composition of iron oxides from rocks barren of mineralization , which is a subject of ongoing research .
The electron microprobe is a widely available instrument that allows fast , efficient , and low - cost analysis of iron oxides for application to mineral exploration .
The chemical composition of iron oxides magnetite and hematite can be used to fingerprint mineral deposit types as shown by several studies ( Carew 2004 ; Gosselin et al . 2006 ; Singoyi et al . 2006 ; Beaudoin et al . 2007 ; Rusk et al . 2009 ; Nadoll et al . 2009 ) .
These divalent cations have small ( Mn ~ 1â4 ) to moderate ( Ni ~ 20â100 ) magnetite - liquid partition coefficients ( Toplis and Corgne 2002 ) .
Taking Mn as an example , our data show no systematic trend in average Mn content of iron oxides and the temperature of formation of the mineral deposit types investigated .
In the Kerimasi carbonatite , magnetite becomes depleted in Mg with magma evolution whereas Mn is shown to be more compatible with increasing oxygen fugacity , in contrast to vanadium ( Reguir et al . 2008 ) .
In the Kerimasi ( Tanzania ) carbonatite , magnetite becomes depleted Mg with magma evolution whereas Mn is shown to be more compatible with increasing oxygen fugacity , in contrast to vanadium ( Reguir et al . 2008 ) .
Only two elements ( Co and Ga ) have concentrations that are too low for analysis by Miner Deposita ( 2011 ) 46 : 319â335 333 EMPA .
The use of iron oxide mineral chemistry to fingerprint mineral deposits is not unlike the well - known use of spinel in petrogenetic studies ( Barnes and Roeder 2001 ) , as well as the use of indicator minerals for diamond exploration ( Fipke et al . 1995 ) .
Knowledge of trace element partitioning between iron oxides and hydrothermal solutions is even less well understood .
Based on the trace element composition of magnetite from selected VMS , skarn , IOCG , and Broken Hill - type clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits from Australia , Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) concluded that magnetite incorporates trace elements that are typical for a specific deposit type .

In addition , major and minor element composition of spinel records processes of high to low pressure crystallization and crustal contamination ( Barnes and Roeder 2001 ) .
Similarly , the Al / ( Zn + Ca ) vs . Cu / ( Si + Ca ) diagram can be used to separate Cu - Zn - Pb VMS deposits from other deposit types .
Partitioning of Ni , Ca , Co , and Mn between mafic melt and magnetite is independent of oxygen fugacity ( Toplis and Corgne 2002 ) .
Variations in the whole rock chemical environment in which magnetite grows control its chemical composition ( Hutton 1950 ; Buddington and Lindsley 1964 ; Scheka et al . 1980 ; Razjigaeva and Naumova 1992 ; Deer et al . 1992 ) .
These minerals form partial to complete solid solutions with magnetite , chromite , and spinel series , and ulvospinel as a result of divalent , trivalent , and tetravalent cation substitutions .
As an example , the IOCG deposits investigated comprise the most prominent examples of this class such as Olympic Dam , Ernest Henry , and Candelaria , which range in age from Proterozoic to Mesozoic .
In addition to forming iron ore in various types of sedimentary ironstones , iron oxides are abundant in iron oxide - copper - gold ( IOCG ) and Kirunatype apatite - magnetite , Fe - Ti , and in various types of porphyry and skarn deposits .

They concluded that the difference in magnetite chemistry likely results from mineral equilibrium assemblage at the site of magnetite deposition ( Rusk et al . 2009 ) , and that these chemical differences may be a useful pathfinder for orebodies in various geologic settings ( Nadoll et al . 2009 ) .
Other diagrams such as the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or the Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V are not discriminant for Ni - Cu - PGE and VMS deposits , but are useful to distinguish IOCG from Kiruna - type , porphyry Cu , BIF , skarn , and Fe - Ti - V deposits .

Consequently , the range in physico - chemical conditions during formation in various mineral deposit environments probably controls the chemical composition of iron oxides in mineral deposits , such that this compositional variety can possibly be used to fingerprint mineral deposit types ( Carew 2004 ; Gosselin et al . 2006 ; Singoyi et al . 2006 ; Beaudoin et al . 2007 ) .

It is noteworthy that eight elements out of ten that have concentrations commonly above the detection limit using the LA - ICP - MS ( Mg , Al , Ti , V , Mn , Ni , Zn , and Sn ; Singoyi et al . 2006 ; Rusk et al . 2009 ) also yield accurate and precise results using the electron microprobe method used in this study ( Table 1 ) .
Moreover , 11 out of the 14 elements ( Ti , Si , Al , Mg , V , Cr , Mn , Ni , Cu , Zn , Sn ) detected in magnetite using the LA - ICP - MS method by Carew ( 2004 ) are also measured using EMPA method , whereas only three elements measured by Carew ( 2004 ) are not detected by EMPA .

According to Carew ( 2004 ) , trace element patterns for Kiruna - type deposits from Sweden and Chile are different from those of the Cloncurry district IOCG mineralization , as also shown here in Figs . 2 , 5 , and 6 .
We cannot plot our data in the Sn / Ga vs . Al / Co discriminant diagram because Ga and Co are not measured with the EMPA .
Comparison with other studies of iron oxides LA - ICP - MS analyses have lower detection limits , and a wider range of minor and trace elements can thus be analyzed and used in studies of the chemical composition of iron oxides from ore deposits and their hostrocks ( e . g . , Carew 2004 ; Singoyi et al . 2006 ; Rusk et al . 2009 ; Nadoll et al . 2009 ) .
Discriminant diagrams such as the Ni + Cr vs . Si + Mg diagram for Ni - Cu - PGE deposits , and the Al / ( Zn + Ca ) vs . Cu / ( Si + Ca ) diagram for VMS and clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits are useful to distinguish these types of deposits .
Rusk et al . ( 2009 ) observed that magnetite from barren breccias is enriched V and depleted in Mn relative to ore - related magnetite from Ernest Henry , and concluded that the difference in magnetite chemistry probably results from mineral equilibrium at the site of magnetite deposition .

Using contoured data density plots of about 26 , 000 spinels , Barnes and Roeder ( 2001 ) were able to outline fields typical of various maficultramafic rocks .
Representativeness of the dataset In this study , some deposits ( for example , Windy Craggy or Reko Diq ) or types of deposits ( for example Ni - Cu massive sulfides ) have been studied in more detail than other deposits or deposit types ( Table 2 ) .
According to Nadoll et al . ( 2009 ) , the fact that only subtle geochemical differences were observed can be explained by the low temperature of formation of the orebodies and the metamorphic history of the Belt terrane , resulting in sub - solidus re - equilibration of hydrothermal magnetite .
Metamorphism is known to yield compositionally homogeneous , low - Ti magnetite ( Hall and Fischer 1977 ; Johnson 1979 ) , and metasomatic reactions in metamorphosed volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits yields gahnite in equilibrium with its host rocks ( Heimann et al . 2005 ) .

The discriminant diagrams presented in this paper can be used to identify a mineral deposit type according to magnetite or hematite compositions , but the reference database is composed of magnetite and hematite sampled from mineralized rocks only .

A set of discriminant diagrams has been devised that enables distinction of a wide range of mineral deposit types using a multi - step approach that is most efficient for fingerprinting a mineral deposit based on its iron oxide composition .
Other deposit types are less well represented with only a few deposits studied , for example , four BIF and two clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits have been investi - gated so far , such that our knowledge of the composition of iron oxides in these less well - documented deposit types remains preliminary .
Despite extensive experimental evidence and theoretical modeling , significant uncertainty remains on the calibration of the thermo - oxybarometer at temperature below 600 Â°C and for oxides with minor concentration ( < 6 wt . % ) of Al2O3 , MgO , MnO , and Cr2O3 ( Sauerzapf et al . 2008 ) .

EMPA spot analyses have a higher spatial resolution ( < 10 Î¼m ) compared to lower spatial resolution for LA - ICP - MS analyses ( > 50 Î¼m ) such that EMPA analyses are less susceptible to contamina - tion by small inclusions in the mineral of interest .

Magmatic water contents decrease from early - ( 3 . 5â4 . 6 wt % ) to late - stage ( 2 . 8â3 . 5 wt % ) amphibole , which is interpreted to indicate fluid exsolution from the magma chamber during emplacement of the Yulong intrusion .
Plagioclase phenocrysts show periodic or reverse core - to - rim zonation of An contents ( range up to 25 mol % ) , which are coupled by FeO contents , probably suggesting magma recharge events .

Textural and compositional variations of silicate mineral phenocrysts ( amphibole , plagioclase ) suggest that the magma chamber beneath Yulong ( 7 . 1â12 . 5 km in depth ) might have been recharged by a mafic magma , and was saturated in magmatic fluids at the time of emplacement of the Yulong intrusion ( 4 . 0â5 . 6 km in depth ) .
The periodic changes in magma compositions are most possibly resulted from pulsed recharge of the magma chamber by a less evolved magma ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Andrews et al . , 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .

The An contents vary periodically or conversely from plagioclase cores to rims , and are coupled by FeO contents ( Fig . 13A - C ) .
The magmatic oxidation states are high , and increase during magma evolution , which may have been essential to the enrichment of metals in the evolving magma .
The oxidation states are relatively high ( ÎNNO > 0 . 6 ) , and increase through magma evolution .
Their compositions are used to calculate crystallization depths , magmatic oxidation states , and water contents .

These high Î´18O values are typical of supracrustal input ( Cavosie et al . , 2005 ; Hawkesworth and Kemp , 2006 ; Kemp et al . , 2006 ) .
Although partial melting of sources of these alkalic - rich igneous rocks has been attributed to asthenospheric upwelling ( e . g . , Zhang and Xie , 1997 ) , the cause of asthenospheric upwelling remains controversial . Several models have been 22 / 58 suggested that efficient hybridization between mafic and felsic magmas could only happen under the conditions of high temperature and intense magma convection in depth ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) .

Caculated crystallization depths indicate that the early - stage amphibole may have crystallized in the underlying magma chamber ( 7 . 1â12 . 5 km ) , whereas the low - Al amphibole has crystallized in the porphyry stock ( 4 . 0â5 . 6 km ) .

The elevated oxygen fugacity will suppress early formation of Cu - rich sulfides , and thus will be favorable for metal transportation and enrichment during magma evolution and emplacement ( Mungall , 2002 ; Jugo et al . , 2005 ; Richards , 2015 ) .
Origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains a matter of debate .
Origin of the Yulong intrusion are classified as oligoclase ( An10 - 20 ) to andesine ( An40 - 50 ) .
However , the high whole - rock SiO2 ( 66 . 3â69 . 5 wt % ) and low MgO ( < 1 . 24 % ) contents and Mg # values ( < 46 ) argue against its origin by direct partial melting of the lithosphere mantle ( Baker , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) .
The relatively high oxidation states allow the metals to be enriched in the evolving magma , and to be deposited in the hydrothermal alteration stage .
It has been The Yulong intrusion has broadly similar zircon U - Pb ages ( ~ 41 . 0 Ma ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Huang et al . , 2019b ) and geochemical features with the alkaline felsic magmatic rocks along the strike - slip faults in eastern Tibet and western Yunnan ( i . e .
Therefore , the partial melting of ancient - and juvenile crustal components at Yulong was probably triggered by crustal scale extension and upwelling of the asthenosphere along the strike - slip faults in eastern Tibet ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ) , caused by India - Asia collision at about 65â55Ma ( Fig . 14AâB ; Chung et al . , 1997 ; Leech et al . , 2005 ; Mo et al . , 2007 ; Journal Pre - proof Hu et al . , 2015b ) .
To the west , the north Qiangtang terrane is separated from south Qiangtang terrane by the Permian - Triassic Zuogong - Jinghong arc ( Fig . 1B ) .
Furthermore , the late - stage amphiboles have higher magmatic oxygen fugacities ( e . g . , ÎNNO values ) than the early - stage amphiboles ( Fig . 12D ) .
Despite a mass of whole rock geochemical and zircon Hf isotopic studies , origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains controversial . Major disputes include partial melting of the ancient subduction - metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or the juvenile mafic arc lower crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) .
Furthermore , the Yulong intrusion has mainly elevated zircon Î´18O values of 6 . 4 to 7 . 6â° ( Figs . 8D and 9A ; average = 7 . 0 Â± 0 . 5â° , 2Ï , n = 79 ) .
This study presents new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes , and mineralogical chemistry of the Yulong intrusion .
Replenishment in the magma chamber Plagioclase phenocrysts from Yulong show large variation of An contents of up to 25 mol % ( Fig . 13A - C ; Appendix Table A5 ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal 3 / 58 precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
This indicates that the Yulong intrusion should not have Journal Pre - proof originated from the lithospheric mantle , but most likely from the juvenile mafic lower crust .
It is separated from the Songpan - Ganze terrane by the Permian Jiangda - Weixi arc , which is product of the subduction of the Jinshajiang Ocean ( a branch of the Paleo - Tethys ocean ) during Permian - Triassic ( Fig . 1B ; Hou et al . , 2003 ; Zi et al . , 2012a ) .
This suggests that these mafic lavas are unlikely to have been the parental magma of the Yulong intrusion , because fractional crystallization of a mafic magma generally produce felsic magmas with higher REE and LILEs contents ( e . g . , Rollinson , 1993 ) .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant between zircon ÎµHf ( t ) and Î´18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .

This probably indicates a heterogeneous source of the Yulong intrusion , consisting mainly of a juvenile mafic lower crust with positive ÎµHf ( t ) values and an ancient crustal component with negative ÎµHf ( t ) values and high Î´18O values .

This is possibly caused by late - stage fractionation or fluid exsolution process , 24 / 58 Journal Pre - proof as the caculated fO2 values are negatively correlated with water contents ( Fig . 12D ) .
The depleted source of the Yulong intrusion is probably a juvenile mafic lower arc crust , as suggested by the arc - like trace element patterns ( Fig . 7A - B ) and positive zircon Hf isotopes and young Hf mantle model ages ( Figs . 8C , and 10 ) .
Origin of these ore - forming porphyries , however , remains a matter of debate .
Considering the fact that the Cenozoic alkaline magmatic rocks ( including the Yulong intrusion ) are distributed strictly along the NW - SE strike - slip faults , we prefer the later model that asthenospheric upwelling was induced by regional decompression caused by strike - slip faults .
It has been suggested that the Yulong intrusion originated directly from low - degree partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or formed by assimilation - fractional crystallization ( AFC ) of 19 / 58 Journal Pre - proof metasomatized mantle - derived melts ( Hou et al . , 2003 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .

Caculated water contents of the magma parental to the late - stage amphibole are lower than those of the early - stage amphibole , which may suggest fluid exsolution from the underlying magma chamber at the time of emplacement of the Yulong stock ( Fig . 12C ; Leng et al . , 2018 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) .
These large - scale ( 100Î¼m ~ ) An and FeO variations are unlikely to have been caused by simple changes in magma pressure / temperatures or by chemical diffusion ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Ustunisik et al . , 2014 ; Waters and Lange , 2015 ) , but probably reflect periodic changes in magma compositions ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Andrews et al . , 23 / 58 Journal Pre - proof 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) .
It is also noteworthy that a few magmatic zircons at Yulong have negative zircon ÎµHf ( t ) and high Î´18O values ( Figs . 8C - D , 9A , and 10 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) .
Collectively , we propose that the magma chamber beneath Yulong was recharged by a less evolved magma , and was saturated in fluids to produce intensive alteration and mineralization .
The caculated results show that the early - stage euhedral high - Al ( 5 . 87â8 . 51 wt % ) amphibole phenocrysts may have crystallized in the underlying magma chamber ( 7 . 1â12 . 5 km in depth ) , whereas the late - stage xenomorphic low - Al ( 3 . 47â4 . 87 wt % ) amphibole grains may have crystallized in the porphyritic stock ( 4 . 0â5 . 6 km ) .

It is widely accepted that relatively high magmatic oxidation states ( ÎFMQ > + 1 , where FMQ is the fayalite - magnetite - quartz buffer ; Mungall , 2002 ; Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2015 ) , high water contents ( > 4 wt . % ; Richards , 2011 ) , and high sulfur and halogen contents ( Streck snd Dilles , 1998 ; Chelle - Michou and Chiaradia , 2017 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) are all indispensable conditions for porphyry Cu mineralization .

Journal Pre - proof Journal Pre - proof Yulong intrusion may have originated from concurrent partial melting of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related juvenile lower arc crust and a small amount of ancient crustal materials .
Nonetheless , it should be noted that the magmatic oxidation states are high throughout the magmatic evolution ( ÎNNO > 0 . 5 ) , which is consistent with the conclusion based on zircon trace element compositions ( Liang et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .
In this contribution , 4 / 58 we present new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes of the ore - related Yulong intrusion , with the aim of providing new evidences for the origin of the postsubduction Yulong deposit .
An alternative explanation for origin of the Yulong intrusion is the fractional crystallization of a mantle - derived mafic magma .
In addition , the relatively low contents of highly compatible elements ( e . g . , Cr ) and low Mg # values at Yulong are comparable to those of thick lower - crust derived adakite - like rocks ( Fig . 6B - D ) , which also indicates its origin from partial melting of the thickened lower crust ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) .

These values are similar to average value of the global lower crust ( Î´18O = 7 . 0â° ; Kempton and Harmon , 1992 ) , but significantly higher than the values of mantle ( 5 . 3 Â± 0 . 6â° , 2Ï , Valley et al . , 1998 , 2005 ) , and higher than the magmas that predominately derived from fractional crystallization of mantle - derived parental melts ( < 6 . 5â° ; Valley et al . , 2005 ) .
This indicates that they may have formed in similar geodynamic setting .
Several models have been proposed to account for the paragenesis of these postsubduction porphyry deposits , which include partial melting of the lithosphere mantle that was metasomatized by previous slab - derived melts / fluids ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Gao et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ) , partial melting of the subducted oceanic slab ( Hu et al . , 2015a ) , and partial melting of lower crustal cumulates of early arc magmas ( juvenile lower arc crust ) ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004 , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 , 2015 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .

This interpretation is consistent with the conclusion based on periodic sulfur zonation in apatite crystals at Yulong ( Huang et al . , 2019b ) , and is also in agreement with the repeated exsolution of fluids ( Chang et al . , 2018 ) .

Caculated 2 / 58 grains from this study and published studies have mostly positive yet variable ÎµHf ( t ) values ( - 20 . 6 to + 12 . 2 ) and young Hf model ages that overlap those of the Paleo - Tethys ocean - related arc magmas .
Andesitic to rhyolitic magmas containing more than about 1 - 1 . 5 wt % dissolved H 2 O have more H 2 O than can be accommodated in hydroxyl sites of igneous minerals , so the rest migrates to country rocks or to the atmosphere during crystallisation .

Copper - ore - forming arc magmas that bind Si - O - Al tetrahera together to constitute the polymerised framework of the silicate melt ( Burnham 1979 ; Stolper 1982 ) .
Depolymerisation of the melt makes it more difficult for minerals such as feldspars and pyroxenes to assemble their crystal structures , so their saturation temperatures decrease with increasing OH content melt .
Orthosilicates such as olivine and zircon that use only silica monomers should rise in saturation temperature owing to increasing supply of monomers upon addition of the first few percent H 2 O to dry melt ( cf .
olivine - in curve in Figure 2 ) , but further increase in dissolved H 2 O dilutes the concentrations of all other chemical components of the melt and thereby depresses the saturation temperatures of all anhydrous minerals , including oxides such as chromite and titanomagnetite , as shown in Figure 2 .
Hydroxyl - bearing minerals such as hornblende and biotite rise in saturation temperature during dissolution of the first 5 - 6 wt % H 2 O in the melt , but with further additions of dissolved H 2 O , the dilution effect takes over , and saturation temperatures of hydroxyl - bearing minerals decline too ( Holloway 1973 ; Foden & Green 1992 ) .
Elements such as Al and Sr that partition strongly into plagioclase , but weakly into hornblende , should accumulate in residual melts until plagioclase eventually saturates .
Elements that partition strongly into hornblende , but not into plagioclase , should undergo strong depletions from residual melt as hornblende crystallises , e . g .
Tectonic disturbance may disrupt the magmatic plumbing system , causing volcanic vents and subvol - canic apophyses to relocate , with the result that succes - sive mineralisation pulses do not superpose to generate a large composite ore deposit .
If volcanoes undergo sec - tor collapse that redistributes the load on the underlying magma chamber , successive stocks and their mineralisa - tion shells may not be juxtaposed .
The late Eocene - early Oligocene ore belt ( Figure 1 ) developed during waning stages of a period of Cordilleran orogeny that appears to be related to the collision of Africa - Arabia with Eurasia , which closed the western Tethys , stalled the Afro - Arabian plate , and caused the full spreading rate on the mid - Atlantic Ridge to be transmitted as accelerated westward migration of the Americas , causing them to over - ride their Pacific - margin subduction zones and induce a period of low - angle subduction and Eocene orogenic deformation at latitudes from Montana to central Chile ( Silver et al . 1998 ) .
ARE COPPER - ORE - FORMING MAGMAS UNUSUALLY WATER - RICH ?
( 2 ) Hornblende precipitation begins at higher temperatures at lower - crustal depths than at upper - crustal depths .
( 3 ) Hornblende ' s advance in the crystallisation sequence with increasing pressure occurs at the expense of titanomagnetite ( as well as pyroxenes and plagioclase ) , because high - pressure hornblende can accommodate most of the Ti and all the Fe 3Ã¾ in a normal calc - alkalic composition ( at ÆO 2 around the nickel metal Ã¾ nickel - oxide buffer , in these experiments ) .
During metallogenic epochs in the ore belts farther north , hornblende usually arrived in the crystallisation sequence at a basaltic andesite or mafic andesite ( 54 - 59 wt % SiO 2 ) stage of magmatic differentiation , and pyroxene - bearing dacites and rhyolites are apparently absent .

If the subvolcanic âbatholithicâ magma body is relatively flat - topped and lacks major apophyses , then flow of the more buoyant , felsic , hydrous residual melt fractions along the roof may lack focus , with the result that only widely distrib - uted , subeconomic mineralisation is produced .
The two Neogene ore provinces along the west side of the Neogene - Quaternary Altiplano uplift and along the west side of the Sierras Pampeanas Neogene thrust and fold belt are coincident in time and space with latitude intervals of strong orogenic deformation by agents illustrated in blue .
So , the ratio V / Sc can be expected to rise with rising SiO 2 in very hydrous mafic - to - felsic differentiation series ( Loucks 2000 ) .
Where the roots of arcs are exposed at various localities around the world , lowercrustal layered ultramafic - mafic cumulate complexes provide evidence of arc magmas stalling and crystallising at high pressure for long periods ( e . g .

Values of Sr / Y > 35 and V / Sc > 32 . 5â0 . 385  wt % SiO2 at 58â70 wt % SiO2 are typical of arc magmas parental to magmatic - hydrothermal copper ore deposits at conver - gent plate margins throughout Phanerozoic time , accord - ing to my compilation of compositions of ore - forming intrusions in 135 deposits .
South of El Teniente , the Southern Volcanic Zone in the latitude interval 35 - 47 S has been magmatically active but metallogenically unproductive for copper throughout the Cenozoic .
Changes in the crystallisation order of these minerals , equivalent to those shown in Figure 2 The conclusion from Figure 2 is that whole - rock element ratios that reflect the modal ratio of plagioclase / hornblende segregated from the magma during differentiation up to the stage sampled should reflect the hydration state of the magma .

Thus , in more hydrous mafic - to - felsic magmatic differentiation series , the ratios Al 2 O 3 / TiO 2 and Sr / Y in wholerock analyses may be expected to rise more strongly with rising SiO 2 , whereas these ratios may be expected to remain flat or decline with rising SiO 2 in weakly hydrous or dry mafic - to - felsic differentiation series ( Loucks 2000 ) .

Explanations of copper metallogenic provinces must invoke processes that transcend chemical heterogeneity in local environments .
For the purpose of mineral exploration , it is not necessary to discriminate the component of the chemical signal owing to elevated H 2 O content from the component of the signal owing to elevated pressure and orogenic compressive stress .
At high contents of dissolved H 2 O in the melt , hornblende can saturate before titanomagnetite ( Figure 2 ) and can deplete the melt of Fe 3Ã¾ as well as Fe 2Ã¾ and thereby delay and suppress production of magnetite .

At high contents of dissolved H 2 O in the melt , hornblende can saturate before titanomagnetite ( Figure 2 ) and can deplete the melt Fe 2Ã¾ and thereby delay and suppress production of magnetite .
V 4Ã¾ has a very high magnetite / melt partition coefficient on the order of 10 times larger than the hornblende / melt partition coefficient ( Luhr & Carmichael 1984 ; La Tourette et al . 1991 ) , so to the degree that hornblende supplants titanomagnetite as a sink for Fe 3Ã¾ in very hydrous melts , vanadium can avoid much of the depletion from the melt that occurs in drier magmatic differentiation series .
Saturation curves for magnetite and orthopyroxene in the hydrous melts are based on lower - temperature experiments by Blatter & Carmichael ( 1998 ) .
Chemical screening of whole - rock analyses to identify arc segments , individual igneous complexes within them , and stages in the evolution of long - lived magmatic centres that match the chemical features of copper - ore - forming arc magmas , is one of two principal criteria that exploration geologists should apply to selection of geologically favourable target regions .
A clue to the origin of magmatic fertility for copper ore genesis is given by the distribution of hornblende along the southern and central Andes .

FIRST - ORDER CONTROLS ON COPPER FERTILITY OF ARC MAGMAS
Most , if not all , major porphyry CuâMo deposits are composite ore bodies produced by overlap of several pulses of mineralisation from a succession of juxtaposed stocks .
At P H2O Â¼ 0 ( dry ) , the crystallisation order of silicates from the cooling melt is plagioclase first , followed by olivine , orthopyroxene and then augite .
Sillitoe ( 1998 ) noted that crustal thickening associated with compressive tectonism was synchronous with the formation of giant porphyry copper systems in central and northern Chile , southwest Arizona , Irian Jaya and Iran .
North and south of Arica , the trench - parallel components of the plate - convergence vectors have opposing directions that converge to produce compression that has caused crustal thickening and uplift of the Altiplano region ( Dewey & Lamb 1992 ) and oroclinal bending by more than 30 during the past 20 Ma ( MacFadden et al . 1995 ) .
The relative - motion vectors of the Nazca and South America plates ( 78 - 81 mm / yr ) are from DeMets et al . ( 1990 ) .
Figure 1 shows the distribution of late Paleogene copper ( AE gold AE silver AE molybdenum ) - bearing magmatichydrothermal ore deposits in the central Andes .
These ratios may be used to screen whole - rock chemical analyses to identify igneous complexes that may contain undiscovered copper ore . Magmatic fertility , as represented by these chemical features , is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for an igneous complex to produce a major porphyry or high - sulfidation magmatic - hydrothermal copper deposit .
Rohrlach & Loucks ( 2005 ) used the plagioclase / melt geohygrometer calibration of Rohrlach & Loucks ( 2000 ) to demonstrate that ore - stage dacitic magmas that produced the giant Tampakan highsulfidation and porphyry Cu ( - Au ) deposits in southern Mindanao had accumulated $8 wt % dissolved H 2 O by inheritance through several cycles of magma - chamber replenishment and fractional crystallisation .
The second crite - rion is targeting arc intervals that have experienced recent compressive orogenic deformation in the lead - up to the magmatic activity being assessed .
Striking examples include : the rich porphyry copper provinces that developed ca 66 - 54 Ma in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico ; the string of porphyry - copper deposits that formed ca 42 - 31 Ma in northern Chile ; the many gold - rich magmatichydrothermal deposits that formed during the Miocene epoch in northern Chile ; and the swarm of copper and gold deposits that developed between 5 and 1 Ma in arcs bordering the western margin of the Philippine Sea Plate and along the New Guinea - Solomons - Fiji interval of the southwestern Pacific Plate ( Sillitoe 2010 , and references therein ) .
can it be explained by serendipitous subduction of local compositional anomalies in the oceanic lithosphere such as volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits or serpentinised fracture zones .
It is enigmatic that large segments of some arcs become richly mineralised during a brief epoch , but preceding and succeeding igneous activity in the same region produced little or no copper ore .
Any model that purports to explain the origins of magmatic fertility for generating magmatic - hydrothermal copper ore deposits along convergent plate margins must account for : ( 1 ) the tendency of deposits to cluster in metallogenic belts and epochs that are transient in space and time within much more extensive and longerlived convergent - margin magmatic belts ; and ( 2 ) the distinctive lithophile - element chemical characteristics of copper - ore - forming arc magmas relative to ordinary arc magmas .

Figure 2 illustrates how increasing the content of dissolved H 2 O in a silicate melt affects the crystallisation sequence of minerals .
These expectations will be tested for relevance to copper - ore - forming arc magmas in a following section .
( 1 ) At 0 . 1 GPa ( upper blue horizontal band ) , plagioclase is the second silicate to begin crystallising , whereas at 1 . 3 GPa ( lower blue horizontal band ) , plagioclase is among the last ; residual felsic liquid of dacitic composition can precipitate ultramafic cumulates on the magma chamber floor .
Each black dot represents an experiment in which the crystallising mineral assemblage was identified by Moore & Carmichael ( 1998 ) , and the melt ' s content of dissolved H 2 O ( dotted grey contours ) was determined from the composition of the quenced glass according to the method of Moore et al . ( 1998 ) .
It is therefore likely that the transient provinciality of copper metallogeny along convergent plate margins is due to geodynamically imposed variations of tectonic stress , which in turn affect the depth at which magmas are trapped and chemically differentiate by fractional crystallisation ( Loucks 2000 ; Loucks & Ballard 2002 ; Rohrlach 2002 ; Rohrlach & Loucks 2005 ) .
My survey of the extensive literature on petrology of late Cenozoic igneous centres in the unmineralised Southern Volcanic Zone of Chile finds that the latitude interval 35 - 45 S contains a larger proportion of basalts , and corroborates the report by Hildreth & Moorbath ( 1988 ) that its andesites and dacites are nearly all pyroxene - rich and hornblendepoor or - absent .

Formulation of whole - rock element - ratio proxies for the hydration state of magmas can be assisted by reference to experimental studies that show how varying the hydration state of a magma affects the crystallisation sequence of minerals and hence the relative rates of depletion or enrichment of major and trace elements in the residual melt during cooling and crystallisation at any given pressure .
It is useful to exploration geologists to be able to infer the hydration state of arc magmas from commonly reported major and trace elements in published wholerock analyses .
At P H2O > 350 MPa and > 6 . 5 wt % H 2 O dissolved in the melt , plagioclase is the last of those silicates to crystallise , and hornblende is first .
In the following sections , tests are made whether the element ratios Al 2 O 3 / TiO 2 , Sr / Y and V / Sc are effective in discriminating copper - ore - forming intrusions from ordinary arc magmas in apparently unmineralised arc segments .
Squares are gold - rich intermediate - and high - sulfidation epithermal deposits and porphyry gold ( - copper ) deposits ; circles are porphyry copper ( AE gold AE molybdenum ) deposits .
It is evident from its transient provinciality that magmatic fertility for copper metallogeny cannot be explained by serendipitous crustal contamination scenarios , such as assimilation of limestone , redbeds , coal or sulfidic black shales .

Figure 3 illustrates the experimentally determined effect of pressure variation on the crystallisation sequence of minerals at constant bulk composition ( including constant bulk H 2 O content ) during solidification of a magnesium - rich tholeiitic basaltic parental melt at any given depth .

It is striking that the latitude interval 19 - 26 S that was richly productive of giant porphyry coppers in the late Eocene has continued to be magmatically active up to the present time , but has been metallogenically unproductive for the past 25 Ma , whereas the latitude interval 29 - 34 S that was magmatically active but metallogenically unproductive in the Paleogene became richly productive of copper and gold - copper deposits in the Neogene .
The H 2 O Ã¾ or loss - on - ignition in a whole - rock chemical analysis does not represent the water content of hydrous magmas from which the rock crystallised , so the hydration state of magmas must be assessed from thermodynamic analysis of mineral - melt equilibria , such as the plagioclase / melt hygrometer ( Housh & Luhr 1991 ; Rohrlach & Loucks 2000 ; Lange et al . 2009 ) or inferred qualitatively from whole - rock element ratios .
So , it is apparent that increasing pressure up to about 1 GPa has essentially the same effect on the relative stabilities of plagioclase , hornblende and titanomagnetite as the effect of increasing the content of dissolved H 2 O in the melt .
Calculations by Loucks ( 2000 ) , Loucks & Ballard ( 2002 ) , Rohrlach ( 2002 ) , and Rohrlach & Loucks ( 2005 ) indicate that magmas ascending from the asthenospheric mantle wedge into a lithospheric regime of horizontal compressive stress during orogeny , have difficulty propagating dykes to the upper crust and are likely to stall at or near the Moho , where basaltic magmas lose much of their buoyancy at the density discontinuity between dense mantle peridotite and less - dense lower - crustal mafic granulites or gabbros .

Compressive tectonic environments , thickened continental crust , and active up - lift and erosion were associated with the formation of many of these deposits .

Volatiles from the ridge may cause metasomatism of the mantle wedge , possibly accompanied by an increased sulfur flux due to subduction of metalliferous sediments in pressure shadow zones behind highs on the downgoing plate .
Ore grades are also partly dependent on the structure ( permeability architecture ) of the district ( leaky versus focused hydrothermal fluid - flow regimes ) , and formation and preservation of supergene enrichment blankets can also be critical to high - grade ore formation .

The deposits are characterized by low - grade copper , gold , and / or molybdenum mineralization developed within and around a porphyritic intrusive complex .
Many calc - alkalic porphyritic intrusions have also produced giant gold - rich porphyries .
These giant deposits are clustered within three provinces , central Chile , northern Chile , and southwest Arizona - northern Mexico .
For the Iran - Pakistan segment of the Tethyan belt , it is difficult to comment on the plate architecture and geodynamics at the time of ore formation , and a similar problem exists for Frieda River on mainland Papua New Guinea , which formed at 13 . 6 to 11 . 5 Ma ( Table 2 ) , making it significantly older than the in - teraction of the Eupirik Rise with the New Guinea trench .

A low - grade geochemical anomaly may be the final product of mineralization , if ore - forming processes do not operate effi - ciently , even in the most favorable geodynamic settings .
Buoying of the subducting slab by aseismic ridges , seamount chains , and / or oceanic plateaus can provide environments that are favorable for porphyry ore formation .

The productivity of the Andean and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya fold belts , in terms of porphyry ore formation , has been a consequence of factors that operated effectively at crustal to mantle and district and deposit scales .
He inferred that the flat slab was related to an elongate swell and associated oceanic plateau related to the ancestral Yellowstone hot spot .
Interaction of these oceanic plate features with subduction zones probably best explain multiple metallogenic cycles of porphyry ore formation in a given region , as typified by the Chilean Andes , where five porphyry metallogenic belts occur in a region where subduction has otherwise continued unabated since the Cretaceous ( Sillitoe , 1988 ; Camus , 2002 ) .

From the perspective of porphyry exploration , two vital questions that need to be addressed are : why and how have giant , high - grade porphyry deposits formed ?
Other factors , such as sutures in the overriding plate , permeability architecture of the upper crust , efficient processes of ore transport and deposition , and , in some cases , formation and preservation of su - pergene enrichment blankets are also vital for the development of high - grade giant ore deposits .

In several examples , these tectonic perturbations have promoted flat - slab subduction , crustal thickening , uplift and erosion , and adakitic magmatism coeval with the formation of well - endowed porphyry and / or epithermal mineral provinces .
Of these , six of the seven giant copper and nine of the 13 giant gold deposits are known or inferred to be associated with regions where low - angle subduction of aseismic ridges , FIG .
While most of the available isotopic , fluid , and melt inclusion evidence points toward a preponderance of magmatic - de - rived fluids in porphyry systems ( e . g . , Davidson et al . , 2005 ; 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 815 Downloaded from http : / / pubs . geoscienceworld . org / segweb / economicgeology / article - pdf / 100 / 5 / 801 / 3459346 / 801 . pdf by China University of Geosciences Beijing user on 15 June 2021 816 COOKE ET AL .
The associated compressional tectonism , rapid uplift , and exhumation ( potentially leading to the superposition of porphyry and epithermal environments ) reactivation of basement faults , and a hiatus in volcanism associated with crustal thickening would favor the formation of porphyry copper deposits ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Although not discussed here , sutures in the overriding plate obviously play vital roles in focusing magmatism and fluid flow ( e . g . , Richards , 2000 , 2003 ; Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .

Of the remaining deposits , the gold - rich Tampakan deposit may be associated with subduction of the Snellius plateau and occurs in a region of the Philippines where adakitic volcanism has occurred ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ) , an association that also occurs in other provinces where ridges have been subducted .
The associ - ated compressional tectonism , rapid uplift , and exhumation ( potentially leading to the superposition of porphyry and ep - ithermal environments ) reactivation of basement faults , and a hiatus in volcanism associated with crustal thickening would favor the formation of porphyry copper deposits ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Of these , six of the seven giant copper and nine of the 13 giant gold deposits are known or inferred to be associated with regions where low - angle subduction of aseismic ridges , 814 COOKE ET AL .
Large - scale factors ( e . g . , geodynamics , lithological , and structural archi - tecture ) have constrained total metal endowments by provid - ing effective fluid pathways and controlling the generation , location , nature and size of fluid reservoirs , as well as the tim - ing and manner of release of stored fluids .
This may lead to the generation of oxidized melts that can transport copper , gold , and sulfur dioxide from the mantle to the upper crust ( e . g . , Richards , 2003 ) .
Possible mechanisms of high - grade hypogene mineralization are discussed in other papers contained within this special issue .
They are most commonly discovered in continental and oceanic arcs of Tertiary and Quaternary age , notably around the Pacific Rim , but they have also been discovered in ancient fold belts .
This may lead to the genera - tion of oxidized melts that can transport copper , gold , and sul - fur dioxide from the mantle to the upper crust ( e . g . , Richards , 2003 ) .
Other ongoing controversies regarding porphyry systems that are discussed in this volume include the relative importance of cooling ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , hy - drothermal alteration ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , and fluid mix - ing ( e . g . , Frikken et al . , 2005 ) for deposition of high - grade ore in porphyry systems , the relative importance of ridge subduc - tion and flat subduction in the formation of giant porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ) , the nature and origin of copper mineralization at the largest of the Andean deposits , El Teniente ( e . g . , Skewes et al . , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , the duration and timing of magmatic - hydrothermal activity ( e . g . , RÃ­o Blanco - Los Bronces : Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; El Teniente : Maksaev et al . , 2004 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , and the relative importance of strike - slip , compressional and extensional tectonism during the formation of the Eocene - Oligocene porphyry belt of northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ) .
More than half of the 25 largest known porphyry copper deposits , defined in terms of contained copper metal , formed during three time periods : the Paleocene to Eocene , Eocene to Oligocene , and middle Miocene to Pliocene .
This period spans the formation of the Eocene to Oligocene porphyry province of northern Chile , the most productive on Earth in terms of copper content ( Camus , 2002 ) .

Murphy ( 2001 ) argued that the Laramide orogeny in the southwest United States was associated with flat - slab subduction , because it was characterized by an absence of volcanism , widespread hinterland deformation , and thick - skinned tectonics .

As we have al - ready shown , the Andean and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya fold belts host some of the worldâs largest and highest grade porphyry deposits and have been subjected to several cycles of mineral endowment during episodes of convergent margin tectonism ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1988 ; Camus , 2002 ) .
Bold arrows indicate the direction of relative plate motions .
The processes that generated and maintained the physicochemical gradients ( temperature , pressure , salinity , acidity , redox , and reduced sulfur ) required to form elevated hypogene ore grades remain poorly understood and continue to be debated .
by reviewing the characteristics of the 25 largest porphyry copper deposits , defined in terms of contained copper and gold - rich porphyry deposits ( in terms of contained gold ) , and by examining their occurrences in space and time .
A number of factors may play a role in the formation of porphyry systems during ridge subduction .
Harris et al . , 2005 ) , there are data from individual deposits that are not readily explained by a purely orthomagmatic model for ore formation and probably require input of exter - nal fluids during the mineralizing processes ( e . g . , Frikken et al . , 2005 ) .
It is the favorable conjunction of many factors , from the crustal to the deposit scale , which appears to result in the formation of the giant deposits .

We highlight the spatial coincidence of many of the world ' s largest porphyry systems in Tertiary to Quaternary magmatic arcs with regions where subduction of submarine ridges , oceanic plateaus , and seamount chains has occurred and speculate on the importance of these tectonic " triggers " ( defined here as perturbations to the steady - state conditions of subduction ) for porphyry - style mineralization .
Similarly , as discussed above , James and Sacks ( 1999 ) argued that southern Peru and northern Chile was the site of flat - slab subduction from 50 to 30 Ma .

Both questions are addressed in papers contained within this issue on the giant , porphyry - related mineral deposits of the Andean and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya fold belts .
Whereas the total metal endowment may relate to these large - scale processes , the ore grades relate mainly to the hypogene ore - forming processes operating at the trap site .

This review and subsequent papers in the special issue show that the produc - tion of major deposits in a terrane is commonly limited to dis - crete epochs ( e . g . , Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Pollard et al . , 2005 ) , implying that fluid production and / or re - lease is episodic and linked to the geodynamic evolution of the terrane .
Overall , the aim of the special issue is to help explorers and researchers better understand how and where processes of ore formation have combined effectively to produce some of the worldâs largest high - grade hypogene porphyry copper and gold resources .
Over one hundred years of exploration and research has provided an excellent understanding of their geology and geochemistry .
Scope of this Issue This issue of Economic Geology reports the results of new research into the characteristics and origins of porphyry cop - per - molybdenum and copper - gold deposits of Chile , Ar - gentina , and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya .

Furthermore , CambroâOrdovician granitic plutons in the Baoshan Terrane represent the evolution of the Australian Proto - Tethyan Ocean , providing important evidence for the location of an early Paleozoic granitic belt that extended along the northern margin of the Gondwana supercontinent ( Chen et al . , 2007 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Dong et al . , 2013a , b ; Wang et al . , 2015a ) .

If this is correct , the Late Triassic associated copper deposits formed during or after arc - continent collision followed by slab break - off and upwelling of hot asthenosphere at ~ 216 Ma , not during active westward - directed subduction .
We therefore suggest that the Paleo - 24 Tethys Ocean isolated the Baoshan Terrane from the Simao Terrane with a distinct paleobiogeography province .
Wu ( 2015 ) suggested that the Late Triassic porphyries are related to partial melting of a juvenile lower crust induced by upwelling of the asthenosphere in a post - subduction setting .
The high TDM c values correspond to metamorphic rocks and are interpreted to reflect the presence of a long - lived Paleoproterozoic crustal block ( Yunnan BGMR , 1990 ) .

This is similar to the scenarios elsewhere that porphyry copper deposits do not typically form above " active " W - directed subduction zones , whereas they typically form during or immediately after crustal shortening / thickening such as in circum - Mediterranean and circum - Pacific belts ( Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Doglioni et al . , 1999 ; Doglioni et al . , 2007 ; Doglioni and Panza , 2015 ; Nimis and Omenetto , 2015 ) .

At least three ( northern , central and southern ) segments of the JinshajiangâAilaoshan tectonic belt have been recognized as zones containing porphyry deposits ( Deng et al . , 2014a ) .
Furthermore , variable positive to negative ÎµHf domains are distributed between three high - ï¥Hfâlow TDM c domains along the JinshajiangâAilaoshan tectonic belt ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) , which correspond to Late Triassic granodioritic intrusions and associated skarn Cu mineralization .

Despite some disagreement , most researchers prefer the mechanism involving the removal of the lower lithospheric mantle along the JinshajiangâAilaoshan Suture , which acted as a mechanically weakened lithospheric discontinuity ( Lu et al . , 2012 , 2013a , b , 2015 ; Deng et al . , 2014b ) .
Based on the ï¥Hf and TDM c domains identified in our study , we suggest that the Longmu TsoâShuanghu and ChangningâMenglian sutures mark an important Hf isotopic boundary that divides the region into two distinct parts with an old , reworked , crustal block to the southwest , and a juvenile crustal block to the northeast ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .

This suggests the presence of an old , reworked crustal component , whereas the ~ 42 km thick crust in the South China Craton has high - Hf and low TDM c values suggesting the presence of a juvenile crust component for the magmatic rocks there ( Fig . 10 aâc ) .
This suggests the presence of an old , reworked crustal component , whereas the ~ 42 km thick crust high - Hf low TDM c values suggesting the presence of a juvenile crust component for the magmatic rocks there ( Fig . 10 aâc ) .
The isotopic data support the former interpretation , which is further supported by the following lines of evidence : ( 1 ) The N - trending ChangningâMenglian Suture contains an ophiolitic mÃ©lange , magmatic - arc rocks , and associated deep - water sedimentary rocks .
High Sr , Sr / Y and La / Yb values , and low Y and Yb values , variable zircon ÎµHf ( â4 . 5 to 27 + 3 . 6 ) and medium TDM c ages ( 1300 to 900 Ma ) and zircon Î´18O values of 6 . 63 to 7 . 83â° characterize potassic intrusions associated with Eocene - Oligocene porphyryâskarn Cuâ Au mineralization ( Table S1 ; Lu et al . , 2013b ) .
Porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits are commonly associated with intermediate composition arc - related igneous rocks with high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) ratios , and such rocks are equated by some researchers with melts derived from subducted oceanic crust undergoing eclogite facies metamorphism ( âadakitesâ ) .
Partial melts of hydrated oceanic crust in subduction zones ( slab melts , or " adakites " ) are thought to have high Sr / Y ratios because of the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase in basaltic rocks undergoing eclogite facies metamorphism ( Kay , 1978 ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ) .

Unradiogenic Sr isotope compositions furthermore indicate that continental crustal components , which could generate " adakite - like " trace element signatures , were not present in the source .

Primary basaltic arc magmas must first escape from the asthenosphere and then pass through the upper plate lithosphere as they ascend toward the surface , resulting in fractionation and interaction with the surrounding rocks .

Such rocks share many of the major and trace element characteristics of adakites , but are demonstrably not slab melts ( e . g . , Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ) .

Such partial melts will also have trace element signatures indicative of residual garnet , and will impart a high - La / Yb and Sr / Y signature to the melts with which they mingle ( Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Haschke et al . , 2002 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ; Baziotis et al . , 2008 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ) .

Hornblende stability in magmas requires relatively high H 2 O concentrations ( â¥4 wt % ; Naney , 1983 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) , and titanite stability reflects relatively high magmatic oxidation states ( Foley and Wheller , 1990 ) , both of which are common characteristics of arc magmas worldwide ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .

Metals therefore remain in the magma until they are partitioned into exsolving hydrothermal fluids .
Highly oxidized slab melts ( due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration ) might cause oxidation of chalcophile metal - bearing sulfide phases in the mantle wedge , with the subsequent release of the now - incompatible metals to the silicate melt phase ( Mungall , 2002 ) .

Arc magmas with high water content will crystallize large amounts of amphibole Â± garnet during early differentiation in deep crustal MASH or hot zones ( up to 90 % amphibole ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) , and will therefore evolve to high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) compositions , with listricshaped REE patterns ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ) .

Evidence for high magmatic water content can in fact be recognized even without recourse to trace element wholerock analyses : fertile , hydrous magmatic suites should contain amphibole or biotite phenocrysts , or evidence of pseudomorphs ( hornblende phenocrysts commonly break down at low pressures ; Browne and Gardner , 2006 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) .
High water content is a prerequisite for the forma - tion of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits ; thus , this para - meter can be used to evaluate the prospectivity of arc mag - matic suites .

If deep crustal ( MASH zone ) magmatic systems need time to evolve to more hydrous compositions , then this may explain why many major porphyry epochs form late in the history of a given arc , commonly after several million years of largely barren magmatism ( Richards , 2003 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009b ) .
The enhanced fertility of arc magmas relates pri - marily to their high water content , which is required for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal systems upon shallow crustal emplacement .
The stability of garnet causes the heavy rare earth elements ( HREE ) such as Yb ( and Y ) to behave compatibly relative to the light rare earth elements ( LREE ) such as La , leading to high La / Yb ratios ( â¥20 ) .
The oxidation state and sulfur content of the magma may affect the metal endowment and metal ratios in ores precipitated by the hydrothermal system ( Richards , 2005 ( Richards , , 2011 ) , but will not affect whether a magmatic - hydrothermal system forms or not .
under eclogite facies conditions , rather than melting of overlying mantle wedge ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) .
During MASH interactions , arc magmas may assimilate partial melts of lower crustal rocks , which in mature continental arcs likely include garnet amphibolites ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) .
Thus , arc magmatic suites with high Sr / Y ratios and evidence for the presence of hydrous phenocryst phases ( hornblende and / or biotite ) are indeed prospective for porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits , but only because these parameters indicate high magmatic water content .
But in more mature oceanic arcs or continental arcs , they typically stall at density barriers in the mantle or at one or more levels in the crust , where they undergo wall - rock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) , or MASH processes ( melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Annen et al . , 2006 ) , leading to the development of intermediate composition calcalkaline magmas .

At root , arc magmas are fertile sources of magmatic - hydrothermal ore - forming systems because ( 1 ) they are hydrous , and will therefore exsolve a water - rich volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust ( Burnham , 1979 ) , and ( 2 ) they are relatively oxidized ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Candela , 1992 ) .
Although high Sr / Y magmas can also be generated by source melting processes where garnet is present , there is no obvious reason why such magmas should be especially fertile for sub - sequent ore formation .
However , high sulfur content and oxidation states alone will not result in the exsolution of an aqueous volatile phase : high magmatic water content is the sine qua non of magmatic - hydrothermal ore - forming systems .

Relatively water poor magmas may also evolve to more hydrous compositions by fractionation of anhydrous silicate minerals ( Wallace , 2005 ) .
Stalling of mafic magmas in the mantle or at the base of the crust results in the crystallization of ultramafic to gabbroic cumulates in which garnet is a common early fractionating or residual phase ( Hamilton , 1981 ; DeBari and Sleep , 1991 ; MÃ¼ntener et al . , 2001 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Macpherson , 2008 ; Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Coldwell et al . , 2011 ) .

In addition to garnet , hornblende , titanite , and zircon also preferentially partition middle - REE ( MREE ) and HREE , and their fractionation will generate magmas with progressively increasing La / Yb and Sr / Y ratios ( Sisson , 1994 ; Klein et al . , 1997 ; Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Bachmann et al . , 2005 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) .

Metallogeny of slab melts ( adakites )
In addition to water , slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur ; when generated by flat subduction with associated compressional stress in the upper plate , these magmas might be trapped as non - erupting , closed - system , upper - crustal plutons , where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being vented to the surface as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ) .

Specifically , high Sr / Y ratios in intermediate composition arc magmas should not be uniquely equated with an origin by slab melting , and extending this link to porphyry ore formation is unwarranted .
Instead , these mineralogical signatures reflect variables such as temperature , pressure , oxidation state , and water content in magmas , either during their formation or ascent .
Consequently , the high Sr / Y ratios in some intrusive rocks associated with porphyry deposits have been taken as an indication that the parental magmas were slab melts , and that such magmas are uniquely fertile for porphyry ore formation upon emplacement in the upper crust ( ThiÃ©blemont et al . , 1997 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .

This leads to the formation of andesitic to dacitic differentiates with HREE - depleted normalized REE patterns , and consequent high La / Yb and Sr / Y ratios ( Fig . 1 ; Feeley and Davison , 1994 ; Kay et al . , 1999 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ) .

Thus , relatively hydrous , oxidized arc magmas will fractionate toward andesites and dacites with adakite - like trace element ratios ( Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ; Rooney et al . , 2011 ) .
Thus , while not all arc magmas may be sufficiently hydrous to efficiently form magmatic - hydrothermal systems upon emplacement in the upper crust , a variety of tectonic and magmatic processes can be envisaged that might generate such high magmatic water contents .

If it is accepted that high magmatic water content is essential for porphyry deposit formation , then this single factor very simply explains the commonly observed association between ore deposits and intrusive rocks with high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) ratios .

An additional effect of high magmatic water content is the suppression of plagioclase crystallization relative to hornblende ( Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; MÃ¼ntener et al . , 2001 ) , resulting in early increases in Sr content , and weak or absent Eu anomalies on normalized REE diagrams ( Fig . 2 ) .

The disagreement lies in the different sources proposed for these magmas , the implications that these different models have for plate tectonic settings conducive to porphyry ore formation , and the consequences for mineral exploration strategies .

However , it is the case that magmas with high Sr / Y ratios can be derived by several postmelting magmatic processes , including the following : ( 1 ) fractionation or equilibration with garnet in deep crustal reservoirs , ( 2 ) contamination with deep crustal partial melts , and ( 3 ) fractionation of hornblende Â± titanite Â± zircon .

This observation should mean that postmelting magmatic processes are evaluated first before considering the evidence for source characteristics , but this first step is commonly omitted when identifying slab melts on the basis of high Sr / Y ratios alone .
A positive correlation between these trace element ratios and SiO 2 ( as a measure of fractionation ) should be observed , and is exactly what is found in many porphyry - related magmatic suites ( Fig . 2 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009b ) .
The latter parameter ensures that the bulk of the sulfur dissolved in the magma is present in oxidized forms , and the tendency to saturate extensively in sulfide phases , which could remove chalcophile and siderophile elements from the magma , is low ( Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ) .

An alternative explanation , however , is that normal , hydrous , oxidized arc magmas derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge above the subduction zone , can evolve to these " adakite - like " trace element compositions by fractionation of normal phenocryst assemblages such as hornblende Â± garnet Â± titanite ( Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a , b ) .

Along with mineralogical evidence for the presence of hydrous phenocryst phases ( hornblende and / or biotite ) , and geochemical evidence for extensive frac - tionation , this parameter is most simply interpreted to reflect high magmatic water content , which results in hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization .

The reasons for this variability may reflect factors such as subduction rate ( i . e . , the rate at which water is subducted and devolatilized from the downgoing slab ; van Keken et al . , 2011 ) , subduction of sea - floor anomalies , such as aseismic ridges , seamounts , or fracture zones ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; RodrÃ­guez et al . , 2007 ; Parman et al . , 2011 ) , or location of magmatism relative to the main arc axis ( Wallace , 2005 ) .
On these points , there is no dispute between the proponents of slab melting and those of AFC processes for high - Sr / Y arc magma metallogeny .
Moreover , unambiguously identifying source characteristics from the trace element compositions of magmas that have evolved in open systems is notoriously diffi - cult , because later magmatic processes that inevitably occur ( such as crustal contamination and fractional crystallization ) will obscure such subtle source signatures .
However , simi - lar geochemical characteristics are readily developed in normal asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived magmas by fractionation of amphibole and / or garnet , and / or by interaction with crustal materials during ascent through the upper plate lithosphere .

This diversity of mechanisms indicates that there is no single , obvious reason for slab melts to have unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits .
In recent years , a number of authors have noted a link between intermediate composition plutonic rocks with relatively high Sr / Y ratios and porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits ( e . g . , Baldwin and Pearce , 1982 , and others cited below ) .
On the other hand , Macpherson et al . ( 2006 ) and Coldwell et al . ( 2011 ) have shown that deep fractionation of hydrous arc magmas can also occur in nascent arcs such as the Philippines ( where large porphyry deposits occur ) under the right conditions .
It is suggested that this might be the simplest firstorder indicator of the prospectivity of any given magmatic arc suite for porphyry deposit formation .
In this paper , I examine the logical arguments behind these two competing hypotheses for the origin of porphyry depositforming magmas , and conclude that , in the absence of direct evidence for a relationship between slab melting and ore formation , the simpler hypothesis involving demonstrable processes ( i . e . , fractionation and crustal contamination ) of hydrous arc magmas must be the preferred explanation .
old ) should therefore melt , but later authors have proposed that other localized conditions , such as shallow subduction ( Gutscher et al . , 2000 ) or plate edge melting in slab windows ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , may also give rise to adakites .
Indeed , Davidson ( 1996 ) has argued that the inevitability of some or all such open - system processes affecting magmas ascending through the lithosphere , and especially continental lithosphere , means that detecting unique source trace element signatures is effectively impossible .

The porphyry - related suites are hornblende - phyric , indicating relatively high magmatic water contents ( â¥4 wt % H 2 O ; Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) , whereas earlier barren suites are relatively dry ( plagioclasepyroxene - phyric ) .

Early and abundant fractionation of hornblende from these hydrous magmas ( Romick et al . , 1992 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; Rooney et al . , 2011 ) preferentially depletes the magma in MREE - HREE and Y , leading to listric - shaped REE patterns and low Y and Yb concentrations that decrease with SiO 2 ( as a measure of fractionation ) .

Porphyry deposits formed during the early to middle Miocene and Pliocene along this arc , and indeed may be actively forming today beneath large active stratovolcanoes such as Koh - i - Sultan ( and the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes along the extension of the Chagai arc into southeastern Iran ) .
Porphyry deposits may form at subvolcanic levels as a consequence of volatile exsolution from these batholithic magma chambers and the focusing of fluid flow through narrow cupola zones .
The porphyry - related suites are predominantly subvolcanic , with little coeval volcanism .
The high water content of these evolved magmas results in their greater tendency to be trapped in mid - to - upper crustal batholithic magma chambers ( 10 - 5 km depth ) , as opposed to being erupted at the surface , as is more typical for the earlier , geochemically more primitive and less hydrous volcanic sequences ( Winter , 2001 ; Miller et al . , 2003 ) .
For 40 Ar / 39 Ar analyses , a plateau segment is defined as consisting of three or more contiguous gas fractions having analytically indistinguishable ages ( i . e . , all plateau steps overlap in age Â± 2Ï analytical error ) and comprising a significant portion of the total gas released ( typically > 50 % ) .
If this flux of hot magma is maintained , then a large magma complex develops at the base of the crust ( the MASH zone ) , in which fractionation of the mafic magma and mixing with partial melts of crustal lithologic units gives rise to evolved , hybrid , calc - alkaline intermediate composition magmas , whose lower density allows them to rise into the upper crust .

Because convergent margins are commonly under a mildly compressional state of stress , crustal thickening may accompany the development of hot zones .
Fertile plutonic suites in continental arcs may be recognized by their relatively late timing with respect to voluminous plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric andesitic volcanism , the widespread presence of hornblende phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and trace element compositions featuring relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , and lack of negative Eu anomalies ( reflecting hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization ) .

The precursor tectonomagmatic processes described above are reflected in the geochemical compositions of " fertile " arc magmas as follows : 1 .
In all cases , a long - lived , mature arc setting is required for these fertile magmatic characteristics to be developed .

Suppression of plagioclase crystallization due to high magmatic water content ( Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; MÃ¼ntener et al . , 2001 ) results in relatively high Sr ( undepleted ) contents that only start to decrease with SiO 2 in felsic ( dacitic ) magmas .
Suppression of plagioclase crystallization due to high magmatic water content ( Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; MÃ¼ntener et al . , 2001 ) results in relatively high Sr contents that only start to decrease with SiO 2 in felsic ( dacitic ) magmas .
In each region , the late porphyry - related magmas are more geochemically evolved and more hydrous ( as evidenced by the presence of hornblende phenocrysts ) than the preceding volcanic rocks .
Together , these petrologic behaviors result in porphyryrelated rocks having relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which some have misinterpreted as a source characteristic arising from melting subducted oceanic crust ( i . e . , adakites ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Omrani et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .

They commonly contain hornblende and / or biotite phenocrysts , reflecting high magmatic water contents ( â¥4 wt % H2O ) .
Nevertheless , a large deposit is unlikely to form without these underlying precursors .
Further , a sustained magmatic flux from the asthenosphere is required to extend the thermal anomaly of arc magmatism into the upper crust , where large , relatively long - lived batholithic magma chambers and subvolcanic cupolas can develop .
The processes by which low - density bubbly magmas and / or separate volatile phases are focused in the apical parts of these fractionating batholiths to form cupolas , within which porphyry deposits may form ( under the right local magmatic , structural , and hydrothermal conditions ) , have been described by numerous authors and are not repeated here ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Samples analyzed by the 40 Ar / 39 Ar method at the University of Nevada Las Vegas were wrapped in Al foil and stacked in 6 mm inside - diam sealed fused silica tubes .
A similar late timing for porphyry mineralization is observed in other porphyry belts worldwide ( e . g . , northern and central Chile , PerÃº , and southwestern United States ; Richards , 2003 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ) .
Conversely , relatively dry magmas formed during early stages of arc evolution tend not to stall in the upper crust , but erupt effusively and do not generate large magmatic - hydrothermal systems or porphyry deposits .
Regional - scale changes in upper - plate stress conditions may also control the commonly observed pulsation of arc magmatism and the spatiotemporal nature of metallogenic belts ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Compared with earlier barren volcanoplutonic rocks , the porphyry - related suites are characterized geochemically by : relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which increase with SiO 2 ( where trends are visible ) ; minimal europium anomalies ( Eu n / Eu * â 1 ) ; and light REE enrichments , but flat to concave - upward ( listric - shaped ) MREE - HREE patterns , reflected in [ La / Sm ] n â 4 - 8 and [ Dy / Yb ] n â 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 .

It was formed during two major orogenic events , one in the earlymid Mesozoic reflecting closure of the Paleo - Tethys ocean , and the second in the early Cenozoic to Recent , reflecting closure of the Neo - Tethys ocean ( SengÃ¶r and Yilmaz , 1981 ; Glennie , 2000 ; Ilbeyli et al . , 2004 ) .
Subsequently , postcollisional alkaline magmatism has characterized the Pliocene - Quaternary period .
In contrast , earlier , barren magmas were relatively dry ( plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric ) .
Loaded tubes were packed in an Al container for irradiation .
Reliable isochrons are based on the MSWD criteria of Wendt and Carl ( 1991 ) and , as for plateaus , must comprise contiguous steps and a significant fraction of the total gas released .
The range of compositions of samples of volcanic rock from the Paleocene Juzzak Formation is shown for comparison ( gray field ) .
The temporal and geochemical evolution of arc magmatism that culminated in porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposit formation has been studied in three separate Neo - Tethyan arc systems in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan .
The ultimate evolutionary product of this magmatic flux is the voluminous exsolution of volatiles in the upper crust , but whether an economic porphyry deposit forms as a result of this fluid exsolution is a function of local - scale variables ( as noted above ) .
It is thus suggested that the fertility of arc magmas within a given arc terrane can be assessed by observing the relative timing of plutonic suites ( later suites are more prospective ) , noting the common presence of hornblende or biotite phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and through lithogeochemical fingerprinting of magmatic fractionation processes ( relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , and Eun / Eu * ratios â 1 , indicating abundant early hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization in hydrous magmas ) .

A hot zone ( Annen et al . , 2006 ) in the crust is progressively developed , whereby the flux of heat ( and mass ) from the mantle is convected upward through the crust toward the surface .
It is suggested that a prolonged period of arc magmatism ( perhaps several millions to tens of millions of years ) along the same crustal axis is necessary to establish a mature magma - processing ( MASH ) zone at the base of the crust , in which evolved , volatile - rich magmas can form .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
We suggest that this reflects maturation of the arc magmatic system over a period of tens of millions of years , leading to the generation of more evolved , volatile - rich magmas at later stages of the arc ' s history .
We interpret these data as reflecting increasing arc maturity and water content in progressively more evolved magma types , ultimately leading to the generation of magmas with sufficient water content to form magmatic - hydrothermal ( porphyry ) deposits upon upper crustal emplacement .
This process reflects the progressive interaction of hot , hydrous , asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived basaltic arc magmas with the upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the base of the upper plate crust , where these invading magmas stall due to their high density ( relative to crustal rocks ) .

Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the porphyry magmas and related rocks indicate that they are relatively evolved and fractionated significant amounts of hornblende prior to plagioclase crystallization as a consequence of high magmatic water contents .
Hence , a simple explanation for the fertility of the later evolved magmas is that their higher water contents resulted in plutonism rather than effusive eruption and , most critically from a metallogenic perspective , the generation of subvolcanic magmatic - hydrothermal systems that precipitated ore minerals .
Correction factors for interfering neutron reactions on K and Ca were determined by repeated analysis of K - glass and CaF2 fragments .
A similar temporal relationship is observed in other major porphyry districts worldwide , such as northern and central Chile , PerÃº , northwest Argentina , and southwestern United States ( Richards , 2003 ; Halter et al . , 2004 Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) .
These conditions result in progressive temporal changes in arc magmatism toward geochemically evolved andesiticdacitic magmas with high volatile ( especially H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and incompatible element contents , which are the essential starting ingredients for porphyry deposit formation ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Cline , 1995 ) .

These data are compared with published information from the Miocene Kerman porphyry belt of south - central Iran ( Hassanzadeh , 1993 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) .
In further contrast , in western Pakistan subduction of Arabian Sea crust beneath the Makran accretionary complex continues today , as evidenced by Pliocene - Quaternary calc - alkaline volcanism in the Chagai arc .
A diverse array of mineral deposit types is also associated with the belt , including volcanic - hosted massive sulfide deposits , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au deposits , and low and high sulfidation epithermal Au deposits .
In this paper we present lithogeochemical and geochronological data from Cenozoic arc - related volcanic and intrusive rocks from the Lut microcontinental block of eastern Iran and the Chagai belt of Pakistan , including rocks associated with the Eocene Shadan and Maher Abad porphyry deposits in Iran , and the Miocene Saindak and Reko Diq porphyry deposits in Pakistan .
They formed at a late stage in the development of the Urumieh - Dokhtar magmatic arc , following a major volcanic stage in the Eocene - Oligocene .
Total gas ( integrated ) ages are calculated by weighting by the amount of 39 Ar released , whereas plateau ages are weighted by the inverse of the variance .
An age of 28 . 02 Ma ( Renne et al . , 1988 ) was used for the Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine fluence monitor in calculating ages for samples .
A relatively simple model can be put forward to explain all of these temporal and geochemical relationships in terms of progressive maturity in long - lived magmatic arcs .
The diversity and transience of tectonic configurations during the evolution of this orogen has led to a complex geologic record , which in many sectors of the belt is not yet well understood .
For each sample , inverse isochron diagrams are examined to check for the effects of excess argon .
Irradiated FC - 2 sanidine standards together with CaF2 and K - glass fragments were placed in a Cu sample tray in a high vacuum extraction line and were fused using a 20 W CO2 laser .
Computer automated operation of the sample stage , laser , extraction line , and mass spectrometer , as well as final data reduction and age calculations , were done using LabSPEC software written by B . Idleman ( Lehigh University ) .
Despite different ages and current tectonic settings , similar igneous geochemical trends are observed in all three districts ( e . g . , increasing Sr / Y with time ) , and the timing of porphyry emplacement is late in each district ' s tectonomagmatic evolution .
As discussed by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) , Kay et al . ( 1999 ) , Richards et al . ( 2001 ) , Haschke et al . ( 2002 ) , and Richards ( 2003 , 2005 , when an arc axis remains static for a period of several millions of years , magmatism evolves from relatively primitive tholeiitic compositions ( immature island arcs or nascent continental arcs ) to evolved calc - alkaline compositions ( mature continental arcs ) , through processes described by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) as melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) .

The quartz - illite - pyrite alteration indicates that the deposit was immediately overlain by a weakly miner - alized , intensely altered , geochemically anomalous , poten - tially thick cap of quartz - illite and / or sericite - pyrite alteration similar to that now preserved mostly at the margins of the de - posit .
Geochronology of alteration min - erals along with paragenetically well - constrained studies of fluid inclusions and light stable isotopes will be particularly important in determining the temporal and genetic relation - ships between multiple stages of hydrothermal alteration and metal introduction and redistribution .

Notably , the Pebble deposit has the largest gold endowment of any porphyry deposit and , after the Muruntau deposit and the Witswatersrand basin , the third largest of all gold deposits .
Controls on hypogene grade and deposit geometry The high hypogene grades in the Pebble deposit at least par - tially reflect multiple stages of metal introduction ( Fig . 12 ) .

More locally , Pebble formed between strands of the Lake Clark fault zone ( Shah et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) .
The underlying Kaskanak batholith likely represents the source of the large volumes of fluids necessary to form Pebble ( Fig . 12 ; Richards , 2003 , 2005 ) , with ascent of these fluids controlled by both the brittle - ductile fault zone and the granodiorite cupolas .

The absence of hydrothermal breccias , except within the brittle - ductile fault zone , is compatible with vertical fluid confinement .
Most movement on brittle extension faults occurred after formation of Pebble ( Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) but near - coincidence in orientation of the ZG1 and brittle - ductile fault zone faults suggests that they may have a much longer history marked by episodic reactivation ( S . Goodman , pers .

The preference of alter - ation and mineralization for the sills suggests that the intense hornfels in Kahiltna flysch acted as aquitards and that deposit geometry may reflect a significant component of lateral fluid flow ( Fig . 12B ) , as documented in some porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 1997 ) .

The several pulses of mineralizing fluids at Pebble may , however , be related to discrete intrusive phases located below the limit of drilling ( Fig . 12 ) or reflect evolving fluids derived from a single source that , over the life - time of the hydrothermal system , reutilized pathways along structures and / or the exposed granodiorite cupolas .
The late overprint by advanced argillic alteration may therefore reflect fluid confinement rather than telescop - ing ( e . g . , Khasgerel et al . , 2009 ) , which is also consistent with formation at shallow paleodepth ( Tracy , 2001 ; see below ) .

The spatial coincidence of al - kalic and subalkalic intrusions at Pebble and their emplace - ment within a short time span are also intriguing in light of models which propose that recharge of subalkalic magma chambers by primitive mafic magmas may influence the for - mation of some gold - enriched porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Keith et al . , 1997 ; Hattori and Keith , 2001 ) ; although there is cur - rently no evidence that addresses this potential interaction it is a potential topic for future study .

Regional relationship between magmatism and porphyry mineralization The age of Pebble implies that mid - Cretaceous ( 97â90 Ma ) intrusions might be preferentially prospective for world - class porphyry deposits in southwest Alaska .

As noted above , rare examples of vein xenoliths within , and vein truncations by , granodiorite plutons suggest the potential for multiple early mineralizing events .
This setting is similar to fertile porphyry environments in northern Chile and suggests that southwestern Alaska is highly prospective for porphyry exploration .
This setting was likely critical to emplacement of large magmatic bodies that were sources of fluids at depth and multiphase cupolas emplaced at shallow paleodepth , along with maintenance of plumbing sys - tems that focused fluid flow .

One possible scenario comprises an earliest substage of Cu - Au - ( Mo ) mineralization associated with biotite - rich al - teration in the host rocks to granodiorite plutons and a later substage of Cu - Mo - ( Au ) mineralization related to K - feldspar - enriched alteration within and proximal to the granodiorite plutons ( Fig . 12B , C ) .

was tilted 20Â° to the east , ( 15 ) Pleistocene to Recent glacia - tions removed most of the paleosupergene mineralization and dispersed components of the deposit downice , and ( 16 ) the glaciers retreated by about 11 Ka and minor supergene min - eralization formed .
As an alternative , variations in the ratio of biotite to K - feldspar in early potassic alteration and the relative concentrations of molybdenum versus gold may reflect the influence of host - rock composi - tion , which is consistent with smooth patterns of vein density that cross lithologic contacts .
This discussion develops a provisional magmatic - hydrothermal - structural model which accommodates most relationships currently recognized at Pebble .
Recent deep drilling indicates that the granodiorite intrusions either merge at depth or intersect underlying Kaskanak batholith , as sup - ported by magnetic data ( Shah et al . , 2011 ) and recent petro - graphic studies ( Olson , pers .
A structurally controlled to pervasive , advanced argillic lithocap related spatially to the brittle - ductile fault zone is also plausible above the East zone .

Bedding is subparallel and normal - facing in both the Kahiltna flysch and the overlying Cover sequence , which was potentially deposited < 6 m . y .
These rocks were intruded between 99 and 96 Ma by coeval granodiorite and diorite sills , followed shortly thereafter by alkalic monzonite intrusions and related breccias .
This scenario is consistent with the upward flar - ing of late sericite alteration ( Fig . 12D ) and zones of early high - density quartz veins , which in the north zone ( NQV ; Fig . 5 ) has a distinct base at depth .
Hornfels related to the Kaskanak batholith formed prior to hydrothermal activity at Pebble and is most intensely developed in flysch .
In southwest Alaska , how - ever , the common association of porphyry deposits with Late Cretaceous intrusions ( Young et al . , 1997 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) demonstrates that mid - Cretaceous intrusions were not uniquely fertile .
The po - tentially significant but unquantified gap in time between ad - vanced argillic alteration and early potassic alteration suggests that advanced argillic alteration is more plausibly related to a concealed intrusion at depth along the brittle - ductile fault zone ( Fig . 12D ) .
A similar situation has not thus far been conclusively identified at Pebble .
These centers are elongated par - allel to the Lake Clark and similar strike - slip faults and are in - terpreted to be the deep roots of a Cretaceous arc .

The West zone extends from surface to ~ 500 - m depth and is centered on four small granodiorite plutons emplaced into flysch , diorite , and granodiorite sills , and alkalic intrusions and breccias .
A more complete ge - netic model that addresses the near - surface signature of the Pebble system will be a significant aid to exploration for por - phyry targets under the extensive Eocene and glacial cover which characterizes much of southwest Alaska .
It comprises the East and West zones , which are approximately equal in size , with slightly lower grade mineralization in the center of the deposit where the peripheries of the two zones merge .
The West zone was discovered in 1989 by Cominco America ( Bouley et al . , 1995 ) and contains moderate hypogene grades of Cu - Au - Mo mineralization overprinted by thin , partially developed supergene mineralization .
The much higher grade East zone extends to at least 1 , 700 - m depth and is hosted by a larger granodiorite pluton and adjacent granodiorite sills and flysch .
The East zone was discovered by Northern Dynasty Minerals in 2005 ( Rebagliati and and contains high - grade hypogene mineralization without a supergene overprint .

It comprises the East and West zones , which are approximately equal in size , with slightly lower grade mineralization in the center of the deposit where the peripheries of the two zones merge .

Significant modifications to this provisional model can be anticipated as additional , more detailed studies are com - pleted at Pebble , although many details of the Pebble deposit will likely remain poorly constrained until three - dimensional mine exposure is achieved .
An understanding of its principal characteristics will be valuable in developing exploration strategies in this highly prospective , underexplored region , which is extensively covered both by Eocene rocks which were deposited after the formation of known porphyry deposits and by glacial sediments .
The Pebble project is currently in the prefeasibility stage and is being advanced by the Pebble Limited Partnership , an equal - rights venture formed in 2007 between subsidiaries of Anglo American plc and Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd . We herein present a general overview of the Pebble deposit .
The Boyongan and Bayugo porphyry Cu - Au mineral deposits , discovered under postmineralization cover during the previous decade , are part of an emerging belt of intrusion - centered Au - rich Cu mineral deposits and prospects in the Surigao district of northeast Mindanao , Philippines .
Debris flows , volcanic material , and fluviolacustrine sediments accumulating in the actively extending Mainit graben subsequently covered the weathered deposits , preserving their supergene profiles .
Inter - and late - mineralization intrusions were emplaced as the magmatic - hydrothermal system waned .

Debris flows in the burial sequence above and adjacent to the Boyongan / Bayugo complex also contain abundant clasts with intense , pervasive illite and alunite - pyrophyllite - dickite - kaolinite alteration assemblages that have overprinted K silicate - style quartz veins .
Debris flows in the burial sequence above and adjacent to the Boyongan / Bayugo complex also contain abundant clasts with intense , pervasive illite alunite - pyrophyllite - dickite - kaolinite alteration assemblages that have overprinted K silicate - style quartz veins .
Quartz - vein stockworks in the eastern high grade of Boyongan have been intersected over a vertical interval of 800 m , having affected much of the early - mineralization stock .
Truncated veins , vein - quartz xenoliths , and abrupt changes in vein abundance and grade at intrusive contacts all support a model for multiple discrete magmatic events during the evo - lution of the hydrothermal system ( Fig . 19 ) .
Vein quartz abundance and Cu - Au introduction attenuated progressively with successive magmatic - hydrothermal cycles associated with intermineralization ( intermineralization diorite porphyry and DIO3 ) and late - mineralization ( late - mineralization dio - rite porphyry and DIO4 ) intrusions .
Post - K silicate alteration The timing of magmatism K silicate alteration relative to the peripheral illite - chlorite - epidote - calcite assemblage within and beyond the pyrite halo remains unclear .
Veinlets of pyrite Â± chalcopyrite are common in sericite - clay - chloriteâ altered rocks , but in many deposits it is difficult to assess the importance of the sericite - clay - chlorite alteration in modify - ing the earlier Cu - Au mineralization introduced during K silicate alteration ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .

Vuggy quartz alteration in float resembling recognizable intrusions such as the birdâs - eye porphyry ( Fig . 25C ) also sup - ports the case for a quartz - alunite - clay overprint in the Boy - ongan / Bayugo complex , even though no such assemblage has been recognized in situ .

Vein stages 0â4 are associated with K silicate alteration and are described in the text . Line thickness is drawn proportional to the abundance of veining or intensity of alteration .
Lines for veins in red indicate principal stages are associated with Cu - Au introduction .
Clay mineral studies were not carried out at Bayugo , so the distribution of illite - smectite alteration is not depicted for this area .
Drilling at Bayugo has not yet defined the extent of veining and altera - tion , and the distribution depicted should be considered a minimum .

Physiographic recon - structions based on the topography of the paleosurface and on stable isotope paleoaltimetric constraints ( Braxton et al . , 2009 ) suggest that the weathering profiles of the two deposits formed in an environment of high topographic relief immedi - ately east of a prominent ( > 550 m ) escarpment at elevations between 750 and 1 , 050 m a . s . l .
Higher hypogene pyrite / chalcopyrite ratios at Bayugo likely led to greater acid production during weathering and more complete leaching of Cu above the base of oxidation .

These mineralized stocks are part of a multiphase diorite intrusive complex that includes a prem - ineralization early - diorite complex , the aforementioned dia - treme , and a series of early - , inter - , and late - mineralization porphyry intrusions .
In both mineral deposits , Cu and Au are associated with intense quartz - vein stockworks composed primarily of K silicate stage 3 veins .
Stage 2 veins consist of quartz with selvage and / or disseminated magnetite or biotite and K - feldspar halos .
Stage 3 quartz veins have K - feldspar halos but generally lack magnetite and biotite .
Stage 4 veins consist of massive bornite - chalcopyrite and chalcopyrite - pyrite with K - feldspar halos .
Stage 3 quartz veins and stage 4 sulfide veins host Cu - Au mineralization of the greatest volumetric significance , reflecting the general paucity sulfide in the earlier vein stages .
Existing geochronological constraints on the timing of magmatism and hydrothermal activity demonstrate that these repeated cycles supporting superior grade development transpired extremely rapidly , in a period of less than 200 , 000 years ( 2 . 3 - 2 . 1 Ma ) .

Detailed radioisotopic dating from these systems reveals that some alteration systems were contemporaneous or nearly so , suggesting a common ori - gin .
Thus the superior grades encountered in Boyonganâs eastern and western high - grade zones are attributed almost exclusively to hypogene processes .
Instead , sericitic alteration occurs more com - monly in narrow , structurally controlled zones as alteration halos to late pyrite - quartz Â± chalcopyrite Â± molybdenite veins ( âDâ veins of Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) or to quartz - calcite - pyrite - sphalerite - galena veins .

Within the diorite complex , the two mineral deposits are spatially distinct , separated by approximately 1 km of premineralization diorites .
Significant Cu and Au introduction followed these events and occurred in association with small early - mineralization diorite porphyry stocks at Boyongan and Bayugo .

Low hypogene pyrite / Cu sulfide ratios ( 0 . 6 ) at Boyongan contrast with more elevated ratios ( 2 . 3 ) at Bayugo ( Braxton et al . , 2009 ) .
As early as the late Pleistocene , transtensional movement along strands of the Philippine fault zone ( Fig . 1 ) contributed to local extension in northeast Mindanao .
Through absolute dating of igneous zircon from the earliest premineralization stocks and late - mineralization dikes these authors bracketed the timing and duration of magmatism and K silicate - stage alteration at Boyongan and Bayugo to between 2 . 3 Â± 0 . 1 and 2 . 1 Â± 0 . 2 Ma ( at 2s uncertainty ) .

However , hypogene Cu grades exceed 0 . 5 % by weight only in the upper 300 m of the stockwork ( in the cupola of the early - mineralization stock ) .

Where evidence of both K silicate quartz - alunite - clay alteration is preserved in the same rock , the quartz - alunite - clay assemblage formed later ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) , consistent with observations in the float samples from Bagacay and Magpayang .

The emplacement of this diatreme may have provided conduits for subsequent ascent of magmatic - hydrothermal fluids .
Superposition of these two magmatic - hydrothermal cycles in the shallow eastern high - grade zone at Boyongan is considered to account for the supe - rior hypogene grades ( locally exceeding 2 % Cu and 3 g / t Au ) in this area ( Figs . 7 , 11 ; App .
In a seminal study in the Pleistocene Mankayan district of northern Luzon , Arribas et al . ( 1995 ) demonstrated that age determinations for alunite associated with the Lepanto high - sulfidation deposit ( 1 . 6â1 . 2 Ma ) were indistinguishable from those for hydrothermal biotite ( 1 . 5â1 . 3 Ma ) and illite ( 1 . 4â1 . 2 Ma ) associated with the subjacent Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit .

A similar progres - sion of K silicate - related alteration and veining followed the emplacement of each synmineralization intrusion .
Timing and duration of the magmatic - hydrothermal systems Braxton et al . ( 2012 ) presented the results of a high - resolu - tion geochronological study on magmatism and hydrothermal activity at Boyongan and Bayugo .
The age determinations for illite and alunite in the current study show that this alteration immediately followed the final intrusive event .
Since their formation in the early Pleistocene , exhumation and weathering of these deposits have led to the development of a 600 - m - thick oxidation profile at Boyongan and a modest ( 30 - 70 m ) oxidation profile at Bayugo .
Since their formation in the early Pleistocene , the Boyongan and Bayugo mineral deposits were exhumed and subsequently buried beneath postmineralization cover in the active Mainit graben system .
Since their formation in the early Pleistocene , the Boyongan Bayugo mineral deposits were exhumed and subsequently buried beneath postmineralization cover in the active Mainit graben system .
In most of these cases , the quartz - alunite - clay alteration zone occurs above and is laterally displaced from the porphyry sys - tems ( e . g . , Far Southeast - Lepanto : Arribas et al . , 1995 ) .
In con - trast to many of the Cu porphyries of the American southwest and the Andes , broad ( > 250 m ) annular zones of intense ser - icitic alteration around a K silicate core are present in only a small proportion of the Philippine deposits ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .

These findings are consistent with porphyry emplacement , illite - pyrite alteration , and quartz - alunite - clay formation from a single evolving magmatic - hydrothermal system at Boyongan and Bayugo .

Braxton et al . ( 2012 ) presented geochronological evidence for subsidence rates exceeding 0 . 34 km / m . y .

These characteristics are similar in mineral - ogy and timing but greater in intensity than the illite - pyrite alteration assemblage developed at Boyongan .
That study pre - sented evidence for exhumation rates exceeding 2 . 5 km / m . y . , with weathering of the currently preserved paleosurface beginning by approximately 1 . 6 Ma .
The study illustrates the spectrum of metallogenic processes operative over a geologically brief period and highlights some of the key elements responsible for formation of superior grades and for deposit preservation in an extensional setting .
The history at Boyongan and Bayugo of porphyry emplace - ment ( from 2 . 3â2 . 1 Ma ) , exhumation ( by 1 . 6 Ma ) , supergene oxidation ( approaching 600 - m depth at Boyongan ) , and final burial ( by 1 . 6 ka ) attests to the geologically short time scales and transient geodynamic environments that can govern por - phyry formation and preservation .

Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) documented sulfide contents of > 5 % for the sericitic alteration zones in their Philippines study , with pyrite chalcopyrite ratios varying from 3 : 1 to 10 : 1 .
These authors described an assemblage of sericite ( fine - grained white mica ) , clay ( kaolinite and smectite ) , and chlorite that overprinted earlier K silicate alteration in more than half of the 48 Philippine porphyry systems that they studied .
Pat - terns emphasize the difference in wall - rock types between Boyongan ( breccia complex ) and Bayugo ( early diorite complex ) .
Pat - terns emphasize the difference in wall - rock types between Boyongan ( breccia complex ) Bayugo ( early diorite complex ) .
In the immediate vicinity of Boyongan , a high permeability contrast between the diatreme breccia complex and the surrounding wall rocks , coupled with the proximity of the breccia complex to the escarpment to the west , is inferred to have led to a depressed groundwater table and a vertically extensive unsaturated zone .
These characteristics suggest that limited acid - generating capacity at Boyongan , essential for supergene Cu remobilization ( e . g . , Emmons , 1917 ; Locke , 1926 ; Blanchard , 1968 ; Sillitoe , 2005 ) , promoted largely in situ oxidation of Cu - bearing sulfides and modest supergene remobilization of Cu .
Despite this association , not all of these quartz - vein stockworks contain Cu and Au to the same tenor .
With the industry turn - ing ever more toward exploration under cover , the nuanced understanding of the anatomy , processes , pathways , and envi - ronments of porphyry formation and preservation derived from such studies will contribute to the concepts guiding future discovery .
At Boyongan and Bayugo , intense and pervasive illite alteration , in association with pyrite , chalcopyrite , and tetrahedrite - tennantite , developed in narrow structures crosscutting quartz - K - feldspar veins .
The spatial and temporal relationships between intrusive activity , veining , and alteration presented in this study demon - strate the intimacy of magmatism and Cu - Au mineralization at Boyongan and Bayugo .
At Boyongan , there is no evidence to suggest that fluids responsible for illite - smectite - chlorite alteration had any measurable impact on the concen - tration or distribution of Cu or Au .
These pro - cesses culminated in final burial of the Boyongan and Bayugo deposits beneath fluviolacustrine and volcanic facies of the Tugunan Formation by 1 . 6 ka ( App .

Positioned farther from the escarpment and outside the diatreme brec - cia complex , Bayugoâs vadose zone was commensurately restricted .
Exploration following the emerging genetic link between epithermal Au and porphyry Cu deposits led to the discov - ery of two porphyry Cu - Au mineral deposits ( Boyongan and Bayugo ) concealed beneath postmineralization cover in the Surigao Au district .
Exploration following the emerging genetic link between epithermal Au porphyry Cu deposits led to the discov - ery of two porphyry Cu - Au mineral deposits ( Boyongan and Bayugo ) concealed beneath postmineralization cover in the Surigao Au district .
During its geologically brief exposure , a 600 - m - thick supergene profile developed at Boyongan , this being the deepest pervasive oxidation profile of any porphyry system described to date ( Braxton et al . , 2009 ) .
This paper provides a detailed geologic description for these deposits and their evolution in this emerging Cu - Au district .
Figure 26 summarizes the lateral and temporal distribution of veining and alteration events that characterized the evolution of fluid conditions within the intrusive complex . Magmatic - hydrothermal cycles and superior grade development Although the early diorite stocks ( birdâs - eye porphyry , medium - grained diorite porphyry , and fine - grained diorite porphyry ) may have formed in association with some early formed calc - silicate alteration , these intrusions appear to have acted primarily as passive hosts to mineralizing fluids introduced during the emplacement of the synmineralization intrusions ( early - mineralization diorite series , intermineral - ization diorite porphyry , and late - mineralization diorite por - phyry at Boyongan , DIO series at Bayugo ) .
In other cases ( e . g . , Tampakan : Rohrlach , 2002 ) relict porphyry - style quartz veins occur in pervasively quartz - alunite - clayâ altered rock , providing evidence for overprinting of earlier K silicate assemblages .
Many Philippine districts display a spatial relationship between porphyry systems and illite - and / or alunite - altered lithocaps ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Chang et al . , 2011 ) .
Many Philippine districts display a spatial relationship between porphyry systems illite - and alunite - altered lithocaps ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Chang et al . , 2011 ) .
These results are consistent with numerical models describing the convective cooling rates of porphyry stocks of comparable size and emplacement depth ( e . g . , Norton , 1982 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , which demonstrate cooling to < 200 Â°C over intervals of less than 100 , 000 years .
This raises intriguing questions as to their potential relationships to Boyongan and / or Bayugo .
The documented paragenetic relationships demonstrate multiple discrete cycles of K silicate - stage veining and alteration associated with each synmineralization intrusive event .
Located in the northeast of the island of Mindanao , Boyongan and Bayugo are two Cu - Au porphyry mineral deposits discovered by Anglo American in 2000 and 2003 , respectively , beneath postmineralization cover in the historic Surigao Au district of the southern Philippines ( Fig . 1 ) .
Superior grade development in high - grade zones at Boyongan , locally exceeding 2 % Cu and 3 g / t Au , developed where fertile vein stages from two or more magmatic - hydrothermal cycles affected the same wall rock .
Despite the inherent uncertainty of provenance , the proximity of these boulder fields to the Boyongan and Bayugo deposits and the similarity of veining and related K silicate alteration styles to those observed in situ suggest that these boulders were derived from Boyongan and / or Bayugo as they were exposed by exhumation and ero - sion .

Despite the simplicity of this sequence , detailed paragenetic reconstructions reveal that this characteristic progression of veining and K silicate alteration was repeated with the emplacement of each synmineralization intrusive event , revealing multiple magmatic - hydrothermal cycles of alteration and mineralization .
On the basis of these close spa - tial and temporal relationships , these authors interpreted a genetic link between the two alteration styles , suggesting that porphyry and quartz - alunite - clay alteration styles rep - resented distinct products of a single hydrothermal system .

Porphyry copper deposits account for more than 80 % of the worldâs total Cu resources .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulï¬des in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations .
Sulï¬de remains undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized sulfur - enriched magmas where sulfate is the dominant sulfur species , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .

Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH suï¬ciently and the fO2 reaches the hematiteâmagnetite oxygen fugacity buï¬er , which in turn increases the pH for a given fO2 .

Porphyry Cuâ ( Au ) â ( Mo ) deposits are one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Sillitoe , 1997 , 2010 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Cooke 1 .
Porphyry Cu - ( Au ) - ( Mo ) deposits are one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Sillitoe , 1997 ( Sillitoe , , 2010Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , hosting most of the world ' s copper resources ( Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Halter et al . , 2002 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are usually closely associated with a specific type of convergent - margin magma , namely adakite ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Mungall , 2002 ) , although the association and genetic connections are contentious ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012bRichards , 2012 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are usually closely related to magmas high oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , more than two orders of magnitude higher than the fayalite - magnetite - quartz oxygen buffer ( DFMQ + 2 ) ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
ferrous iron oxidation ) inducing sulfate reduction and corresponding oxygen fugacity fluctuations ( Sun et al . , 2004 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ) .
Sulfate is the dominant sulfur species in porphyries associated with large copper deposits ( Imai , 2000 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Valencia et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth and silicate magmas include C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
The optimal initial oxygen fugacity for porphyry copper deposits should be lower than the magnetite - hematite buffer , otherwise there is no ferrous iron in the system .
Copper porphyry deposits are also usually associated with calc - alkalic shallow intrusive rocks ( Mungall , 2002 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Low oxygen fugacity is a favorable condition for copper porphyry mineralization .
The high percentage of S 3 Ã ( > 50 % to 95 % of the dissolved sulfur ) and high solubility ( up to 1 % ) of sulfur near the hematite - magnetite redox buffer , coupled with its lower concentration and percentage at oxygen fugacity between nickel - nickel oxide and FMQ buffers with near - neutral pH ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , provide a chemical gradient between the reaction front with high oxygen fugacity close to the hematite - magnetite redox buffer and alteration zones with lower oxygen fugacities farther away .
H + may mobilize potassium from silicate minerals , and trigger potassium alteration .
Adakite and porphyry copper deposits
Adakite deposits
Adakite and porphyry copper deposits
Adakite was initially proposed to result from partial melting of subducted young oceanic crust ( Kay , 1978 ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) .
Adakite is generally defined on the basis of geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 P 56 wt % , Al 2 O 3 P 15 wt % , Y 6 18 ppm , Yb 6 1 . 9 ppm and Sr P 400 ppm ) ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) without detailed petrologic constraints .
Crystallization of garnet results in higher La / Yb , Sr / Y ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Rodriguez et al . , 2007 ) similar to adakites , but this process should also lead to higher and varied Gd / Yb , which is not seen in adakites of a single magma series ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Plagioclase is a common mineral in arc magmas ( e . g . , Bachmann et al . , 2005 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) , the crystallization of which should considerably decrease Sr concentrations in magmas and erase the adakitic signatures ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits , however , are usually associated with intermediate rocks ( Richards , 2011a ) , which are not highly evolved magmas .
Copper is moderately incompatible in most rock - forming minerals , but is compatible in amphibole , such that hornblende crystallization has detrimental effects on Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2012b ) .
The subduction of older and wetter oceanic crust in the west Pacific presumably corresponds to magmas more hydrous than those associated with younger and drier oceanic crusts in the east .
Modern porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in shallow intrusive rocks .
Lower pressures are essential for fluids to exsolve from magmas during magma evolution ( Sun et al . , 2007a ) .
Most convergent margin magmas , either adakite or normal arc rocks , indicate high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 5 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Arculus , 1994 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , no matter whether the high oxygen fugacity was primary , resulting from subduction released fluids ( Sun et al . , 2007b ) or secondary , due to higher degrees of magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
High oxygen fugacity aside , slab melts have much higher initial copper concentrations than normal arc rocks ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , because of the much higher Cu abundances in MORB ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than in the continental crust ( Rudnick and Foun - tain , 1995 ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) and the mantle ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) .
Simple magmatic processes cannot raise its concentration by more than 100 times to form Cu porphyry deposits .
Slab melts have considerably higher initial Cu , S contents and also high oxygen fugacities , a combination promoting Cu porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
Slab melts have considerably higher initial Cu contents and also high oxygen fugacities , a combination promoting Cu porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .

Ore - forming conditions and the stability of the trisulfur S 3 Ã ion
Oxygen fugacities of major tectonic settings ( Bryant et al . , 2007 ) .
Pressure has much less effect on the stability of trisulfur S 3 Ã ion as illustrated by the available data .
The bulk metal budget of porphyry copper deposits is primarily controlled by the composition of the incoming fluid from an underlying magma chamber ( Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) , therefore , the oscillation of hematite and magnetite crystallizations is probably also common at depths , controlling the supply of metals , sulfur and potassium .
High oxygen fugacity may eliminate sulï¬de in the source region and keep the melt sulï¬de undersaturated , thereby promoting porphyry copper mineralization .
Adakitic rocks have higher initial contents of copper , sulfur and iron than normal arc rocks , which are essential for porphyry Cu mineralization .

, sulfate , and sulfide in an aqueous solution , as a function of oxygen fugacity ( log 10 fO 2 , in bars ) and acidity ( pH = Ãlog 10 m H + , in moles per kilogram ) at 350 Â°C and 0 . 5 GPa illustrating sulfate reduction ( modified after ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) ) .
The final mineralization of porphyry copper has been attributed to magnetite crystallization ( i . e .
In oxidized porphyry magmas , oxidized states , i . e . , sulfate , CO 2 and H 2 O , are the dominant species , leaving ferrous iron the only reducing agent .
The potassic alteration zones may be taken as " relay stations " in the building blocks of porphyry copper deposits .
The solubility of sulfur increases dramatically with increasing oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
The major mineralization likely occurs at temperatures between 400 and 300 Â°C ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Valencia et al . , 2008 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Richards , 2011b ) .
The oxygen fugacities of convergent margin magmas are systematically higher than those of intraplate settings .
The oxidation of ferrous iron dur - ing the crystallization of magnetite and hematite is the causal process of sulfate reduction and consequent mineralization .
The oxidation of ferrous iron dur - ing the crystallization magnetite and hematite is the causal process of sulfate reduction and consequent mineralization .
The hematiteâmagnetite intergrowth marks the upper limits of fO2 favorable for the mineralization , and thus may be a powerful tool for future prospecting of large porphyry cop - per deposits .
This chemical gradient , in turn , drives S 3 Ã to the potassic alteration zone , where it further reduces to HS Ã and promotes the final mineralization .
The higher sulfur concentration in oceanic crust ( source rocks ) , together with the high oxygen fugacity of adakite at convergent margins , results in considerably higher sulfate and total sulfur concentrations in slab melts than normal arc rocks at the same oxygen fugacity .
The trisulfur S 3 Ã ion has been demonstrated to be the dominant sulfur species at temperatures between 250 - 450 Â°C and 0 . 5 - 3 . 5 GPa , and is more stable at higher temperature ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , i . e . , it is Fig . 5 .
Most adakites cannot be readily explained by fractionation of normal arc magmas ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Most adakites are andesitic , and amphibole crystallization cannot increase the Sr / Y ratio quickly enough .
Some adakitic rocks occur in locations far away from subduction zones or where subduction and collision finished long before magmatism ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Chung et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2005Wang et al . , , 2007aHuang et al . , 2008 ) ; these have been attributed to partial melting of either thickened ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) or foundered lower continental crust ( Gao et al . , 2004 ) , or newly underplated mafic crust ( Petford and Atherton , 1996 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) .

( 3 ) Oxidation of calc - alkalic adakitic rocks with major components from slab melting is one of the best can - didates for formation of giant porphyry copper deposits .
( 1 ) The ï¬nal mineralization process of porphyry copper deposits is controlled by the reduction of sulfate at the expense of ferrous iron oxidation .
Note , ferrous iron is more stable in hydrous solution at lower pH values , such that low pH resulting from sulfate reduction ( Eq .
At the high pressures at which most TTGs were emplaced , fluids remain dissolved in magmas .
Neither hypogene plutons , nor eruptive volcanic rocks , can form porphyry deposits .
3 Ã Ã¾ 20H 2 O Ã¾ 15Fe 2Ã¾ Â¼ 6HS Ã Ã¾ 5Fe 3 O 4 Ã¾ 34H Ã¾Ã°4Ã Magnetite formed during this process usually coexists with sulfide .
The ï¬nal porphyry copper mineralization is controlled by sulfate reduction , which starts with magnetite crystallization , accompanied by decreasing pH and correspondingly increasing fO2 .
To form a porphyry copper deposit with 0 . 5 wt % of copper in the form of chalcopyrite , the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron results in about 0 . 36 wt % of H + in Fig . 1 .
The final mineralization requires further reduction of S 3 Ã to S 2 2Ã , HS Ã , etc , which also needs the oxidation of ferrous iron to magnetite , further lowering pH values ( e . g . , Eq .
Although ore - forming porphyry magmas formed at high temperature , the final mineralization occurs during the cooling of hydrous magma chambers from > 700 Â°C down to < 250 Â°C ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Additional sulfur is presented in the form of sulfate at high oxygen fugacity .
( 2 ) The hematiteâmagnetite oscillation implies intensive sulfate reduction , which is favorable for giant por - phyry copper deposits .
Given that Cu is a chalcophile element , its final mineralization should , however , be mainly controlled by the behavior of reduced sulfur , S 2Ã ( Sun et al . , 2004 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ) , which inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S 6 + : HSO 4 Ã / SO 4 2Ã ) in the oxidized source magma to sulfides ( S 2Ã : H 2 S / HS - / S 2Ã ) or polysulfides ( e . g . , S 2 2Ã , S 3 Ã ) during deposition .
Given that Cu mineralization should , however , be mainly controlled by the behavior of reduced sulfur , S 2Ã ( Sun et al . , 2004 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ) , which inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S 6 + : HSO 4 Ã / SO 4 2Ã ) in the oxidized source magma to sulfides ( S 2Ã : H 2 S / HS - / S 2Ã ) or polysulfides ( e . g . , S 2 2Ã , S 3 Ã ) during deposition .
( 1 ) , the sulfate reduction and ferrous iron oxidation lead to a decrease of pH in ore - forming fluids within the porphyry system .
Moreover , Cu is compatible in amphibole , such that amphibole fractional crystallization has a negative effect on Cu mineralization .
In summary , Cu is a moderately incompatible element with abundances of $30 ppm in the primitive mantle ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , $26 ppm in the continental crust ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , and roughly the same value for the asthenospheric mantle .
Most of the porphyries , with the exception of several giant deposits , are small with surface exposure of less than 1 km 2 , which is not big enough to supply all the metals locally .
Therefore , the highest initial oxygen fugacity of the magmas favorable for porphyry copper deposits should be lower than the hematiteâmagnetite buï¬er , as this pro - vides ferrous iron in the system .
However , the formation mecha - nism and controlling factors of porphyry copper deposits remain obscure .
However , the formation mecha - nism porphyry copper deposits remain obscure .
However , the formation mecha - nism and controlling factors porphyry copper deposits remain obscure .
In fact , the pH value is usually close to or even higher than neutral values during potassic alteration at the main stage of porphyry copper mineralization .
In contrast , metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require low oxygen fugacity for stabilization .
In addition , oceanic crust has sulfur abundances over 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , which is about 4 times that of mantle peridotite values ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and more than 2 times the continental crust abundance ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Nearly all the ore - forming porphyries have abundant sulfate ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
Therefore , the pH value must have been buffered during the mineralization , and thus simple magnetite crystallization alone cannot plausibly drive the formation of porphyry copper deposits .
Here we report magnetite - hematite intergrowths from several large porphyry copper deposits .
Therefore , the pH value during potassic alteration should be buffered by this reaction to near neutral , near the intersection of the sulfate reduction line and hematite - magnetite buffer ( Fig . 2 ) .
This kind of " adakite " which can be distinguished from slab melts using isotopic and chemical compositions ( Liu et al . , 2010b ; Ling et al . , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) , usually is not associated with Cu porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Therefore , the P - T conditions of Fig . 2 are appropriate for illustration .
In most cases , magnetite crystallizes earlier than hematite , which releases H + and consequently increases the oxygen fugacity of sulfate reduction in the system ( Fig . 2 , Eq .
Therefore , both intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites .
Therefore , both intrusive and eruptive rocks can be classified as adakites .
The fact is that porphyry copper deposits are selectively associated with adakitic rocks .
In case there is residual sulfide , the sulfide concentration in melts is independent of oxygen fugacity , and usually undersaturated during ascent ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases because it is controlled by the sulfide - sulfate reaction ( Fig . 2 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) .
In addition to the slab melting model ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Yogodzinski and Kelemen , 1998 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Moyen , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010b ) , several other mechanisms are proposed for the formation of adakite or adakitic rocks , including ( 1 ) partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) , ( 2 ) partial meltings of underplated new crust ( Petford and Atherton , 1996 ) , and ( 3 ) fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
In addition , the iron content of MORB is higher than mantle peridotite , such that slab melt tends to have higher iron contents than mantle derived - magmas .
In addition , the iron content higher than mantle peridotite , such that slab melt tends to have higher iron contents than mantle derived - magmas .
Therefore , neither fractional crystallization nor partial melting of the continental crust can explain the close association between adakite and Cu deposits .
The distribution of copper porphyry deposits along the Pacific subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) does not support the model of fractional crystallization of hydrous magmas .
The near absence of porphyry Cu deposits in Archean TTG has been used to argue against the genetic links between adakite and porphyry Cu deposits ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
It is suggested that trisulfur S 3 Ã ion is stable and plays a major role at pressures between 0 . 05 and 0 . 5 GPa ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) .
This is supported by hematite in drillhole samples from diorite in depths in the Zijinshan porphyry copper deposit .
More than 90 % of the porphyry Cu deposits in the world are distributed along convergent margins ( Fig . 1 ) .
The field between the hematite - magnetite buffer and SO 4 2Ã - HS Ã - S 3 Ã reaction lines ( Fig . 2 ) marks the optimal ranges of pH and oxygen fugacity conditions .
Experiments show that partial melting of MORB with 6 . 6 % MgO produces melts with Mg number lower than 50 ( Rapp et al . , 1999 ) , i . e . , adakites can not be slab melts according to the Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) criteria .
Therefore , the initial pH and fO2 ranges of porphyries favorable for porphyry copper mineralization are deï¬ned by the hema - 2 âHS âS3 reaction lines .
Note that the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much smaller than that of ( Bryant et al . , 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from Japan and other arc settings .
Notwithstanding the lack of low pressure data for the trisulfur S 3 Ã ion , the P - T conditions chosen in this study are reasonable .
More than 90 % of the world porphyry copper deposits are located along convergent margins .
1 ) hinders the formation of magnetite and HS Ã , which is therefore unfavorable for copper porphyry mineralization .
This is consistent with the high sulfur contents of several thousand ppm in ore forming porphyries ( Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
The orange field between the hematite - magnetite buffer and SO 4 2Ã - HS Ã - S 3 Ã reaction lines mark the optimal initial oxygen fugacity and acidity of magmas favorable for porphyry copper mineralization .
The orange field between the hematite - magnetite buffer and SO 4 2Ã - HS Ã - S 3 Ã reaction lines mark the optimal initial oxygen fugacity and acidity of magmas favorable for porphyry copper mineralization .
One may argue that most of the porphyries originated at high temperature ( i . e . , > 700 Â°C ) and were then intruded to shallow depths ( at pressures lower than 0 . 5 GPa ) , conditions which are different from the P - T conditions of Fig . 2 .
Studies show that in addition to magmas at shallow depths ( at paleodepths < 5 km ) , porphyry systems are usually related to underlying composite plutons at paleodepths of 5 - 15 km ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , which supply magmas , fluids and other ore - forming materials for the deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
This contribution focuses on the chemical reactions that control the mineralization process , and aims to decipher the factors controlling the formation of porphyry copper deposits .
Previous studies have revealed that porphyry cop - per deposits are usually associated with oxidized , calc - alkalic , adakitic shallow intrusive rocks .

Previous studies have revealed that porphyry cop - per deposits are usually associated with oxidized , calc - alkalic , adakitic shallow intrusive rocks .
This can be plausibly related to the high pH value of calc - alkalic magmas , which corresponds to a lower oxygen fugacity for the sulfide - sulfate transition line as shown in the pH versus log fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 2 ) .
Therefore , our model is also valid at high temperature .
This explains the general coincidence of potassic alteration with the ore body .
This definition excludes more than 90 % of adakites , as defined using the classic criteria such as high Sr and low Y ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Its presence has been cited as the cause of the extraction of additional chalcophile elements from the source region due to the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting and the higher solubility of sulfate in silicate liquid ( Sun et al . , 2004 ( Sun et al . , , 2011Mungall et al . , 2006 ) .
This is probably responsible for triggering sericite alteration at lower pH values .
More importantly , there is no evidence for pure amphibole crystallization during adakite magma evolution .
Nevertheless , there is essentially no known porphyry copper deposit in Japan .
This is supported by the common occurrence of magnetite in porphyry copper deposits ( Vila and Sillitoe , 1991 ; Mao et al . , 2006 ; Imai et al . , 2007b ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ) ( Eq .
An increasing number of studies show that most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with " true " adakites ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Morozumi , 2003 ; Reich et al . , 2003 ; Rae et al . , 2004 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ; Qu et al . , 2004b ; Borisova et al . , 2006 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Hou et al . , 2009 ; Ling et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) also argued that " porphyry Cu deposits are the evolved products of extensive crustal - level processing of calc - alkaline basalt - andesite - dacite - rhyolite series magmas " .
1 ) , which is roughly equivalent to concentrated HCl , assuming 3 % of water in the porphyry and assuming there are no pH buffers in the system .
It became a hot topic because of similarities to the Archaean tonalite - trodhjemite - granite ( TTG ) series ( Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ) , the importance of such melts to the formation of the continental crust ( McDonough , 1991 ; Rapp et al . , 2003 ; Xiao et al . , 2006 ; Ding et al . , 2009 ; Xiong et al . , 2009Xiong et al . , , 2011 , and their close association with large porphyry Cu deposits ( Thieblemont et al . , 1997 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012a .
These provide a plausible explanation for the formation of copper porphyry deposits .
For this reason , Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) attributed the adakitic signature to amphibole fractional crystallization .
However , we note that Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) claimed that adakite - like intrusive rocks are rarely associated with porphyry Cu deposits .
This distinction is based on a much more restrictive criteria for adakite that Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) proposed themselves .
Therefore , there must be additional factors that control the association between adakites and porphyry copper deposits .
Several other criteria also act in opposite directions , which " artificially " makes adakites rare under this definition ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .

The Jinshajiang - Red River Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo belt , extending over 2000 km in the eastern Indian - Eurasian collision zone , is an important magmatic belt formed in an intra - continental strike - slip system in SW China .
The magmas appear to have been derived from the asthenospheric mantle , possibly with mixing of material from the buried Tethyan oceanic lithosphere , upper mantle , and / or crust ( Tran et al . , 2013 ( Tran et al . , , 2014 .
Most porphyry Mo deposits occurred in post - collisional settings along the Urals , Tianshan to Xilamulun sutures .

These deposits formed in magmatic arcs within the extensive subduction - accretion complex of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB ; or Altaids ) and Transbaikal - Mongolian Orogens , from the late Neoproterozoic , through the Paleozoic to the Jurassic .
These arcs were predominantly located on the Paleo - Tethys Ocean margin of the proto - Asian continent , but are also associated with the closure of two back - arc basins behind the ocean - facing margin .
These arcs were predominantly located on the Paleo - Tethys Ocean margin proto - Asian continent , but are also associated with the closure of two back - arc basins behind the ocean - facing margin .
These magmas are typically calc - alkaline to high - K calc - alkaline ( Heinrich and Neubaner , 2002 ) .
These geochemical signatures suggest that subduction played a dominant role in their petrogenesis and that residual garnet was left in the magma sources .
These porphyry - epithermal Cu - Au systems are associated with Cretaceous diorite porphyry , quartz porphyry and granodiorite porphyry , and hosted by Cretaceous porphyries and their associated volcanic rocks , as well as Jurassic clastic rocks of littoral facies .

There are two types of porphyry copper systems : ( 1 ) porphyryskarn Cu with ages of 175 - 135 Ma , distributed along the Qin - Hang belt , Middle - Lower Yangtze River Valley , Northeast Taihang - Southeast Great Hinggan Range from south to north ; and ( 2 ) porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au with ages of ca .
The formation of these deposits is related to the change in convergence between Africa and Eurasia from east - west to north - south in the Late Cretaceous ( about 110 Ma ) , resulting in subduction - related magmatism and related porphyry copper deposits , including Majdanpek , Veliki Krively , Chelopech and Bor ( Lips , 2002 ; Fig . 1 ) .

In addition to the general tectonic , geologic and metallogenic setting , and the distribution of the mineralized systems listed above , descriptions of individual deposits provide important insights into their metallogenic significance ( Seltmann and Porter , 2005 ; Seltmann et al . , 2013Seltmann et al . , , 2014Xiao et al . , 2008 ; Li , 2006 ; Pirajno et al . , 2009 ; Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .
The recurrent feature of these ore systems and related felsic rocks is their derivation from partial melting of stagnant or residual oceanic slabs , and mixing with a variable amount of crustal material during magma ascent to shallower levels .

It is proposed that this giant igneous event was related to coeval lithospheric delamination in eastern China .
The intrusions associated with Cu mineralization in both the Late Triassic subduction - related setting and the Late Cretaceous post - subduction setting share a similar magma composition in the Zhongdian magmatic arc .
In particular , the key role of postsubduction - related porphyry ore systems is emphasized , comprising collisional and post - collisional Cu - Mo porphyry deposits during the geological history of the Eurasian continent .

These age data confirm that the porphyry Mo deposits become younger from west to east , which also fits well with the tectonic evolution suggested by Xiao et al . ( 2008 ) .
These deposits are also typical porphyry Cu - Au systems , genetically associated with quartz diorite , monzodiorite , and quartz monzonite .
The only difference is that the magma formed in the post - subduction setting contains more crustal components .
100 Ma , which are located in the Cretaceous basins of Shanghang in western Fujian province ( Southeast China ) , Yangchun in western Guangdong province ( South China ) , and Xiaoxinancha in Jilin province ( Northeast China ) .
Apart from the subduction - related porphyry Cu - Mo deposits there are several Early - Middle Jurassic large - scale porphyry Mo deposits , such as the 177 - Ma old Luming and Daheishan deposits in Northeast China ( Tan et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) , which are located in the back - arc basin south of the active continental margin .

Ling et al . ( 2009 ) suggested that the flat subduction of an oceanic ridge is responsible for the formation of the porphyry - skarn Cu - Au - Mo deposits in the Middle - Lower Yangtze River Valley in Early Cretaceous .
Indeed , our knowledge and understanding of genetic models for porphyry systems is largely from the research focus on the Circum - Paciï¬c continental and oceanic margins .
In Pakistan , Reko Diq shows two age groups , early Miocene and mid - late Miocene , whereas Saindak is of late Miocene age ( Richards et al . , 2012 ) .
From northeastern to southwestern China , this metallogenic province is bounded by the Daxing ' an , Taihang , and Xuefeng mountains in the west ( Fig . 3 ) .
Alternatively , Gao et al . ( 2013 ) linked the porphyry Cu - Mo deposits with the destruction of the North China Craton ( NCC ) keel during Late Mesozoic and inferred that the ore - bearing porphyries and associated volcanic rocks have a common parental basaltic magma , derived from partial melting of metasomatized mantle lithosphere beneath the NCC .

The latter is considered to be part of the vast Circum - Pacific ore belt .
It is widely accepted that the initial time of the India - Eurasia continental collision is between 65 and 50 Ma ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Ding et al . , 2005 ; Searle et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) , with the main collision occurring between 55 and 50 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) .
Subsequent to subduction , remelting of the residual oceanic slab most likely further metasomatized the arc lithosphere , as described by Richards ( 2009 ) .
The ore systems are similar to those in East Qinling , with porphyry Mo in the center and peripheral hydrothermal Pb - Zn deposits ( Mao et al . , 2009 ( Mao et al . , , 2011b .
Since the Mongolia - Okhotsk Ocean closed from west to east the age of the mineralization is correspondingly younger from Early Triassic to Middle Jurassic .
In western Pakistan , subduction of the Arabian Sea beneath the Makran accretionary complex resulted in ore formation along the Chagai volcanic arc belt ( Richards et al . , 2012 ) .
The study carried out by Qu et al . ( 2007 ) indicates that the porphyry intrusions responsible for the Cu - Mo deposits in the Gangdese belt are K - enriched and belong to the shoshonitic to high - K calc - alkaline series , characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) Rb , K , U , Th , Sr , Pb and depletion of high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta , Ti and heavy rare earth elements ( HREE ) and Y without Eu anomalies .

Some of the main features of the spatial - temporal distribution of Cu and Mo porphyry systems and related geodynamic processes of the three metallogenic belts are described .
At the same time , the Paleo - Pacific Ocean began subducting beneath the Siberian craton to form the Sayan - Transbaikal arc , which by the Permian expanded to become the Selanga - Gobi - Khanka arc , and for a period was continuous with the Kazakh - Mongol arc .
The three stages of the geodynamic evolution and associated ore - systems in the Gangdese ore belt mentioned above are illustrated in the cartoon of Fig . 5 .
Peng et al . ( 2013Peng et al . ( , 2014 suggest that during the subduction of the Garze - Litang oceanic slab , partial melting of the subducted slab or of the mantle wedge above the slab caused the formation of abundant Triassic porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits in the Zhongdian arc .

However , Qiu et al . ( 2004 ) proposed that the Bangonghu - Nujiang Ocean opened in the Early Jurassic , then subducted towards north in Middle Jurassic and closed in Early Cretaceous .
Particularly , Seltmann et al . ( 2013Seltmann et al . ( , 2014 gives a detailed summary of the Cu ( Mo , Au ) porphyry systems in the CAOB and their corresponding tectonic evolution .
So far , exploration is concentrated on the Duobuza , Bolong , Nadun , Dibaonamugang , Rongna , Narou and Tiegelong porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au - Cu deposits .

At about 45 - 30 Ma , tectonism subsequent to the Indian and Eurasian collision resulted in east - west extension in southeastern Tibet , and caused emplacement of mantle - derived potassic magmas along the Ailao Shan - Red River shear zone ( Chung et al , 1997 ( Chung et al , , 2005 .
Intensive exploration particularly in the last decade in SE Europe , Turkey , China and Myanmar , has revealed a total resource of more than 100 Mt Cu , from about 50 porphyry copper deposits and numerous related prospects ( Mutschler et al . , 1999 ; Singer et al . , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) .

High Ca alunite , including huangite , also occurs at locations proximal to the intrusive center .
Alunite mineral composition analyzed by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spec - trometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) indicates that the Pb content decreases toward the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , Sr / Pb , and La / Pb increase markedly .
Whole - rock compositions , using only nonmineralized ( taken as Cu < 0 . 1wt % and Au < 0 . 1 ppm ) and alunite - bearing samples , show that Pb and Ag / Au , plus Hg and Ag , decrease toward the intrusive center , and Sr / Pb and La / Pb ratios increase .
Lithocaps can have large areal extent ( > 20 km 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) and , because they resist erosion , are typically prominent at the surface , which generally makes them easy to find .
Magmatic gases such as HCl and SO2 fractionate to the vapor and , after condensing into ground water , form an acidic liquid .
Mineralization , if present , forms in a subsequent stage ( White , 1991 ) , as seen at Lepanto ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) and other 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1383 1384 CHANG ET AL .
Lithocaps elsewhere show many similar characteristics that in general indicate the potential for high sulfidation mineraliza - tion , but most are not strongly mineralized .
Silicic zones at Lep - anto , vuggy or massive in texture , largely occur in proximal lo - cations close to the feeder structure ( s ) and tend to be absent in distal locations , similar to other lithocap horizons ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
SWIR spectral features of alunite and some trace elements in alunite show indications of sys - tematic variations relative to the Far Southeast porphyry source .
Lithocap samples of quartz - alunite , even only a few hundreds of meters away from the Lepanto orebodies , con - tain < 50 ppb Au .
Gold is not appreciably introduced during the early vapor condensate - related leaching and lithocap de - velopment , consistent with the extremely low Au content of near - surface , low - pressure magmatic vapors ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994 ; Hedenquist , 1995 ) , in contrast to the higher metal contents in high - pressure volcanic vapor ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) , and in vapor - rich inclusions from high - pressure porphyry depths ( Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Geophysical signatures In the Mankayan district airborne magnetic imagery is complex and difficult to interpret , reflecting the combined ef - fects of low magnetic inclination , magnetic topography and remnant magnetization in an area with complex and variable volcanic stratigraphy and many intrusions .
Radiometric data reflect bedrock units , but show no effects of mineralization .
Alteration mapping , aided by SWIR equipment , is essential to assess the advanced argillic lithocap environment , as is mapping of lithology and structures .
Stacked lithocap horizons may occur , and in such cases the lower layers have a better chance of being mineralized ( e . g . , Quimsacocha ) .
Low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap , particularly at the end of an elongate lithocap , deserve special attention , as the anomaly may be caused by demagnetization due to porphyry - style alteration , e . g . , either phyllic or advanced argillic overprint of potassic alteration .

White mica - pyrite alteration , coupled with various elements of the epithermal suiteâboth As and Se at Mankayanâmay indicate the presence of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins , especially in a district with known porphyry or high - sufidation mineralization or large lithocaps .
An airborne geo - physics survey indicates that the Far Southeast orebody is associated with a wide zone of demagnetization due to extensive magnetite - destructive phyllic alteration .
The unconformity has a cone shape with two vent - related depressions ( Fig . 2 ) .
The Mankayan mineral district of northern Luzon , Philippines , hosts several significant ore deposits and prospects of various types within an area of ~ 25 km2 , including the Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit , the Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposit , the Victoria intermediate sulfidation epithermal Au - Ag vein deposit , the Teresa epithermal Au - Ag vein deposit , the Guinaoang porphyry Cu - Au deposit , and the Buaki and Palidan porphyry Cu - Au prospects , all having formed in a period of about 2 m . y . , from ~ 3 Ma .
The geo - logic units include ( 1 ) a basement composed of Late Cretaceous to middle Miocene metavolcanic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks ; ( 2 ) the Miocene 12 to 13 Ma tonalitic Bagon intrusive complex ; ( 3 ) the Pliocene , ~ 2 . 2 to 1 . 8 Ma , Imbanguila dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks ; and ( 4 ) postmineralization cover rocks , including the ~ 1 . 2 to 1 . 0 Ma Bato dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks and the ~ 0 . 02 Ma Lapangan tuff .
The alteration and its subhorizontal geometry indi - cate that it is a lithocap or coalesced lithocaps .
The Mankayan mineral district , northern Luzon , Philippines , was studied in order to develop tools for exploration in such districts , as it is the site of several large intrusion - related ore deposits and prospects .
The Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal deposit and associated lithocap host is located above and adjacent to the Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal deposit and associated lithocap host is located above and adjacent Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Fig . 1 ) .
The hypersaline liquid causes the deep potassic alteration , whereas the vapor , being buoyant , ascends toward the surface along structures .
The unconformity between the basement and Imbanguila units channeled the flow of this condensate , facil - itated by the Lepanto fault , and the leaching and alteration along the path produced the Lepanto lithocap ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
The lithocap extends prominently to the northwest from the Far Southeast porphyry , rather than in all the direc - tions , due in part to the nature of the unconformity and the local geology .
Any condensate ascending along the unconformity to the southeast would lose its permeable channel at this eleva - tion , as hot fluids tend not to move downward .
All lithocaps have structural roots , or feeders , along which the acidic condensate ascends .
The alunite absorption peak at ~ 1 , 480 nm of the SWIR spectrum shifts to higher wavelength positions closer to the Far Southeast porphyry ( Fig . 9a ) .
The Pb content in alunite is lower closer to the intrusive center ( Fig . 10a ) , whereas Sr , Sr / Pb , La , and La / Pb increase ( Apps .
The airborne geo - physical data have not provided any signatures that can be confidently related directly to ore bodies .
The Guinaoang porphyry deposit and the Lepanto high sul - fidation deposit have no apparent geophysical expression .
The Victoria and Theresa vein systems can be tentatively re - lated to a zone of probable demagnetization , consistent with the white mica - pyrite alteration .
The gold anomaly in the quartz - alunite alteration of a litho - cap can be quite low ( < 50 ppb ) , even within a few hundred meters of the surface projection of underground ores .
Such low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap elsewhere may deserve attention .
Since alunite with higher K forms in distal positions at lower tem - perature compared to alunite with higher Na , Pb also has a higher concentration in distal alunite .
Lead in alunite is higher in distal positions ( Fig . 10a ) , prob - ably because Pb substitutes for K , as the ionic radius of Pb2 + ( 1 . 32 ) is closer in size to K + ( 1 . 33 ) than to Na + ( 0 . 98 ) .
When all whole - rock samples were plotted without discrimination , patterns were not found for any other elements of the 57 elements ( Apps .
However , alteration by itself may be insufficient to point to the causative intrusive source .
Within the lithocap that extends ~ 4 km northwest from the intrusion , mineralized roots occur up to ~ 2 . 5 km from the intrusive source , whereas most of the min - eralized horizons are within ~ 1 . 5 km of the intrusion ( Fig . 1 ) .
Normalizing whole - rock Pb to the ( Na + K ) molal content produces a proxy for the alunite mineral composition , and this ratio provides the same indications as the LA - ICP - MS analyses of alunite .
Zonation in mineralogy and texture At Mankayan , the alteration halo to structural feeders of the Lepanto lithocap and ore deposit are zoned ( Fig . 4 ) , sim - ilar to the classic zonation pattern at the structurally con - trolled Summitville high sulfidation epithermal deposit ( Steven and Ratte , 1960 ) ; the alteration zonation , from struc - ture to margin , commonly has a scale of 10s of meters .
Normalizing whole - rock Pb to the ( Na + K ) moles is a proxy for the alunite mineral composition , and as demonstrated in the Mankayan district , the ratio provides the same indication as alunite composi - tions .
Formation of high sulfidation epithermal deposits : a two - stage process Hypogene advanced argillic alteration forms during the ini - tial stage of porphyry development , during vapor discharge .
This lack of Au in the early , near - surface ( i . e . , low - pressure ) vapors explains the < 50 ppb Au anomaly in whole rock within the Lepanto lithocap .
The concealed Victoria epithermal veins consist of intermediate sulfida - tion mineralization on the southwest flank of the porphyry .
They can host high sulfidation epithermal mineralization , particularly within their fracture - controlled roots .
Signatures in alunite Alunite is commonly one of the most abundant minerals in lithocaps , as at Mankayan .
Signatures in whole - rock composition of lithocap samples The Lepanto lithocap does not have significant anomalies of Au .
There are also silicic - advanced argillic alteration patches ~ 600 m above the Far Southeast orebody at the present surface ; these are interpreted to be perched alteration .
In addition to crystal lattice effects , the solubility of these trace elements at different temperatures may also have played a role .
Where the deeper porphyry environment is exposed , the mineralized portion of the lithocap may have been eroded ( R . H . Sillitoe , pers .
The presence of a lithocap of large areal extent ( A . Arribas , pers .
The ores of these deposits are largely blind , and this study was conducted in order to identify signatures and directional indicators that would have potential application during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
Their contents in alunite have a trend that in - creases near the intrusive center ( Apps .
As noted for this lithocap , Pb , Hg , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center ( Figs . 10b , 12a ; Apps .
There are several mag - netic anomalies of relative lows present in the Mankayan district ( Fig . 14 ) , but the one above Far Southeast is special in that it is at the end of a ~ 4 km elongated lithocap .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal and / or porphyry mineralization nearby .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal mineralization nearby .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal and / or porphyry mineralization nearby .
The major - ity of ore ( ~ 70 % ) lies in structural roots , principally the Lep - anto fault ( Fig . 4 ) .
For exploration of lithocaps up to tens of square kilo - meters in size , such local alteration zonation is of limited use .
In sum - mary , the geometry of the unconformity and the spatial distribution of the rock units may have caused the asymmetry of the lithocap .

The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized , alunite - bearing whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .
The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .
This is useful , as whole - rock analyses are much less expensive , with a faster turnaround time , than LA - ICP - MS analyses .
Genetic link between porphyry and lithocap : the basic processes The genetic link between porphyry - style alteration - miner - alization and lithocap was implied in Sillitoeâs ( 1995a ) defini - tion of lithocap .
In a district without outcropping veins , exploration for such veins is typically difficult .
If there are multiple permeable layers or perched water tables , it is possible that multiple , stacked horizons of lithocap will form .
There is no systematic mineralogical or textural zoning in the Lepanto lithocap that indicates direc - tion to the intrusive source .
potential than pervasive quartz - alunite or clay alteration , par - ticularly that associated with structures .
Alternatively , the later mineralizing fluid may have been minor or nonexistent ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation of hypersaline liquid and vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
The horizontal part of the lithocap shows a vertical zonation , with quartz - alunite in the middle and dickite Â± kaolinite above and below , also at a scale of 10s of meters .
Most surface samples of the lithocap contain less than 50 ppb Au , despite many being less than a few hundred meters from underground Cu - Au ore .
The more recently discovered Victoria intermediate sulfidation vein deposit ( Cuison et al . , 1998 ; Claveria , 2001 ) , located within 1 km southwest of the Far Southeast porphyry ( Fig . 1 ) , and the adjacent Teresa vein deposit to the south , completes the assemblage of porphyry and related high - and intermediate sulfidation ore deposits in this intrusion - centered setting .
For example , the patches of advanced argillic alteration at the surface directly above Far Southeast are barren ; like - wise , the upper lithocap horizon over the Quimsacocha de - posit , Ecuador , is also largely barren ( IAMGold staff , pers .
It is critical to locate the structural feeders of lithocaps , as high sulfidation mineralizationâif presentâis most likely to be concentrated there .
Filtering out samples without alunite con - strains the samples to be formed under similarly acidic condi - tions , and to have the same mineralogic nature .
The variation in the ~ 1 , 480 feature of alunite is related to its Na / ( Na + K ) composition ( Fig . 9b ) , which is directly cor - related to the temperature of formation ( Stoffregen and Cygan , 1990 ) .
Surface signatures of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins At the present erosional surface above the Victoria inter - mediate sulfidation veins , there are subtle alteration ( illite to interstratified illite / smectite to smectite + pyrite ) and geo - chemical ( As , Se ) expressions .
In a district that contains many low magnetic anomalies , those closest to the margin of a large lithocap may deserve priority in follow - up investigation .
In addition , the pres - ence of silicic alteration is much more indicative of prospect 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1385 1386 CHANG ET AL .
The rock above this section of the unconformity is mostly dacite por - phyry and it has low permeability ( Fig . 1 ) , which would hin - der further fluid ascent and flow to the southeast .
This in - dicates that integrating geophysical findings with geological knowledge may help increase confidence in targeting .
Despite the relative ease of finding lithocaps , it may be difficult to further define the location of mineralization within , under , or adjacent to a large lithocap due to the lack of directional indicators .
To use the vectors , the outcrops of lithocap alter - ation are assumed to be genetically linked .
In the Mankayan district , the patches of advanced argillic alteration above the Far South - east porphyry lie far above the basement - Imbanguila uncon - formity ( Fig . 2 ) along which the majority of the advanced argillic alteration occurs .
In the Mankayan district , only part of the lithocap is min - eralized .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .

In a district such as at Mankayan with known porphyry and / or high sulfidation de - posits , or even a district containing a barren lithocap , alter - ation and geochemical anomalies can nevertheless provide in - dications of the location of vein targets worthwhile to drill test .
There is no direct surface expression of the magnetic alteration in the ~ 1 , 000 - m deep core of the Far Southeast porphyry deposit , but the ore body occurs in a large zone with obvious demagnetization , providing an indirect guide .
If the as - cending , structurally controlled acidic fluid encounters a per - meable horizon , either an unconformity or one or more rock units , the reactive fluid will flow along and cause intense leaching and alteration in that layer , creating a lithocap above and lateral from the causative intrusion ( Sillitoe , 1995a ; Hedenquist and Taran , in prep . ) .

It is speculated that the va - pors and subsequent acid condensates ascended from the northwestern depression , the northwestern side of which is less steep , and therefore the condensates could flow unob - structed to the northwest .
This study found that several characteristics of the Lepanto lithocap change systematically with distance from the causative intrusion : The alunite absorption peak at ~ 1 , 480 nm in the short wavelength infrared ( SWIR ) spectrum shifts to higher wavelengths where the sample is closer to the intrusive center , due to higher Na and lower K content in the alunite ; published experimental studies indicate that high Na / ( Na + K ) is related to higher formation temperature .
LITHOCAPS are horizontal to subhorizontal blankets of residual quartz and advanced argillic alteration of hypogene origin , occurring over intrusions ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

Hedenquist et al . ( 1998 ) demonstrated that the Lepanto high sulfidation mineralization is caused by the phyllic - stage lower salinity fluid , following early alteration that produced potassic alteration at depth and the lithocap alteration closer to the surface .
The district lies within a well - defined , 150 - km - long belt of porphyry Cu deposits in the Central Cordillera of northern Luzon ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Deyell and Hedenquist , 2011 ; Hollings et al . , 2011a , b ; Waters et al . , 2011 ; Wolfe and Cooke , 2011 ) .
The northwest - striking portion is ~ 4 km long and hosts the Lepanto enargite Au ore deposit , also controlled by the Lepanto fault .
Vectors found in this study include the following : ( 1 ) the alunite peak position at ~ 1480 nm on SWIR spectrum shifts toward higher wavelength in samples that are closer to the intrusive source of acidic condensates ; ( 2 ) in alunite the Pb content decreases closer to the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , La / Pb , and Sr / Pb increase ; ( 3 ) the whole - rock compo - sition of alunite - containing , non - mineralized ( < 0 . 1 % Cu and < 100 ppb Au ) lithocap samples can also point to the intrusive source : Hg , Pb , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center .

Thus , the geophysical survey , while not pointing directly to ore , has provided potential tar - gets for investigation in the Mankayan district .
However , this study did find geochemical patterns zoned in the Lepanto lithocap relative to the Far Southeast porphyry , the intrusive source , in selected suites of samples from the Lepanto lithocap , namely nonmineralized ( Cu < 0 . 1 wt % and Au < 100 ppb ) , alunite - bearing samples .
A prospect should not be discarded only based on a low level of gold anomaly in quartz - alunite alteration , particularly if the lithocap is large .
But not all structurally con - trolled zones of hypogene advanced argillic alteration have as - sociated lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999 ) , either because they did not intersect permeable horizons , or such horizons have subse - quently been eroded .
This study examined the surface expressions of the three principal deposits , Lepanto ( mined out ) , Far Southeast ( drilled out ) , and Victoria ( now being mined ) .

These patches are probably con - nected by fractures with the main lithocap below and thus constitute perched horizons .
One reason for this may be due primarily to hydrologic reasons , i . e . , the sub - sequent mineralizing fluid that comes after the early acidic condensate may not be able to ascend to the elevation of the lithocap , especially to the upper horizons of a perched litho - cap .
In addition , veins on the margin may terminate several hundred meters below the paleosurface , below the level of the lithocap .
In addition to the close spatial relationship ( Sillitoe , 1983 ) and an overlap in alteration and ore mineralogy ( Garcia , 1991 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) , the two orebodies have been shown to be contemporaneous and genetically linked ( Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
This genetic link was demonstrated in the Mankayan district through field observation , radiometric dat - ing , fluid inclusion studies , and stable isotope studies ( Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
The veins are not exposed , but their presence at depth is indicated by subtle alteration ( illite or interstratified illite and / or smectite or smectite + pyrite ) and geochemical ( As , Se ) anomalies at the surface .
Such findings should be widely applicable , given the common relationships noted among such deposits ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) and evidence for transitions between them ( e . g . , Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
commun . , 1999 ) is encouraging for exploration at an early stage , as it indicates extensive hydrothermal activity and potential for high sulfidation ore ; in addition , there is potential for deeper porphyry and marginal epithermal vein mineralization .
Selecting non - mineralized samples re - stricts the samples to all having formed in the early leaching and alteration stage , relatively free of overprinting by later mineralizing fluids which may complicate trends .
This is consistent with the spatial distribution of the samples relative to the intrusive heat source , with Na - rich samples closest to the Far Southeast porphyry .
These vectors point to the causative intrusive source that is the potential center to mineralization , including por - phyry and high sulfidation deposits .
Such trends do not point to ore but they help to indi - cate areas with a higher potential for mineralization , because porphyry - style mineralization occurs in and adjacent to the intrusive source , and high sulfidation mineralization also tends to occur proximal to intrusive source ( s ) and related structures .
The condensate be - comes more reactive as it cools and the acids increasingly dis - sociate , and this causes leaching , forming residual quartz cores with halos of advanced argillic alteration ( quartz - alunite Â± dickite - kaolinite ; Ransome , 1907 ; Steven and RattÃ© , 1960 ; White , 1991 ; Rye , 1993 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
At the kilometer scale , there is no systematic mineralogical or textural zonation relative to the intrusive source in the Lep - anto lithocap .
Conse - quently , these patterns indicate the direction to the intrusive 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1384 EXPLORATION TOOLS FOR PORPHYRY & EPITHERMAL DEPOSITS , MANKAYAN Cu - Au DISTRICT 1385 source of volatiles .
It is one of the country ' s richest mining districts , both in terms of proven and potential economic value as well as abundance and diversity of hydrothermal mineralization ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
The sample filtering practice is essential for selecting rocks formed at ap - proximately the same time and under similar conditions , and by fluids dominated by magmatic characteristics .
The directional indicators and mineralization signatures found in this study have the potential to indicate direction to the intrusive center during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
The subtlety of signatures is strongly dependent on the erosion level ; therefore , even if such indications are not pre - sent at some erosional surfaces , e . g . , > 350 m above the upper extent of veinsâsimilar to those in the Mankayan districtâ the potential of the district should not be ignored if there are other indications of mineralization potential , e . g . , mineralized fragments in an exposed diatreme , or within 2 to 3 km of a porphyry deposit or lithocap .
Fluid inclusions hosted in quartz veins of the early and transit ional stages have very similar composit ions , indicat ing that the init ial single - phase intermediate - density ( ID ) ore - forming fluids of these two mineralizing stages were exsolved from similar ly evo lved magma reservo irs in the underlying magma chamber .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits above upper crustal magma chambers represent focused zones o f magma intrusion , heat transfer , fluid flow , hydrothermal alteration , and mineral precipitat ion of great economic significance ( Dilles et al . , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

Processes in the magma chamber are decisive for the generat ion o f ore metal - charged magmat ic - hydrothermal fluids ( Halter et al . , 2005 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010 ; AudÃ©tat and Simon , 2012 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Focusing of large vo lumes o f ascending magmat ic derived fluids and efficient physico - chemical mechanisms for metal precipitat ion in quartz vein stockworks with hydrothermal alteration are prime factors determining the metal enrichment ( Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; AudÃ©tat et al . , 2008 ; Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ) .
Basalt ic to andesit ic magmas are inferred to be the main fluid and metal source for porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits .
Porphyry Cu mineralization is generally produced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction o f hypersaline brine and a much larger mass o f low - density vapor either direct ly exsolved from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more likely , generated when a single - phase fluid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .
Magmatic apatite in the porphyry intrusions ( â¥62 wt % SiO2 of who le rock ; 77 - 78 wt % SiO2 of melt inclusions in apat ite ) at Yulong shows a large variat ion in SO3 contents from 0 to 1 . 4 wt % .
Post - entrapment modification of fluid inclusions in quartz veins 5 . 2 . 1 .
Elemental diffusion and representativeness of fluid inclusions Rapid post - entrapment diffusion o f Cu , Ag , Li , and Na in and out of fluid inclusions via cat ion exchange through quartz has been well documented experimentally ( e . g . , Zajacz et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2009 ; Lerchbaumer and AudÃ©tat , 2012 ) .
ID inclusions are also variable in some other components ( e . g . , Mo / K and Cs / K ratios in Fig . 12B , C ) .
Chalcopyrite in A2E veins occurring as microfracture infillings are frequently in contact with the CL - dark quartz .
A3E veins are equivalents of Cu - Fe - sulfides in A2E veins .
Quartz would precipitate rapidly due to the sudden decrease of fluid pressure from lithostate to hydrostate during hydraulic fracturing in porphyry environment ( Fournier , 1999 ; Rusk and Reed , 2002 ) .
Liquid - rich inclusions in DL veins locally coexisting with a much smaller number o f vapor inclusions suggest that the late - stage fluids intersected the solvus as liquids at relat ively low temperature and pressure , and bo iled to form minor low - density vapors ( Driesner and Heinrich , 2007 ) .
Liquid - rich inclusions in DL veins have higher Cs / K and As / K than other fluid inclusion types in the early - and transit ional - stage quartz veins ( Fig . 12 ) , suggesting that the late - stage fluids are more evo lved than the ore - forming fluids .

The similar metal ratios magmatic sulfides , ore - forming fluids , and ores indicate that these sulfides release their metal load to the ore - forming fluids upon bulk disso lution of the sulfides during magma degassing ( Halter et al . , 2002a ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) .

The liquid - rich inclusions in DL veins show consistent microthermometric behavior and thus are unlikely to have suffered from postentrapmental modificat ions .
The DL veins formed from fluids with relatively low temperatures ( â¤370 Â°C ) and low salinity ( 3 - 7 wt % NaClequiv . ) .

The condensat ion of brines and their accumulat ion at shallow level could be an efficient mechanism to concentrate and then precipitate Cu Â± Mo in a small rock volume as represented by the mineralized porphyries .
The temporal and spatial decoupling of Cu and Mo has been documented in many porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) systems ( Sillitoe , 2010 and reference therein ) .
The porphyry intrusions with various who le - rock composit ions ( 62 - 72 wt % SiO2 ) contain 19 abundant inclusion - rich apatite ( ~ 27 - 30 % of all apatite ) that occurs commonly as inclusions in phenocrysts ( e . g . , hornblende and biot ite ) .
The early - stage ID inclusions in deep A1E veins and the two transit ional - stage ID inclusions in quartz phenocrysts of KGP are considered as representative of the least different iated input ID fluids ( Fig . 13A ) .
The vapor - brine immiscibility can lead to contrasting metal partit ioning between these two phases .
The brine phase is also likely the major Mo carrier after phase separat ion , considering the very high Mo / K ratios of a group of brine inclusions ( Fig . 12B ) .
The CL - bright quartz in A2E veins formed coevally with the bulk mo lybdenite and followed by a vo lumetrically much smaller CL - dark quartz ( Fig . 6A - D ) .
The fluid inclusion data , however , cannot explain why a relat ively deep Mo - rich mineralizat ion represented by BT veins formed in the transit ional stage ( Fig . 2 ) , as the ore - forming fluids of the early and transit ional stages are very similar in all the analyzed elements ( Fig . 13 ) .
The early precipitat ion of mo lybdenite from the transit ional - stage single - phase fluids could be triggered by their higher fS2 , acidity and / or lower fO2 than the early - stage single - phase fluids , as such condit ions can significant ly decrease the solubility of Mo ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) .

The high - density brine phase condensed at the deposit level , whereas the low - densit y vapor phase escaped rapidly from the hydrothermal system .
Such fluidâmelt inclusion populat ions are argued to represent the transient exsolut ion of ore - forming fluids ( Harris et al . , 2003 ; Rottier et al . , 2016 ) , which is recent ly realized to be problematic as the high Cu concentration in the melt inclusions is an artefact from experimental re - melt ing ( Rottier et al . , 2017 ) .

( 3 ) Sulfur - rich apatite ( 0 . 3 - 1 . 4 wt % SO3 ) in oxidized fels ic magmas related to porphyry Cu systems and arc volcanos can crystalize from highly evo lved melts in pegmat it ic environment during the so lidificat ion of fels ic magma reservo irs .
Whether Cu and Mo in porphyry - type ore deposits were deposited dominant ly from brines or vapors is hotly debated ( Roedder , 1971 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Seo et al . , 2012 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2015 ) .
Because Cu - Fe sulfides tend to precipitate from the brine phase as discussed above , t he 25 apparent ly deep Mo - rich mineralizat ion of the transit ional stage can be caused by a low degree of phase separat ion to produce Cu - rich brines or by the condensat ion o f a brine phase at a higher level of the deposit .
The giant Eocene Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in eastern Tibet , China was produced by mult istage veining , Cu - Mo sulfide deposit ion , and hydrotherma l alteration associated with pulsed magmat ic intrusions ( i . e . , early , transit ional , and late stages ) last ing for a prolonged period of t ime .
Origin of sulfur - rich magmatic apatite Apat ite in magmat ic rocks may serve as an indicator for sulfur contents of their parental magmas , but the elusive origin o f the sulfur - rich apat ite in felsic magmas has hampered its use as a monitor for magmat ic sulfur evolut ion ( Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2011 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
( 2 ) The single - phase ID fluids o f the early and transit ional stages ( 9 . 1 Â± 3 . 0 wt % NaClequiv .
The higher S / K and As / K ratios in ID and vapor inclusions than in brine inclusions at Yulong ( Fig . A3 ) can be explained by the preferent ial fractionation of S and As into the vapor phase ( Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ) .
The similar element / K ratios of liquid - rich inclusions in the late - stage pyrite - quartz veins to the fluid inclusions in the sulfur - rich apat ite suggest that the late - stage fluids were also likely derived from highly evolved melt fractions in felsic magmas during the solidificat ion of the magma chamber .
Evolution of source magmas and initial ore - forming fluids The Yulong deposit is a long - lived magmatic - hydrothermal system fed by an underlying upper crustal magma chamber ( Chang et al . , 2017 ) .
In this study , fluid inclusion microthermometry and laser ablat ion - ICP - MS microanalysis are combined with textural observat ions on magmat ic apatite and various hydrothermal quartz vein assemblages to constrain the formation and evo lution o f the mult istage magmat ic - hydrothermal fluids producing the Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit .

In addit ion , FIAs in the early - and transit ional - stage quartz veins with obvious features of post - entrapment modification such as defo rmation or decrepitating halos were largely avoided , but several lines o f evidence suggest that the best - preserved ID and brine FIAs still commonly suffered from post - entrapment modification : ( 1 ) the homogenizat ion of some unambiguous bo iling assemblages b y final disso lut ion of halite at much higher temperature than that of bubble disappearance ; ( 2 ) individual ID or brine fluid inclusions in some FIAs show different homogenizat ion behaviors and / or large ranges of homogenizat ion temperature ; and ( 3 ) two thirds of brine inclusion assemblages homogenized to liquid by halite disso lution with a minimum entrapment pressure est imated at up to ~ 3 kbar ( Fig . 10B ; Becker et al . , 2008 ) , whereas the real fluid pressure was likely < 1 kbar ( see below ) .

Secondly , the high - grade Cu and Mo mineralizat ion in shallow parts of the deposit are closely associated with the early - stage quartz veins that contain the highest abundance of brine inclusions ( Fig . 9 ) , supporting the accumulation of the brine phase at this level to form the high - grade Cu and Mo mineralizat ion ( the vapor phase because of its very low - density tends to escape quickly from the system ) .
with ~ 9300 ppm Cu and ~ 330 ppm Mo ) coexist ing with a large amount of vapors ( vapor / brine mass ratio of ~ 4 ) .
Some studies on porphyry Cu systems with preserved mafic to felsic rocks showed that the metal - and sulfur - rich mafic magmas were typically sulfide - undersaturated , whereas andesit ic magmas that formed upon 3 magma mixing commonly contained abundant sulfides with the metals mainly inherited from the mafic magmas ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; AudÃ©tat and Simon , 2012 ) .
However , a few brine inclusion assemblages that homogenize to liquid by halite disso lut ion still likely formed either by further cooling of brine fluids after phase separation or by heterogeneous entrapment of liquid + halite at halite saturated conditions ( Becker et al . , 2008 ) .
Minor amount of chalcopyrite in the transit ional stage precipitated unequivocally later than mo lybdenite ( occurring along the margins of BT veins ; Fig . 3F ) , because the former commonly occurs in the central voids of BT veins or as A3T veins cutting BT veins .
The relat ively low - salinity of the liquid - rich fluids was probably aided by the dilut ion of meteorit ic water ( Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ) .
The sequent ial deposit ion of Mo and Cu from the condensed brine phase of the early stage caused the local Cu - Mo decoupling at shallow levels o f the deposit , whereas the mechanism that formed the deeply located Mo - rich but Cu - poor mineralizat ion of the transit ional stage is less clear .
Sulfur content in apatite crystallized from " normal " rhyo lit ic melts under sulfate - saturated condit ion is unlikely to exceed ~ 0 . 7 wt % SO3 based on results of previous experimental studies and analyses o f natural samples ( see figure 16 in Parat et al . , 2011 ; also see discussion in Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
Therefore , these intrusions either assimilated or mixed with some highly evo lved melt fract ions , from which the sulfur - and fluid - inclusion - rich cores are inherited .
It is notable that rhyo lit ic melts with several thousands ppm Cs ( plus ~ 800 ppm boron ) are very rare and usually confined to pegmat itic environment ( AudÃ©tat and Pettke , 2003 ) .
However , init ial single - phase ID ore - forming fluids ( see below ) of the early and transit ional stage at Yulong were very similar , because the least differentiated ID and brine inclusions from the two stages are essent ially the same in concentrations of all the analyzed elements ( Fig . 13 ) .
are predominant in A1E veins from deep barren zones ( Fig . 9 ) .
( 1 ) The init ial single - phase intermediate - density ( ID ) ore - forming fluids of the early and transit ional stages that formed over a prolonged period of time ( up to ~ 1 . 4 m . y . )
On the other hand , highly evo lved melt inclusions coexist ing with fluid inclusions in quartz phenocrysts and high - temperature quartz veins have been reported in several porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2003 ; Stefanova et al . , 2014 ; Rottier et al . , 2016 ) .
Notably , a similar magmat ic origin has recently been proposed to explain the format ion of the coarse muscovite veins and alterations in the root s of a porphyry copper system related to the Yerington batho lith ( Runyon et al . , 2017 ) .
Considering that the brine phase occupy a much smaller volume than the same mass of vapor phase , condensat ion of the high - densit y brine phase from a low - density input fluid and its accumulat ion at the level o f the vapor - brine immiscibility could thus be an efficient mechanism to concentrate Cu and Mo in a small rock volume .
However , the deeply located Mo - rich mineralizat ion of the transit ional stage could start to precipitate from the single - phase ID fluids before phase separat ion ( Fig . 15B ) .
Geologic evidence and mo lybdenite Re - Os ages on A2E veins revealed at least two pulses o f mineralizat ion during the early stage in the time interval o f 42 . 28 Â± 0 . 17 to 41 . 46 Â± 0 . 17 Ma ( Chang et al . , 2017 ) .
The widespread coeval potassium - rich basalt ic to andesit ic vo lcanic rocks in the Changdu - Simao cont inental block ( Fig . 1A ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) also support the hypothesis that basalt ic to andesit ic magmas played an important role in the format ion of the Yulong deposit .

The format ion of the low - temperature late - stage fluids at the deposit leve l could be caused by the progressive so lidification of the underlying magma chamber without the input of new batches of magmas .
After the intrusion of QAP , the metal - deficient late - stage fluids that formed the DL veins and associated sericit ic alteration exso lved from highly evo lved rhyo lit ic melts during the so lidificat ion of magma chamber , probably due to the lack of new batches o f input magmas ( Fig . 15C ) .
As discussed above , the unusually high Cu / K ratios in ID and vapor inclusions are caused by post - entrapment modificat ion .
Furthermore , the similar element / K rat ios of the liquid - rich inclusions to ID inclusions in magmat ic apat ite implies a common origin for them , i . e . , being derived from highly evo lved melt fractions .
Following the intrusion of MGP and KGP , the single - phase ID fluids decompressed and cooled upon ascending from the underlying magma chamber , and separated at the deposit level into a less abundant brine phase enriched in Cu Â± Mo and a more abundant vapor phase ( vapor / brine mass ratio of ~ 4 ) .
The input of new batches of andesit ic and / or basalt ic magmas into the long - lived upper crustal magma chamber maintained the repeated exsolut ion of composit ionally similar single - phase ID , metal - charged fluids over a long period of ~ 1 . 4 m . y .

It is thus concluded that the Yulong deposit was produced from mult iple magmat ic - hydrothermal pulses spanning a time period of 5 . 13 Â± 0 . 23 m . y . , but the bulk Cu - Mo mineralization likely formed in a shorter but still long interval o f 1 . 36 Â± 0 . 24 m . y .
As is the case for many other porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Bingham Canyon : Keith et al . , 1997 ; Zhang and AudÃ©tat , 2017 ; Grondahl and Zajacz , 2017 ; Alumbrera : Halter et al . , 2005 ; El Teniente : Stern and Skewes , 2005 ) , the ore - forming fluids at Yulong were probably derived from andesit ic magma reservo irs .
The sequent ial deposit ion o f Mo and Cu from the condensed brine phase of the early stage caused the local Cu - Mo decoupling in shallow parts of the deposit , whereas the deeply located Mo - rich mineralization of the transit ional stage was probably caused by the early precipitat ion of mo lybdenite from the single - phase ID fluids before phase separation .
Similar scenario applies to the high Cs - content of the fluid inclusions .
A possible explanat ion is that mo lybdenite precipitated preferentially from the single - phase ID fluids during the transit ional stage .
The sequent ial precipitation of Mo and Cu is consistent with the vein chrono logy and vein - texture observat ions .
Therefore , the precipitat ion of chalcopyrite paragenet ically later than the bulk quartz veins at Yulong suggests that the precipitat ion of most Cu was probably driven by further cooling of the brine phase at pressure close to hydrostatic ( Landtwing et al , 2005 ) .
Firstly , the least different iated brine inclusions with high concentrations o f Mo ( 330 Â± 90 ppm ) and Cu ( 9300 Â± 3200 ppm ) only occur in the barren EBE and A1E & T veins , whereas more than half of brine inclusions in A2E and BT veins that contain mo lybdenite Â± chalcopyrite have similar Cu concentration but much lower Mo concentration ( 10 - 100 ppm ) ( Fig . 14 ) .
It could be a common phenomenon in long - lived porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) systems that pulses o f ore - forming fluids derived from the magma chamber are composit ionally similar over a prolonged period of time , considering that the other two well - studied giant porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits ( i . e . , Bingham Canyon and E l Teniente ) also show similar composit ion in different stages of ore - forming fluids that bracket a ore - forming history of ~ 1 m . y .
The appearance of the late and more mafic QAP dikes indicates that the underlying magma chamber at Yulong behaved as an open system .
Consequent ly , the format ion of a late Mo - rich mineralizat ion ( similar to the transit ional - stage mineralizat ion at Yulong ) in many porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 and reference therein ) are likely caused by subso lidus hydrothermal processes rather than the progressive increase of Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and 27 Holland , 1986 ) .
Therefore , it is unlikely that these sulfur - rich cores of magmat ic apatite have formed from " normal " melt s . A more possible scenario is that these sulfur - rich cores crystallized from pegmat it ic melt s , which is expected in the process of so lidification o f fels ic magma reservo irs in the underlying magma chamber .
The early - and transit ional - stage brine inclusions in EBE and A1E & T veins with high Cu and Mo concentrations likely represent the least differentiated brines ( Fig . 13B ) , as these barren veins are pre - mineralizat ion and only occasionally overprinted by some late chalcopyrite Â± pyrite .

The evidence concerning the behavior of Mo in the two fluid phases is less clear ( Wilkinson et al . , 4 2008 ; Seo et al . , 2012 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2015 ) , despite recent experimental studies suggest that Mo strongly part it ions into brines upon phase separation ( Kokh et al . , 2016 ; Zajacz et al . , 2017 ) .
It is concluded that the format ion of a late Mo - rich mineralizat ion ( similar to the transit ional - stage mineralizat ion at Yulong ) in many other porphyry Cu deposits is due to the subso lidus hydrothermal processes rather than the progressive increase o f the Mo / Cu ratio in residual parental melt s as magma crystallizat ion proceeds .
In this paper , we present an integrated textural and fluid inclusion study o f the Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit , using optical microscope - and scanning electron microscope - cathodoluminescence ( Opt ical - and SEM - CL ) imaging of magmat ic apatite and hydrothermal quartz veins , electron microprobe ( EMP ) analysis o f magmat ic apatite , and petrography , microthermometry and laser ablat ion - induct ively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) analysis of fluid inclusions hosted in magmat ic apat ite and quartz veins .
Nevertheless , it is unclear whether the transit ional - stage Mo mineralizat ion precipitate dominant ly from the single - phase ID fluids or from the brine phase .
Therefore , the experimentally determined Cu partitioning coefficient of 0 . 11 - 0 . 15 between vapor and brine ( Lerchbaumer and AudÃ©tat , 2012 ) are used for a mass balance calculat ion : using the vapor / brine mass ratio on the order of 4 , the total amount of Cu in the brine phase is about 2 times higher than that in the vapor phase .
During the early - stage mineralizat ion , Mo and Cu precipitated successively from the brine phase after further decompression , cooling , and / or fluid - rock reaction , which caused the locally decoupled Cu - Mo mineralizat ion ( Fig . 15A ) .
Interpretation of microthermometric results Post - entrapment modification of fluid inclusions is common in porphyry systems but has not been sufficient ly considered in the interpretation of fluid inclusion data .
Such modificat ion may result in changes in bulk fluid inclusion density ( e . g . , stretching or shrinkage ; Roedder , 1984 ) and gain or loss o f materials ( e . g . , H2 and H2O ) that may change both fluid inclusion composit ion and bulk density ( AudÃ©tat and Gunther , 1999 ) .
This view is confirmed by the fact that the ID and vapor inclusions with higher S / K ratio also contain higher Cu / K ratio , but there is no such correlat ion between S / K and Cu / K ratios in brine inclusions ( Fig . A4 ) .
Recent experimental studies suggest that the high Cu concentrations in vapor - dominated fluid inclusions in quartz are caused by post - entrapment diffusion , and thus favored that Cu is most ly transported by hypersaline brines ( Lerchbaumer and AudÃ©tat , 2012 ) .
The relat ively consistent salinity o f most ID and brine FIAs indicate that changes in bulk density and / or slight gain or loss of material have little influence on 20 salinity , whereas the homogenizat ion temperatures of most ID and brine inclusions are considered unreliable .
These trends strongly suggest that ( 1 ) the brine phase was an important carrier for both Cu and Mo after phase separat ion , ( 2 ) Mo started to precipitate earlier than Cu , and ( 3 ) 24 the bulk o f Mo could precipitate either from the single - phase ID fluids or from the brine phase , whereas the bulk o f Cu likely precipitated from the br ine phase .
For the above reasoning , the total amounts of Cu and Mo in the brine phase are higher than those in the vapor phase .
The fo llowing two lines of evidence suggest that brines indeed played a significant role at Yulong .
Alternat ively , other authors have suggested that fluid exso lution from crystallizing basalt ic to andesit ic magmas without sulfide saturation is more than adequate to form large porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Stern and Skewes , 2005 ; Richards , 2015 ; Grondahl and Zajacz , 2017 ) .
5 . 6 An integrated model and comparison with other porphyry Cu deposits Based on the above discussion , an integrated model o f the format ion and 26 evo lut ion of the mult istage magmat ic - hydrothermal fluids at Yulong is developed ( Fig . 15 ) .
An important observat ion in this study is that the S - rich domain ( 0 . 3 - 1 . 4 wt % SO3 ) of apatite is coupled with the fluid Â± melt inclusions - rich core of the same apat ite grains , and that the melt - and fluid inclusions display an extremely evo lved nature marked by unusually high Cs concentrations ( Table 4A ; Fig . 12 ) .
A model that invokes the input of new batches of 22 andesit ic and / or basalt ic magmas into the magma chamber can well explain the repeated exsolut ion of similar ore - forming fluids during a prolonged period of time ( Annen , 2009 ; Gelman et al . , 2013 ; Tapster et al . , 2016 ) .

During their ascent , decompression and cooling , the single - phase ID input fluids ( ~ 9 wt % NaClequiv .
This study highlights the relat ively constant init ial ore - forming fluids produced by an open - system upper crustal magma chamber in porphyry Cu deposits , the significance of hypersaline brines in concentrat ing and precipitating Cu Â± Mo , and the production of the late - stage infert ile fluids from highly evo lved fels ic melt s .
A recent experimental study and a comparat ive study of vapor and brine inclusions from coexisting quartz and topaz in natural samples indicate that S - rich vapor inclusions in quartz experienced a dramat ic increase in Cu , whereas brine inclusions remained largely unmodified ( Lerchbaumer and AudÃ©tat , 2012 ; Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
A recent experimental study suggests that an increase in CO2 concentration in the fluids to up to ~ 4 mo l % may decrease the so lubility o f Mo as well ( Kokh et al . , 2017 ) .
Diffusion of those elements is consistent with the fact that univalent ions with a small radium diffuse rapidly through channels of quartz structure .
In addition , this study provides a new model for the origin o f pyrite + quartz veins ( D veins ) and associated sericit ic alteration that form after the bulk ores in nearly all porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits ( Harris et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
; 9300 Â± 3200 ppm Cu and 330 Â± 90 ppm Mo ) and a large amount of low - density vapor phase with a vapor / brine mass ratio of ~ 4 ; the condensation and accumulat ion of metal - rich brines at the deposit level was likely crit ical for the concentration and precipitat ion ( during subsequent cooling of these brines ) of Cu Â± Mo in a small rock volume .
Similar variat ions ( 0 - 2 wt % SO3 ) have also been documented for apatite from oxidized , fels ic magmas related to porphyry Cu systems and arc vo lcanos elsewhere ( Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2002 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
Similar variat ions ( 0 - 2 wt % SO3 ) have also been documented for apatite from oxidized , fels ic magmas related to porphyry Cu systems and arc vo lcanos elsewhere ( Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2002 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
and 79 wt % vapor with a salinity of 0 . 1 wt % NaClequiv . , and the vapor / brine mass ratio would be 4 based on the H2O - NaCl sys tem ( Driesner and Heinrich , 2007 ) .
The results are used to constrain the format ion and evo lution of the mult istage magmat ic - hydrothermal fluids of the deposit .
This inconsistency requires an alternative explanation for the origin of sulfur - rich apatite .
The transit ional - stage mineralizat ion , which is mainly represented by BT veins , formed rapidly from 40 . 98 Â± 0 . 23 to 40 . 92 Â± 0 . 17 Ma .
5 . 5 Formation and evolution of the late - stage fluids The format ion of widespread DL veins and closely associated sericit ic alterat ion assemblages ( pyrite - quartz - muscovite Â± illite ) after the intrusion o f QAP dikes marks a waning stage of the metal - charged magmat ic - hydrothermal system ( Chang et al . , 2017 ) .
were composit ionally similar ; these fluids were likely derived from similarly evo lved andesit ic ( ? )
This interpretation is in agreement with a recent experimental study for Mo partit ioning between brine and vapor ( Kokh et al . , 2016 ; Zajacz et al . , 2017 ) .
The second pulse of intermediate - density ore - forming fluids at Questa contained ~ 20 times higher Cs concentration than the first one , observations interpreted to reflect major crystal fract ionat ion of the source magma ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ) .
Ore - forming fluids o f the transit ional stage probably fo llowed a similar evo lut ion path , as the same fluid inclusion types were observed in A1T and BT veins .
23 This could be one of the common scenarios for the early - and transit ional - stage fluid evo lut ion , but the vapor / brine mass ratio can vary in the range of 2 - 9 by changing the input parameters in geologically realist ic condit ions .
; ~ 1000 ppm Cu and 22 Â± 19 ppm Mo ) entered the two - phase field upon ascent and separated into a small amount of metal - rich brine phase ( 42 . 0 Â± 4 . 5 wt % NaClequiv .
( 4 ) The metal deficient late - stage fluids ( 28 from highly evo lved rhyo lit ic melts during the solidificat ion of the magma chamber .
The prolonged durat ion for the bulk ore format ion at Yulong potentially indicates significant composit ional variat ion of the magmat ic hydrothermal fluids as a result of extended magma fractionation ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .
Two significant ly younger , noneconomic mineralizat ion events ( 39 . 56 Â± 0 . 17 and 37 . 15 Â± 0 . 15 Ma ) postdated the intrusion of QAP dikes .

Middle Jurassic ( 160 - 180 Ma ) intra - plate alkaline basalts and gabbros , bimodal volcanic - intrusive complexes ( Fig . 1b ; Zhao et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c , and Jurassic extensional sedimentary basins ( Gilder et al . , 1996 ) are all observed in this region .
Petrogenesis of the Dexing adakitic porphyries
The Dexing adakitic porphyries have Nd isotopic compositions similar to those ( at T Â¼ 171 Ma ) of the ophiolites ( Fig . 7b ) , suggesting that they could be derived by partial melting of the remnants of a Neoproterozoic subducted slab , stalled in the mantle .
The Dexing adakitic porphyries are similar to the adakites derived from subducted oceanic crust ( Defant & Drummond , 1990 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 1995 ; Stern & Kilian , 1996 ; AguillÃ³n - Robles et al . , 2001 ; Defant et al . 2002 ; Bourdon et al . , 2002 ) , adakitic rocks derived from delaminated lower crust ( Xu et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b and metabasaltic and eclogite experimental melts hybridized by peridotite ( Rapp et al . , 1999 ) in terms of their FeO T / MgO , Al 2 O 3 , .
Geodynamic model for generating the Dexing adakitic porphyries
Lower crustal delamination may represent an important process in the differentiation of the continental lithosphere ( Ducea & Saleeby , 1998 ) .
Partial melting of the delaminated lower crust might have been triggered by the Middle Jurassic extension of the Shi - Hang rift .
Porphyry copper deposits are generally derived from sulfur - rich , highly oxidized magmatic systems , with oxygen fugacities ( f O 2 ) between the nickel - nickel oxide ( NNO ) or sulfide - sulfur oxide ( SSO ) and magnetitehematite oxygen ( MH ) buffers ( Imai et al . , 1993 ; Sillitoe , 1997 ; OyarzÃºn et al . , 2001 ; Mungall , 2002 ) .
Melts or fluid derived from the slab will carry this oxidizing potential up into the overlying mantle and destabilize mantle sulfides to release Cu and Au ( McInnes & Cameron , 1994 ; Sillitoe , 1997 ; Mungall , 2002 ) .
Slab - derived adakitic magmas are more favorable for the generation of Cu - Au deposits than slab - derived CO 2 - or H 2 O - or SO 3 - bearing fluids , owing to their higher Fe 2 O 3 content ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
lower crust - derived Ningzhen , Yueshan and Tongshankou adakitic rocks are associated with epithermalporphyry Cu deposits ( Tang et al . , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b .

chalcopyrite and bornite ) ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ; Rui et al . , 1984 ) .
The Dexing porphyries were generated in the Middle Jurassic ( 171 AE 3 Ma ) , and occur near to the Middle Jurassic - Cretaceous Shi - Hang rift zone ( Fig . 1b ; Goodell et al . , 1991 ; Gilder et al . , 1996 ) ; therefore , it is reasonable to conclude that they were also emplaced in an extensional tectonic setting in the interior of the continent rather than in a subduction zone setting .
The Proterozoic rocks appear to have played an important role in the generation of the Mesozoic igneous rocks ( Chen & Jahn , 1998 ) .
The oldest rocks exposed in the Dexing and adjacent areas are Proterozoic in age ( Fig . 1c ) .
The Dexing adakitic porphyries exhibit the typical geochemical characteristics of adakites , e . g .
The metallic sulfides in the mantle are oxidized , which causes the chalcophile elements to enter the adakitic magma .
The Dexing adakitic porphyries ( quartz diorite - granodiorite porphyries ) , associated with giant porphyry Cu deposits , are located in the interior of a continent ( South China ) .
The high f O 2 could have induced oxidation of metallic sulfides in the mantle and mobilization of chalcophile elements , which are required to produce associated Cu mineralization .
The Dexing adakitic porphyries have the highest e Nd ( t ) and lowest initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios of the Late Mesozoic magmatic rocks of the eastern Yangtze Block , including mafic rocks ( Figs 7a and 8 ) , indicating that they could not have been generated through an AFC process from contemporaneous mafic magmas .
The Nd - Sr isotopic compositions of the Dexing adakites , which are comparable with those of coeval basaltic magmas from the Cathaysia Block ( Li et al . , 2003 ( Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c and to those of adakitic rocks derived by partial melting of newly underplated basaltic lower crust ( Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Muir et al . , 1995 ; Petford & Atherton , 1996 ; Fig . 7a ) , invite speculation that they may have occurred due to partial melting newly underplated , thickened , lower crust .
The crustal AFC curve is after Stern & Killian ( 1996 ) ( Curve 3 ) .
The resultant melt rises through a zone of mantle peridotite en route to its emplacement in the upper crust , with significant chemical interaction between the mantle peridotite and the crustal melt ( Fig . 10 ) .
The Nd isotopic compositions of the metamorphic arc volcanic rocks and metasediments of the Shuangxiwu Group ( Fig . 8 ) are the closest to those of the Dexing adakitic porphyries .
high La / Yb , Sr / Y ratios and low Y and Yb contents ( Table 2 ; Figs 4b and 6 ) , suggesting that garnet was stable within the source residues when the adakitic magmas were segregated ( Defant & Drummond , 1990 ; Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Rapp & Watson , 1995 ; Rapp et al . , 1999Rapp et al . , , 2003 .
The chalcophile elements are mainly stored in mantle sulfides ( e . g .
The adakitic melts are produced by partial melting of delaminated lower crust , which is heated by the surrounding relatively hot mantle , coupled with the flux of heat from the upwelling asthenosphere .
The adakitic melts react with the surrounding mantle peridotite , elevating their MgO , Cr and Ni contents but reducing their FeO T / MgO ratios .
( b ) Nd model age ( T DM ) vs e Nd ( t ) Â¼ 171 Ma for the Dexing adakitic porphyries compared with Proterozoic metamorphic rocks from the Yangtze Block ( Chen & Jahn , 1998 ) , Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of cover strata from the Yangtze Block ( Chen & Jahn , 1998 ) , Proterozoic ophiolites from the northeastern Jiangxi Province ( Li et al . , 1997 ) , Middle Jurassic ( 168 - 178 Ma ) within - plate basalts and gabbros in the Cathaysia Block and 400 - 179 Ma MORB .
( 1 ) Middle Jurassic ( 171 AE 3 Ma ) adakitic porphyries and associated porphyry copper deposits in the Dexing area were generated in an extensional tectonic regime in the interior of a continent , rather than in an arc setting .
( c ) Late Jurassic - present , accompanying lower crustal delamination , surface erosion , and lithospheric or crustal extension result in the present - day thinned crust .
( 2 ) The Dexing adakitic porphyries were probably derived from dehydration melting of delaminated mafic lower crust in the mantle at pressures greater than 1Ã2 GPa , leaving residual garnet AE amphibole in their source .
( 2 ) The Dexing adakitic porphyries were probably derived from dehydration melting delaminated mafic lower crust in the mantle at pressures greater than 1Ã2 GPa , leaving residual garnet AE amphibole in their source .
As the continental crust at this time was probably over - thickened , as a consequence of Triassic compression in South China ( e . g .
As the adakitic magmas directly derived by partial melting of a thick lower crustal source do not subsequently pass through mantle rocks , in which the chalcophile elements are mainly stored , they rarely have the potential to generate Cu - Au mineralization .
If these adakitic magmas were generated by partial melting of such a stalled slab , then it is possible that they interacted with the mantle during ascent , and as a consequence they exhibit higher MgO ( or Mg - number ) , Cr , Ni and Yb ( Figs 5e - h and 10 ) but slightly lower FeO T / MgO and Al 2 O 3 ( Fig . 5c and d ) relative to experimental melts of basaltic rocks ( Sen & Dunn , 1994 ; Rapp et al . , 1991Rapp et al . , , 1999Rapp et al . , , 2002Rapp et al . , , 2003Rapp & Watson , 1995 ; Prouteau et al . , 1999 ; Skjerlie & PatiÃ±o Douce , 2002 , and references therein ) , and pure slab melts ( Sorensen & Grossman , 1989 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 1995 ) ( Mg - number < 47 ) .
Sensitive High - Resolution Ion Microprobe ( SHRIMP ) geochronology studies of zircons reveal that the Dexing adakitic porphyries have a crystallization age of 171 AE 3 Ma .
Extensive granitic and intermediate - acid volcanic rocks of Cretaceous and Jurassic age are exposed in East China ( Fig . 1b ) .
Two major crust - forming events are represented by the Banxi - Sibao Groups ( NW Yangtze , $1800 Ma ) and the Shangxi - Shuangqiaoshan Groups ( SE Yangtze , $1400 Ma ) .
Favorable tectonic settings for the generation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with slab melting are subduction of very young lithosphere or very slow or oblique convergence , flat subduction , and the presence of a dead or stalled slab ( Sillitoe , 1997 ; Mungall , 2002 ) .
( 3 ) The Dexing porphyry Cu deposit was formed under high f O 2 conditions .
( 4 ) The metallogenesis of the Dexing porphyry Cu deposits is intimately related to the petrogenesis of the adakites , indicating that an adakitic magma derived from delaminated lower crust also has the potential to generate porphyry Cu - Au deposits similar to slab - derived adakitic magmas .
Samples of the Dexing adakitic porphyries have relatively high e Nd , suggesting a significant depleted mantle component is involved in their petrogenesis .
( 3 ) High Th contents and Th / Ce ratios indicate that the Dexing adakitic magmas include a lower continental crustal component .
The field of metabasaltic and eclogite experimental melts hybridized with peridotite is after Rapp et al . ( 1999 ) .
Therefore , the Dexing adakitic porphyries were unlikely to have been produced by partial melting of anhydrous mantle peridotite .
As effusive rhyolites and tuffs of the late Jurassic Ehu formation are still preserved in the Dexing area ( Fig . 1d ) , the $10 km thick upper crust cannot have been thinned by surface erosion since the formation of the adakitic rocks .
Therefore , adakites derived by slab melting have been recognized as being particularly effective agents of Cu - Au mineralization ( ThiÃ©blemont et al . , 1997 ; OyarzÃºn , et al . , 2001 ; Defant et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ) and , consequently , have been regarded as important indicators in gold and copper exploration ( Defant et al . , 2002 ) .
Since then , adakites have frequently been suggested as possible examples of partial melts of subducted oceanic crust ( e . g .
The field of metabasaltic and eclogite experimental melts ( 1 - 4Ã0 GPa ) is from the following : Rapp et al . ( 1991Rapp et al . ( , 1999Rapp et al . ( , 2002 ; Sen & Dunn ( 1994 ) ; Rapp & Watson ( 1995 ) ; Prouteau et al . ( 1999 ) ; Skjerlie & PatiÃ±o Douce ( 2002 ) , and references therein .
In addition , the adakitic porphyries are similar to highly oxidized I - type or magnetite - series granitoids ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ; Rui et al . , 1984 ) .
In addition , A - type granites and alkali gabbro - aegirine syenite suites with ages of 165 - 172 Ma have been reported ( Li et al . , 2003 ) .
These include metamorphic , arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks , and ophiolites .

These include metamorphic , arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks , and ophiolites .
Moreover , the Dexing adakitic magmas must have interacted with the surrounding mantle peridotite during their ascent , which elevated not only their MgO , Cr and Ni contents , but also the oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) of the mantle .
Models 1 - 3 : Slab melting , AFC process and lower crustal melting
To the east of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 1c ) , there is a suite of Neoproterozoic ( $1000 Ma ) ophiolitic melanges that occur as discrete lenses along the Yiyang - Dexing fault zone ( Chen et al . , 1991 ; Li et al . , 1997 ) .
Moreover , any slab subducted into the convecting mantle would have sunk to the bottom of the upper ( or even lower ) mantle quite rapidly ; additionally , the lithosphere itself will have moved significantly since 1000 Ma and it seems impossible that it could still be sitting above the same part of the convecting mantle in the Jurassic .
During partial melting of delaminated lower crust in the middle Jurassic ( Fig . 12b ) , adakitic magmas with high Fe 2 O 3 contents interacted with the surrounding mantle peridotite , increasing the oxidation state of the mantle to beyond the SSO buffer , causing metallic sulfides in the mantle to be consumed ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
Therefore , the Cu metallogenesis associated with the Dexing adakitic porphyries is probably related to partial melting of delaminated lower crust , similar to the metallogenesis accompanying slab melting .
Except for some ophiolites and metamorphic rocks which have e Nd ( t ) values at 171 Ma close to those of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Figs 7b and 8 ) , the majority of the local lower crustal rocks have lower e Nd ( 171 Ma ) than those of the adakites .
The delaminated lower crust begins to partially melt when it sinks into the underlying mantle .
In addition , the Nd - Sr isotopic signatures of the Dexing adakitic porphyries also confirm that a mantle component probably played a role in their petrogenesis ( Figs 7 and 8 ) .
The transport of chalcophile elements from the mantle by magmas will occur if sulfide phases are completely consumed during partial melting ; this requires the oxidation state of the mantle to be up to values of log f O 2 > FMQ ( fayalitemagnetite - quartz oxygen buffer ) Ã¾ 2 ( i . e .
The occurrence of adakitic rocks and associated large - scale copper deposits in an extensional tectonic setting provides a good opportunity for understanding the genetic relationship between adakitic magmatism and porphyry Cu - Au mineralization .

Model 5 : Partial melting of delaminated lower crust
Model 5 : Partial melting delaminated lower crust
The upper part of subducted oceanic crust has a very high intrinsic f O 2 due to equilibration with seawater during hydrothermal alteration and deposition of terrigenous sediment ( e . g .
Owing to extensive hydrothermal alteration , the available Rb - Sr and K - Ar ages of the porphyries are unreliable and fall in a wide range from 193 to 112 Ma ( early Jurassic - Cretaceous ) ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ; Hua & Dong , 1984 ; Rui et al . , 1984 ; Zhu et al . , 1990 ; Chen & Jahn , 1998 ; Jin et al . , 2002 ) .
Consequently , the crustal thickness in the Dexing area must have been at least 40 km when the adakitic porphyries were formed in the Middle Jurassic .
As a consequence , conduction of heat from the underlying asthenosphere heated both the lithospheric mantle and the source ( delaminated lower crust ) of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 12b ) .
On the basis of the tectonic setting , geochemical characteristics , and zircon U - Pb dating the first three models appear unlikely explanations for the petrogenesis of the Dexing adakitic porphyries , whereas the latter two models seem more plausible .
In the west of both North and South America , lower crustal delamination has been suggested on the basis of xenolith studies , magmatism and geophysical evidence Ducea & Saleeby , 1998 ; Zandt et al . , 2004 ) .
We suggest that the mantle source of the chalcophile elements plays a crucial role in the Cu mineralization of the Dexing area , as supported by following evidence .
However , their high MgO , Cr and Ni contents as well as low initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr and FeO T / MgO values and high eNd ( t ) values suggest that the adakitic magmas include a significant mantle component , contributed by interaction between the crustal melts and the surrounding mantle peridotite .
Fields of delaminated lower crust - derived adakitic rocks , subducted oceanic crust - derived adakites and thick lower crust - derived adakitic rocks are constructed using the same data sources as those in Fig . 4 .
However , the present crustal thickness in the Dexing area is only $31 km ( Fig . 11 ; Wang , 1992 ; Ma et al . , 1994 ; Tang et al . , 1998 ) .
At the same time , the f O 2 of the surrounding mantle may have become elevated .
They named these rocks adakites , following the terminology of Kay ( 1978 ) , who was the first to attribute a slab - melting scenario for similar rocks at Adak Island in the Aleutian arc .
They exhibit relatively high MgO , Cr , Ni and Sr contents , high La / Yb and Sr / Y ratios , but low Yb and Y contents , similar to adakites produced by slab melting associated with subduction .
Although the samples of the Dexing porphyries could be interpreted as showing a slight fractional crystallization trend in a plot of La / Yb vs Yb ( Fig . 9a ) , the data are more consistent with a partial melting trend ( Fig . 9a ) , suggesting that the effects of source partial melting were more important than fractional crystallization in controlling the compositional variation within the Dexing adakitic porphyries .
We now consider possible geodynamic scenarios that might lead to delamination and partial melting of the lower crust in the Jurassic .
The high density of such garnet - bearing mafic rocks in the lower crust leads to delamination Ducea & Saleeby , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b or foundering ( Arndt & Goldstein , 1989 ; Ducea & Saleeby , 1998 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Zandt et al . , 2004 ) .
Their high Th contents and Th / Ce ratios , and Middle Jurassic age , argue against an origin from a Neoproterozoic ( $1000 Ma ) stalled slab in the mantle .
Therefore , an extensional tectonic regime in South China was possibly initiated in the Middle Jurassic ( Gilder et al . , 1996 3 ; adakitic rocks directly derived from a thick crust ( lower crustal melting ) are after Atherton & Petford ( 1993 ) , Muir et al . ( 1995 ) and Petford & Atherton ( 1996 ) ; Cenozoic subducted oceanic crust - derived adakites are after Defant et al . ( 1992 ) , , Sajona et al . ( 2000 ) and AguillÃ³n - Robles et al . ( 2001 ) ; 400 - 179 Ma MORB are from Mahoney et al . ( 1998 , Tribuzio et al . ( 2004 ) and Xu & Castillo ( 2004 ) ; delaminated lower crust - derived adakitic rocks are from Xu et al . ( 2002 ) and Wang et al . ( 2004aWang et al . ( , 2004b ; the Hongzhen Cretaceous adakitic granites are from Wang et al . ( 2004a ) ; Jurassic - Cretaceous mafic and intermediate - acid rocks in the eastern Yangtze Block are from Chen & Jahn ( 1998 ) , Wang ( 2000 ) , Xu et al . ( 2002 ) and Wang et al . ( 2003aWang et al . ( , 2003c ; Middle Jurassic ( 168 - 178 Ma ) within - plate basalts and gabbros in the Cathaysia Block are from Li et al . ( 2003Li et al . ( , 2004 and Wang et al . ( 2003bWang et al . ( , 2004c .
In addition , the source of the Dexing adakitic porphyries clearly contains a significant mantle component with a depleted Nd isotopic composition ( Figs 7 and 8 ) ; this is different from that of the lower crust - derived adakitic rocks in the eastern Yangtze Block ( e . g .
Implications for genesis of porphyry copper deposits
It should be noted that most Cenozoic adakites occur in arc settings ( Defant & Drummond , 1990 ; Defant et al . , 2002 ) .
However , in this study , new Sensitive High - Resolution Ion Microprobe ( SHRIMP ) zircon geochronology data show that the porphyries were intruded in the Middle Jurassic ( 171 AE 3 Ma ) , synchronous with an extensional tectonic event rather than in a compressional tectonic regime ( Gilder et al . , 1996 ; Zhao et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c .
For example , in the eastern Yangtze Block , the Hongzhen adakitic rocks , which are considered to be directly produced by partial melting of thick lower crust , are barren of Cu - Au mineralization ( Fig . 1b ; Wang et al . , 2004a ) , whereas the delaminated ( Gilder et al . ( 1996 ) ) ; at the same time , the thick lower crust is removed through delamination .
These include : ( 1 ) partial melting of a subducting oceanic slab ( e . g .
In southern China , the famous Dexing large - scale porphyry copper deposits are closely associated with late Mesozoic adakitic porphyries ( Wang et al . , 2003a ) .
Castillo et al . 1999 ) ; ( 3 ) partial melting of mafic rocks in the lower part of a thickened crust ( Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Muir et al . , 1995 ; Petford & Atherton , 1996 ; Xiong et al . , 2003 ) ; ( 4 ) partial melting of a stalled ( or dead ) slab in the mantle ( Pe - Piper & Piper , 1994 ; Defant et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) ; ( 5 ) partial melting of delaminated lower crust Xu et al . , 2002 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b .
Nevertheless , most samples of the Dexing adakitic porphyries have higher MgO ( or Mg - number ) , Cr and Ni , but lower FeO T / MgO and Al 2 O 3 contents , relative to adakitic rocks derived by this process ( Figs 5c - g and 10 ) , suggesting that they were unlikely to have been derived by partial melting of underplated basaltic rocks during the Middle Jurassic .
Nevertheless , most samples of the Dexing adakitic porphyries have higher MgO ( or Mg - number ) , Cr and Ni , but lower FeO T / MgO and Al 2 O 3 contents , relative to adakitic rocks derived by this process ( Figs 5c - g and 10 ) , suggesting that they were unlikely to have been derived by partial melting underplated basaltic rocks during the Middle Jurassic .
However , it must be noted that the Dexing adakitic porphyries have distinctly higher Th contents and Th / Ce ratios than subducted slab - derived adakites ( Fig . 5i and j ) , which weakens the possibility that they originated from a stalled slab .
As noted above , in addition to garnet , their source is also inferred to have contained residual amphibole , as indicated by the concave MREE patterns of the adakites ( Fig . 6 a and b ) .
A plot of the compatible element Ni vs the incompatible element Th ( Fig . 9b ) further supports that the suggestion that fractional crystallization could not have produced the geochemical variation within the Dexing adakitic porphyries .
Moreover , the lack of inherited zircons ( Fig . Jahn , 1998 ) .
The third event is represented by the Shuangxiwu Group ( $1000 - 875 Ma ) .
On the assumption that the initial adakitic magmas derived by partial melting of such delaminated lower crustal rocks and subsequently interacted with the overlying mantle during their ascent , the effect would be to increase the e Nd ( 171 Ma ) of the resulting adakitic magmas ( Figs 7b and 8 ) .
Consequently , it is possible that partial melting of delaminated lower crust could have generated the Dexing adakitic rocks ; the amount of interaction with the surrounding mantle would directly correlate with the e Nd ( 171 Ma ) of the lower crust .
Mungall ( 2002 ) proposed that only slab - derived adakitic magmas or supercritical fluids would have a sufficiently high oxidation potential to generate epithermal and porphyry Cu - Au deposits , and , conversely , that adakitic magmas derived by melting of underplated basaltic or gabbroic rocks in the lower crust would retain the low f O 2 of their source and not be favorable for the generation of Cu - Au deposits .
This value is very close to that of chondrites ( 0 - 0Ã7â° ) , suggesting that the sulfur was mainly derived from a mantle source .
Mungall ( 2002 ) concluded that only slab - derived melts , or supercritical fluids with high oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) had the potential to generate associated epithermal and porphyry Cu - Au deposits , as adakitic magmas derived due to basaltic or gabbroic lower crustal melting should retain the low f O 2 of their source .
Following the same calculation as for adakitic magma derived from slab melting ( Mungall , 2002 ) , it is found that 1 g of adakitic melt derived from partial melting of delaminated lower crust could oxidize the same amount of sulfide contained in 160 g of mantle peridotite as an adakitic magma derived from slab melting .
Accordingly , the relationship between adakites and associated porphyry Cu - Au mineralization needs to be further re - examined or clarified .
Although it has been proposed that the Late Mesozoic magmatism in southeast China may have been related to westward subduction of the paleo - Pacific plate ( e . g .
( 2 ) The d 34 S values of sulfide and sulfate from the Dexing porphyry Cu deposits range from Ã4Ã0 to Ã¾3Ã1â° , with an average value of Ã¾0Ã12â° ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ; Rui et al . , 1984 ) .
Accordingly , we strongly suggest that adakitic magmas derived by partial melting of delaminated lower crust could be just as favorable for the generation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 12 ) as slab - derived adakitic magmas .
Recently , it has been proposed that the Late Mesozoic magmatism of South China was formed in an extensional tectonic setting rather than above a subduction zone ( Li et al . , 2003 ( Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c .
These provide strong evidence against an arc setting , as peralkaline igneous rocks have not been reported to occur in subduction - related tectonic settings .
Moreover , it is questionable whether the Neoproterozoic subducted slab could have stayed in the mantle until the Middle Jurassic without being subjected to melting , because after the Neoproterozoic ( 1000 - 900 Ma ) collision between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks , South China went through a complex tectonic evolution from the Neoproterozoic to the early Jurassic , including mantle superplume activities at 860 - 750 Ma ( Li et al . , 2002a ( Li et al . , , 2002b .
In this case , the delaminated section of the lower crust is heated by the surrounding relatively hot mantle and undergoes partial melting ( e . g .
Thus , it is very difficult to distinguish lower crust - derived adakitic rocks in arc settings from subducting slab - derived adakites that may be contaminated by crustal material during their ascent to the surface ( e . g .
Recently , it has also been recognized that adakites are often associated with Cu - Au mineralization ( ThiÃ©blemont et al . , 1997 ; OyarzÃºn et al . , 2001 ; Defant et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting a genetic relationship between slab melting and Cu - Au mineralization .
Xu et al . ( 2002 ) also concluded that the Cretaceous adakitic intrusive rocks in the Yangtze block were derived from delaminated lower crust .
It is generally believed that reaction between pure slab melts and surrounding peridotite in the sub - arc mantle wedge ( e . g .
Defant & Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that partial melting of a subducting oceanic slab at sufficient depths for garnet to be stable within the residual assemblage ( i . e .
Accordingly , it is still difficult to interpret the Dexing adakitic porphyries as partial melts of a subducted slab stalled in mantle , although we cannot completely rule out this possibility .
Experimental results ( Baker et al . , 1995 ) for partial melting of anhydrous lherzolite also show that liquid compositions are not more silicic than andesite ( $55 % SiO 2 ) even at melt fractions as low as 2 % .
The relatively high SiO 2 ( 60 - 70 % ) contents of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 4a ; Table 2 ) indicate that they could not be directly generated by partial melting mantle peridotite because low degree partial melting of mantle peridotite can yield melts only as silicic as basaltic andesite , or boninite rather than dacite in composition ( Green , 1980 ; Jahn & Zhang , 1984 ) .

However , they are characterized by bulk Earth - like Nd - Sr isotope compositions ( e Nd ( t ) Â¼ - 1Ã14 to Ã¾1Ã80 and ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i Â¼ 0Ã7044 - 0Ã7047 ) , and high Th ( 12Ã6 - 27Ã2 ppm ) contents and Th / Ce ( 0Ã19 - 0Ã94 ) ratios , which are different from those of Cenozoic slab - derived adakites .
In this paper , we present a detailed account of the geochronology , petrology and geochemistry of the Middle Jurassic Dexing adakitic porphyries and address the petrogenesis and the relationship between these adakitic rocks and their associated Cu mineralization .
Nevertheless , it has been recently recognized that some Cenozoic adakitic rocks derived by lower crustal melting are also associated with porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( e . g .
On the other hand , it has also been suggested that some adakitic rocks may be derived by partial melting of thickened lower crust ( e . g .
Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004 , especially in the Jurassic ( Fig . 1a ) ( e . g .
The starting point of Curve 1 represents the composition of a pure slab melt , which is supposed by Stern & Killian ( 1996 ) .
It is generally accepted that East China has been part of the Eurasian continental plate since North China and South China were joined in the Triassic ( e . g .
Therefore , the most probable scenario that can explain the elevated MgO , Mg - number , Cr , Ni , Yb and Th contents , but low Al 2 O 3 and FeO T / MgO , of the Dexing adakitic porphyries is partial melting of lower crust during delamination , similar to the model proposed for the Late Jurassic - Cretaceous Ningzhen , Yueshan and Tongshankou adakitic intrusive rocks in the eastern Yangtze Block ( Xu et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b .
As mentioned above , the most probable petrogenetic model for generating the Dexing adakitic magmas is partial melting of delaminated lower crust during the late Mesozoic .
As there is little geodynamic evidence for the existence of contemporaneous subduction , combined with the observation that the Dexing adakitic porphyries have much lower e Nd ( t ) Â¼ 171 Ma ) than those of 400 - 179 Ma MORB ( representing appropriate subducted oceanic crustal protoliths ) and Cenozoic adakites ( Fig . 7 ) , and higher Th contents and Th / Ce ratios than subducted slab - derived adakites ( Fig . 5i and j ) , we conclude that the Dexing adakitic porphyries were unlikely to have been produced by partial melting of subducted oceanic crust in the Middle Jurassic .
In addition to f O 2 , we suggest that another important factor that controls Cu - Au mineralization is the source of the chalcophile elements .

Several genetic models have been proposed to account for the origin of adakites and adakitic rocks .
This implies that the continental crust in the Dexing area has undergone some thinning since the Mesozoic .

Chen , 1999 ; Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004 , the increase in pressure and temperature might have converted mafic rocks in the lower crust into amphibole - bearing eclogites .

Porphyry ore deposits are the source of much of the copper , molybdenum , gold and silver used by humans .
Porphyry ore typically forms in magmatic arcs above subduction zones .
Porphyry deposits form at several kilometres depth in the crust and are associated with pipe - or dyke - like magmatic intrusions [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] ( see Supplementary Information ) .
Deposits often occur in clusters and formed within specific time intervals .
Porphyry deposits typically form in oceanic or continental arcs above subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) .
Fluids are released into the overlying mantle wedge causing it to melt ( Fig . 1 ) .

Early exsolution of carbonic fluids may have important implications for metal availability in the later stages of porphyry formation .

High magmatic sulphur solubilities would seem to be a prerequisite for the formation of giant porphyry and related epithermal deposits because these are , first and foremost , sulphur anomalies .
Abundant sulphur is required for the voluminous deposition of the sulphide ore minerals themselves and it can also play a role in complexing with copper and gold to enable hydrothermal transport 51 , 85 .

Melt reduction ( Fig .

Osmium isotope data from the Grasberg copper - gold porphyry were interpreted in terms of sourcing of gold from the black shale country rocks by hydrothermal leaching 96 .
Carbon - or reduced iron - rich rocks requires the existence of stable flow systems over hundreds of thousands to millions of years , for which there is rarely good evidence .
Host rocks may play a role in enhancing ore grade , with impermeable limestones ( for example , Grasberg ) possibly preventing the escape of fluids that may result in dispersion of metals in other systems and also providing a host for high - grade skarns .
The expansion and cooling of fluids through the steep temperature gradients that will be developed across the top of a porphyry intrusion has been proposed as an effective mechanism for the deposition of ore minerals in a quasistatic position 65 .
The volatile content of the melt and tectonic activity may be important in this respect , as both play a role in driving rock failure .
Cannibalization of sulphide - rich domains should be traceable using a range of geochemical proxies that would be observed only in systems that are fertile .

A change in plate motions could eventually release the compressional forces and allow fertile magmas to rise .
In buoyant magmas , these parameters are controlled largely by ascent through the crust .
The most copper - rich examples include the 4 - to 5 - millionyear - old El Teniente and Rio Blanco - Los Bronces deposits in central Chile , and the most gold - rich is the 3 - million - year - old Grasberg deposit in Irian Jaya , Papua New Guinea 17 .

The magmas produced migrate up into the crust above and crystallize to form plutons or erupt at the surface to form volcanic rocks 18 .
The magmas that crystallize to generate porphyry ore bodies have their origins in the sub - arc mantle ( Fig . 1 ) .
The chemical and physical properties of these hydrosilicate fluids are controlled by the polymerization of solutes into melt - like species and they provide an alternative mechanism for the transfer of components from the subducting slab to the mantle 32 .

The minerals present in the mantle source comprise silicates ( 98 % ) , spinel ( 2 % ) , sulphides ( 0 . 07 % ) and possibly metal alloys ( < 0 . 05 % ) 26 and it is likely that the behaviour of copper , silver , gold and other chalcophile or siderophile metals will be controlled by sulphides .

The extraction of metals from the melt into a separating volatile phase is a key stage in the evolution of mineralized porphyry systems 62 .
The crystallization of magnetite can reduce magmas by sequestering oxidized iron .
For porphyry deposits , only two of the triggers discussed can lead to exceptional metal endowment on the scale required to form the largest porphyry belts .
Such deposits represent a highly efficient trap where fluids were focused into a limited volume of rock , became supersaturated and precipitated ore minerals .
Such fluids could help to defertilize a melt by stripping it of metals .

These intrusions and associated ore - forming fluids are thought to be released from an underlying magma chamber .
These fluids then migrate upwards and outwards , cooling and possibly mixing with circulating ground waters , resulting in the precipitation of metal sulphides .

These alteration zones are important for exploration because they are typically spatially associated with porphyry systems and may host epithermal ores .
Other gold - enriched porphyry deposits , such as Bingham Canyon in Utah , were also emplaced into relatively reduced sedimentary sequences .
As the oceanic plate and overlying sediment subduct , increasing pressures expel water from the sediment , and hydrous minerals in the oceanic plate start to break down .
If the sulphide is later remelted by mafic intrusions ( green ) or dissolved by exsolving volatiles then a highly enriched melt or volatile phase will be generated .

If the source magma contained around 5 wt % fluid by mass , only ~ 50 km 3 of magma in the crustal chamber - equivalent to a sphere of radius ~ 2 . 3 kmwould be needed to provide the requisite metal - rich fluid for a giant ( 10 Mt of Cu metal ) ore body .

Although molybdenum is generally considered to have a crustal origin 47 , derivation from lithospheric mantle ( Fig . 1 ) with a long history of preenrichment has also been proposed 48 .
Although sulphide saturation could be viewed as destroying ore potential , the concentration of ore metals by saturation of a sulphide melt may be a highly effective mechanism for converting a magmatic system with a dispersed , low concentration of metals into one with pockets of highly enriched sulphide melt .

Although melt reduction is a viable mechanism for enhancing metal partitioning into hydrothermal fluids , in particular for gold , assimilation and reduction at depth could have the alternative effect of triggering sulphide saturation 87 ( Box 2 ) .
Stewing up magmas in the deep crust
The likely presence of CO 2 in the melt 50 would increase the depth of the onset of degassing , with the earliest fluids released being the most CO 2 - and possibly also SO 2 - rich , with an evolution towards H 2 O - rich compositions on ascent .

One of the distinctive characteristics of magmas that are temporally and spatially associated with large porphyry ore deposits is that they are enriched in a specific suite of elements , in particular displaying an unusually high strontium / yttrium ratio .

To form an economically exploitable porphyry ore body , fluids must be channelled through a relatively small volume of rock and the precipitation of metal sulphides must be very efficient within this volume ( Box 4 ) .
Unlike the mafic magmas hosting nickel - copper - platinum sulphide deposits , the water - rich nature of arc magmas makes this later volatile - driven extraction process potentially viable .
Thus , in a melt saturated with a volatile phase , reduction in the oxygen activity and the increased formation of reduced sulphur species in the MVP would be likely to result in effective gold and copper extraction .
However , if large faults focus the flow of these fluids to shallower crustal levels , they could play a role in the transfer of metals to form pre - ore enrichments in rocks subsequently intruded by porphyry systems , or to form mesothermal or epithermal gold deposits .
In contrast , melting of the slab sediment and the basaltic crust itself may be increasingly important at greater depths , expressed at the surface behind the volcanic front 29 , 30 .
Furthermore , the earliest pulses of magma in any one cycle are typically the most strongly mineralized 13 , contrary to the proposal of the model .

An additional sulphide precipitation mechanism , particularly in the later stages of hydrothermal evolution , is related to the neutralization of acidity in increasingly dissociated , cooling magmatic fluids by reaction with feldspars to form fine - grained white mica , illite and clays 69 .

To explain the oxidized nature of arc magmas , transfer from the subducting slab to the mantle of oxidizing components such as H 2 O , CO 2 and possibly ferric iron 36 has been proposed .
The attempt to subduct such features would temporarily put the arc into compression , closing faults that could provide escape pathways , thereby trapping magmas for unusually long periods in the deep crust .

Episodically , magma can escape from apophyses on the top of the magma chamber to form cylindrical intrusions and dyke swarms that rise to depths of 1 - 4 km .
As long as the sulphide melt , or its crystallized products , are accessible to - and soluble in - fluids that are subsequently exsolved from the magma 72 , 76 , 88 , then the potential exists to produce anomalously metal - rich hydrothermal fluids 47 .

In the case of porphyry systems , numerical models and detailed geochronology suggest that an individual hydrothermal system linked to an intrusion is likely to be active for no more than 50 - 100 kyr 58 , 70 .
The most common metalliferous ore deposits hydrothermal , formed from hot water circulating in the Earth ' s crust .
In theory , the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits does not require unusual fluid compositions 1 , 2 , as long as fluid focusing , sufficient fluid flux and efficient precipitation conditions can be maintained .
45 ) , it would saturate at about 14 km depth in the crust .
At this point , bubbles of aqueous fluid would begin to exsolve and , owing to their low density , would start to percolate towards the upper parts of the melt body .

This is because covalently bonded sulphur complexes of soft metals such as copper or gold may be unusually stable in a weakly ionized H 2 O - CO 2 solvent 51 .

In these zones , melting and assimilation of lower crustal rocks and differentiation of the magmas by fractional crystallization ( Fig . B1 ) produce more silica - rich compositions [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] .
Assuming that an andesitic melt derived from a deep crustal hot zone initially contains ~ 10 wt % H 2 O ( ref .
The problem with high sulphide concentrations in the melt is that this may trigger sulphide saturation , resulting in crystallization of sulphide minerals or , at higher temperatures , production of an immiscible sulphide melt .
The problem with porphyry systems is that this will result in depletion of the remaining silicate melt , so a later remobilization process is necessary ( for example , ref .
For example , the degassing of copper - rich fluids from a deep magma chamber ( > 15 km ) was recently suggested based on a study of the Pleistocene Pilavo volcano in Ecuador 52 .
To understand the rarity of large ore deposits , it is argued that the key step is the process by which the predisposition is developed , in the fluid / metal source region .
By contrast , the metal content of fluids can vary by four to five orders of magnitude ( for example , refs 73 , 89 - 91 ) .
By contrast , the metal content of fluids vary by four to five orders of magnitude ( for example , refs 73 , 89 - 91 ) .
Thus , although a trap mechanism is undoubtedly required , the processes ore metal budget of fluids exsolving from the melt ( Boxes 2 and 3 ) are arguably more important in governing the total mass of ore metal and the metal tenor of sulphides ultimately precipitated .
Direct evidence of fluids of this kind in nature is provided by unusual silica - and volatile - rich inclusions in diamond 33 and mantle xenoliths 34 , 35 .
Fractures above the intrusions allow hydrous fluids to separate and escape from the magma 14 , 19 , 24 , and depressurization causes them to undergo phase separation into coexisting hypersaline brine and vapour .
The search for such deposits often requires companies to use costly techniques to probe beneath up to a kilometre of barren rock .
Explanation of this non - uniform pattern could be key to understanding how and why metals accumulate in some places and not in others , and is therefore fundamental for mineral exploration .
The nature of these fluids and how they may vary with depth is still a matter of debate 28 .
I suggest that some magma chambers , or parts of these chambers , are predisposed to form ore , which can explain the occurrence of large porphyry deposits .
Our understanding of metal extraction and transport processes therefore seems incomplete .
In either case , the strong affinity for the sulphide phase of siderophile metals such as iron and gold and , to a lesser extent , copper , will cause them to be stripped very effectively from the silicate melt ( for example , refs 56 , 72 , 76 , 87 ) , as long as sufficient interaction between sulphide and silicate melt ( such as by convection ) occurs .
The recognition that porphyry ore fluids commonly contain up to 1 wt % copper ( and possibly several times more than this in some cases ) means that the mass of fluid required to form giant deposits is actually rather modest .
The process by which cannibalization occurs may be related to injections of more primitive , mafic melts into the crustal chamber ; the presence of such magmas has been noted in many porphyry systems but their role in ore formation has remained enigmatic .

The lifespan of these chambers , in which magmas fractionate and crystallize to form granitic plutons , is probably from 100 kyr to more than 5 Myr based on dating of plutonic phases [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and the age range of associated overlying porphyry and / or volcanic systems [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] .
However , generation of the largest deposits is often restricted to specific arc segments and limited periods of time .
In order to concentrate metals during partial melting they must preferentially partition into this melt .
The apparently constant redox state of the Manus Basin magmas , also observed in other volcanic suites 94 , can be explained by buffering between the melt and the exsolving fluid , with the escape of reduced volatile species ( such as HS â ) countering the effect of Fe 3 + depletion by magnetite formation .
This could either be by derivation of fluids ( or melts ) from a pre - enriched source ( the source rock paradigm , for example , ref .
Explaining the rarity of large deposits is a challenging scientific problem .

Furthermore , some of the near - surface intense alteration of rocks that occurs when acidic magmatic volatiles dissolve in ground waters could have formed from fluids released early from rising magmas .
This potentially generates fertile magmas that can eventually migrate to shallower crustal levels and generate ore deposits .
It is at these depths that porphyryrelated mineralization develops ( see Supplementary Information ) .
Other mobile species are the large ion lithophile ( for example , strontium , lead ) and high - field - strength elements ( uranium , thorium ) 32 , components derived from subducted sediment ( boron and beryllium ) 29 , 30 , sulphate 37 and possibly chlorine 38 .

Ultimately , separation of a magmatic volatile phase ( MVP ) enriched in H 2 O , CO 2 , HCl , H 2 S , SO 2 and other volatile components is a key step in the transfer of metals from arc magmas into the highly mobile and buoyant hydrothermal fluids from which porphyry and related epithermal ore bodies form 19 , 23 .

An alternative mechanism for melt reduction is the assimilation of reduced rocks ( for example , organic - rich shales or limestones , or reduced iron - rich igneous rocks ) by the intruding magma 95 .
Trigger 3 ( Box 3 ) involves processes operating on scales between that of the crustal staging chamber and the deposit itself .
Although unusually efficient extraction of metals into the hydrothermal fluid may play a role in governing ore - forming potential , the requirement of specific geology means that it is unlikely to represent a universal control of fertility .
Triggers for the formation of porphyry ore deposits in magmatic arcs
It is generally believed that copper and gold are derived from the mantle .
The conventional view is that hydrothermal ore deposits are zones of highly efficient precipitation from unexceptional fluids .
It is in this environment that sulphide saturation could occur ( Box 2 ) leading to the production of metal - enriched regions in the chamber that could later be cannibalized by exsolving aqueous fluids ( Fig . B2 ) .
The alternative argument , that large deposits are rare because they require the random coincidence of numerous , coincident , not - atypical factors 26 , 71 - the ' perfect storm ' of ore formation - is hard to disprove , but does not satisfactorily explain the clustering of deposits in certain belts and at certain periods of The precipitation trigger is commonly regarded as the key process in the formation of an economic concentration of ore minerals and so much study has been devoted to the investigation of ore deposits with the identification of such a control being a central aim .
46 ) ; or by unusually efficient extraction from an un - enriched source 4 .
Consequently , the fingerprint of sulphide saturation in igneous rocks could be used to identify those parts of magmatic arcs that are particularly predisposed to ore formation .

At present , there seems to be no systematic correlation between more - reduced porphyry melts and deposit metal endowment , although an association with gold enrichment does seem to exist for the allied family of reduced , pluton - related gold deposits 80 .

Nonetheless , the ubiquity of the depositional processes would seem to make precipitation efficiency an unlikely key trigger for the formation of rare , large deposits .
Conventionally it is believed that dehydration of the slab is a principal mechanism for the transfer of water - soluble components into the wedge in the shallower parts of the subduction zone .
This is particularly likely if the melt becomes reduced , which can occur owing to the onset of magnetite crystallization 86 .
This is particularly likely if the melt reduced , which can occur owing to the onset of magnetite crystallization 86 .
The final step in the formation of porphyry ore deposits involves the escape of magmatic - hydrothermal fluids upwards and / or outwards from the lithostatically pressured magmatic source 24 , primarily through fractures , where they undergo cooling and depressurization , and react with surrounding wall rocks ( Fig . B4 ) .
This typically From experiments on basaltic melts containing geologically reasonable levels of chlorine and sulphur , it was concluded that there was a clear relationship between gold solubility in the melt and its oxidation state 92 .
However , the relationships between sulphur solubility and metal enrichment processes are complex and poorly understood .
However , it is more plausible that assimilation of these rocks both provided gold to the porphyry magma and resulted in melt reduction and enhanced gold partitioning into the MVP .

It is clearly necessary for all the ingredients of ore formation to be in place , yet the existence of a dominant , overriding trigger process that switches on or off ore - forming predisposition is a simpler explanation for deposit clustering and is supported by emerging melt and fluid compositional data 10 , 72 , 73 .

If this process occurs at depth then magmas ascending to shallower levels may be strongly depleted in ore metals 37 and therefore would be defertilized and unlikely to form economic deposits .
In conclusion , it seems likely that sulphide saturation is a key step that heterogenizes melts in the mid to shallow crust and thereby produces regions on the scale of tens to hundreds of kilometres that are both enriched and depleted in ore metals .

Numerical modelling suggests that the dynamic evolution of permeability in the fracture network that develops above a porphyry intrusion is probably an important control on the localization of the precipitation front 68 .
This synthesis helps to constrain the heterogeneous distribution of porphyry and their associated epithermal ore deposits in time and space .
This synthesis helps to constrain the heterogeneous distribution epithermal ore deposits in time and space .
This longevity is not possible without thermal rejuvenation , implying that the chambers grow by the input of numerous batches of andesitic and / or more mafic magma from the deep crustal melt reservoir 59 .
The first process is characterized by a cyclical enrichment of magmas with metals and water in the deep crust .
Somewhere along the way , some of these magmas are transformed and become capable of generating porphyry ore deposits .
Somewhere along the way , some of these magmas transformed and become capable of generating porphyry ore deposits .
It is not thought to be likely that the downgoing slab contributes significant quantities of copper or gold 39 .
This process was invoked to account for abrupt decreases in copper and gold with progressive fractionation in lavas from the Manus Basin , offshore Papua New Guinea 93 , although the link between magnetite crystallization and metal depletion could also be owing to the triggering of sulphide saturation in the melt 86 .
Another way of considering this is that precipitation efficiency perhaps varies by only one order of magnitude in mineralizing hydrothermal systems and , in the few cases where it has been documented , is > 85 % ( refs 98 , 99 ) .
I argue that one process in particular - sulphide saturation in silicate magmas - leads to a critical pre - enrichment in metals , without which large porphyry deposits cannot form .
Finally , localized processes trigger the precipitation of ore minerals in the crust .
Trigger 2 ( Box 2 ) is a highly effective process for scavenging and enriching a system in metals and sulphur at the same time ; indeed this process is known to be the fundamental trigger for the formation of magmatic nickel - copper - platinum deposits in mafic igneous rocks .
If predispositions of specific regions in a magmatic arc to form large porphyry deposits can be identified , we can significantly narrow down the search for belts within the Earth that are likely to have experienced a high degree of mineralization .

Trigger 1 ( Box 1 ) can potentially generate fertile melts that then exsolve fertile ore fluids , predisposed to form large and / or high - grade ore deposits when they encounter the suitable trap conditions that may be intrinsic to most porphyry systems .
The third process is an efficient transfer of metals into hydrothermal fluids that are exsolved from the magmas .
In theory , it should be possible to identify geochemical tracers of the process or processes that have enriched a certain arc segment in the ore - forming ingredients : metals , sulphur and water .
It has been postulated that around 25 % partial melting of ' normal ' mantle would be required to extract all the sulphides present 40 , although less ( ~ 6 % ) melting may be required if the mantle has been oxidized by subduction zone fluids 41 .

However , a recent study has suggested that the source region for typical arc magmas is neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest such as copper 42 .

Many experimental studies have investigated the partitioning behaviour of metals 49 and sulphur 63 between melt and MVP but the number of competing variables makes it difficult to establish the most important factors .

Melting also occurs at lower temperatures if the mantle oxidized and hydrated by volatile species derived from the downgoing slab ; this is potentially one of the reasons why subduction - related arc magmatism favours the formation of ore deposits in contrast to other parts of the Earth .
This focuses attention on the processes by which metals are enriched in hydrothermal fluids and , in the case of porphyry systems , in their precursor magmas .

Consequently , it is considered more likely that melt fertilization , if it occurs , takes place in the mid to shallow crustal magma chambers .
It should be noted , however , that the roles of fluid flux and focusing as controls of deposit size are relatively poorly constrained .
Notwithstanding this argument , the importance of total fluid flux and degree of fluid focusing in the genesis of large porphyry deposits remain relatively poorly constrained .
The link between this process and the propensity of magmas to go on to form ore deposits is uncertain 52 , but cyclic replenishment of long - lived , deep crustal chambers by mantle - derived basalts has been suggested as a mechanism for ramping up the content of volatiles and metals during amphibole fractionation 81 , 82 .

However , this mechanism does not easily explain the barren or low - grade intrusions that are commonly observed in fertile systems , predicting instead an evolution from lower to higher fertility through time .
A number of previous workers have proposed that such mafic intrusions could themselves add sulphur and metals during such a process 61 , [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] .
By developing the tools to identify the signature of fertilization , predictive capacity can be improved .
Many systems that seem to have very similar geology to ore deposits produce altered rocks that are only weakly mineralized or barren .
Many systems that seem to have very similar geology to ore deposits produce altered rocks weakly mineralized or barren .
Here , I highlight four key stages in the formation of porphyry deposits .
One key piece of evidence is the link between times when subduction was slowed by the presence of buoyant , topographic features such as ocean ridges on the downgoing plate ( Fig . 1 ) and the subsequent formation of large ore deposits 17 .
It is possible that these escape events are triggered by hotter mafic intrusions into the chamber ( for example , ref .
Although part of this variability may reflect analysis of fluids part way through the precipitation process , data from apparently primary ( premineralization ) fluids from economic porphyry deposits showed one to three orders higher copper concentrations than comparable fluids from barren intrusions 10 .

This is particularly pertinent given present concerns over mineral resource supply and the potential conflicts between the need to secure the resources required for socioeconomic and clean technology development , and the impacts of resource extraction on the Earth ' s environment and climate .
A clearer understanding of what controls the localization of ore deposits is therefore a prerequisite for more efficient and environmentally friendly exploration .
This interaction is thought to occur primarily in so - called hot zones in the lower crust of the overriding plate ( Fig . 1 ) where underplating and / or intrusion of the basaltic melts takes place .

Trigger 4 ( Box 4 ) , as previously argued , may be innate to intrusion - centred hydrothermal systems and so does not distinguish between fertile and barren systems ; it does not matter how efficient precipitation processes are if the fluids low concentrations of metals and / or sulphur .
Consequently there is , as yet , little evidence to suggest that selective metal enrichment to form fertile porphyry magmas occurs in the mantle .
This process may also be expected to deplete more strongly those metals with a greater affinity for the sulphides ( for example , gold relative to copper , silver , zinc and lead ) .
The efficiency of this process could make the difference between systems that generate highly metalliferous ore fluids and ultimately form large ore deposits and those that just produce weak mineralization ( Box 3 ) .

This is supported by two key observations : ( 1 ) measurements of metal contents in fluid inclusions believed to represent the earliest fluids exsolved from a number of mineralized and barren porphyry intrusions show that mineralized intrusions are characterized by more metal - rich fluids 10 ; and ( 2 ) metal ratios in porphyry ore bodies match primary fluid compositions , implying quantitative metal precipitation ( even if metals are partly separated into different zones ) , suggesting that the dissolved metal budget directly controls the metal tenor of the sulphide mineralization formed 72 , 89 .

However , this view poses an interesting mass - balance conundrum for oredeposit modellers because low metal concentrations large fluid fluxes for the formation of giant deposits .
This timescale is significantly shorter than that which relates to the subduction processes previously discussed and no consistent links have been established between changing tectonic stress and the emplacement of barren or mineralized intrusions .
Evidence for the operation of this process has been described from the active Merapi volcano in Indonesia where it was inferred that the injection of sulphide - saturated mafic magma into a felsic chamber triggered volatile exsolution , dissolution of sulphide into the volatile phase and caused explosive eruptions 75 .
Although some or all of these processes must act in concert to generate large ore deposits , I argue that sulphide saturation of the magma is the most important step and that this can explain the temporal and spatial distribution of ores .
I explore the gaps in our understanding by considering the formation of porphyry ore deposits [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] .
This can lead to complex evolution pathways , reflected in the variety of volcanic rocks observed at the surface .
I further suggest that this process can account for the heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal distribution of these ores .

Although there is a convergence of opinion on the main processes that result in mineralization , it is unclear what makes some systems fertile , that is , capable of generating large ore deposits 25 , 26 .
This picture has been complicated by the recognition from experimental studies that a continuum exists between silicate melts and aqueous liquids under subduction zone conditions 31 .
Here , I outline a hierarchy of four key triggers that may be involved in the formation of large porphyry deposits .
This chemistry has several proposed origins , but one model is that it is a fingerprint of the crystallization of hornblende Â± garnet from water - rich magmas in the deep or mid crust 52 , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] .
If such an event should coincide There is an increasing awareness of the potential importance of magmatic sulphur in controlling metal enrichment or depletion in porphyry systems and consequently their fertility 84 .

This seems to point towards a shallower switch , active on a shorter timescale , which could control porphyry ore formation .
Despite the feasibility of this mechanism , it is important to note that these conditions may be met in any cooling magmatichydrothermal system in which sufficient permeability is developed to allow significant fluxing of fluids from the magma into the overlying fractured rock column .
Their discovery consumes considerable time and resources and only about one in every thousand prospects explored by companies is eventually developed into a mine .

The low Mn concentration in most of the apatites from Kiruna - type deposits may be due to the associated mineral assemblage .
The magnetite may have sequestered large amounts of Mn and the prominent negative Eu anoma - lies in the apatites may be caused by the presence of albite and K - feldspar , which incorporate Eu more readily than other REEs , leading to negative Eu anomalies in the coexisting phases ( Leeman and Phelps , 1981 ; Bea et al . , 1994 ) .
The apatites from the Seabee and Dentonia mines have the lowest ( La / Sm ) CN values ( < 0 . 4 ; Fig . 9d ) , possibly due to the pres - ence of monazite and allanite , which incorporate the LREE over the MREE ( Mahood and Hildreth , 1983 ; Michael , 1988 ) .

The REE are highly incompatible with micas ( Adam and Green , 2006 ) ; thus , the coeval apatites would readily accommodate any REE released by feldspar breakdown .

The Con - gress ( Lou ) deposit is hosted in mafic volcanic rocks and the Au - bearing veins consist mainly of stibnite , arsenopyrite , and other sulfide minerals ( Harrop and Sinclair , 1986 ; Schroeter , 1987 ; Leitch et al . , 1989 ) .

The porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit types are also robustly discriminated because a relatively large number of samples from numerous individual deposits were examined , albeit all from British Columbia .

Note that Durango apatite ( Cerro de Mercado ) was used to calibrate the approach , but due to the paucity of apatite analyses in the literature , we still used the median value based on this apatite .
The main trace element characteristics of apatites from differ - ent deposit types are as follows : 1 .
Unlike the apatites from other unmineralized groups , the apatites from MOR ( the unmineralized group ) have Ca and trace element content levels similar to the apatites from min - eralized groups , most likely because the parental MOR melts are depleted in trace elements .
Similar to Eu in whole - rock carbonatite data , apatites from carbonatites also show no Eu anomalies , consistent with little or no fractionation of feldspar from these magmas ( Cullers and Medaris , 1977 ; Bell , 1989 ; Belousova et al . , 2002 ; Ani and SarapÃ¤Ã¤ , 2009 ) .
Likewise , apatites from the Wernecke IOCG breccias are part of a hydrothermal alteration assemblage that includes albite , K - feldspar , and magnetite ( Brookes et al . , 2001 ; Hunt et al . , 2011 ) .
Thus , the trace element compositions of detrital apatite in sedimentary overburden ( e . g . , stream sediments , tills , etc . )
Additional apatites from different orogenic Ni - Cu deposits are required to confirm these trace element characteristics .
Thus , the high V and S contents , coupled with the variation in Ce / Ce * in apa - tites from alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits , probably reflect oxidizing conditions prevailing during both magma evolution and deposit formation .

Thus , the high S contents , coupled with the variation in Ce / Ce * in apa - tites from alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits , probably reflect oxidizing conditions prevailing during both magma evolution and deposit formation .
Subsequent calcic altera - tion associated with the Au - Cu - Ag mineralization may have exchanged Ca2 + for impurity cations in these apatites .
The typical mineral assemblage for Kiruna - type deposits is magnetite Â± actinolite Â± apatite with apatite serving as the main repository for the REEs .
The strong negative Eu anomalies probably reflect crystallization of K - feldspar during early - stage potassic alteration .
By using 11 elements ( Mn , Sr , Y , La , Ce , Eu , Dy , Yb , Pb , Th , and U ) , the discriminant - function scores for each sample are obtained as follows : DP1 - 1 = â0 . 06461âlog ( Mn ) â 1 . 56âlog ( Sr ) + 2 . 609âlog ( Y ) + 0 . 3631âlog ( La ) â 1 . 766âlog ( Ce ) + 0 . 6243âlog ( Eu ) â 3 . 642âlog ( Dy ) + 0 . 7086âlog ( Yb ) â 1 . 178âlog ( Pb ) + 0 . 4161âlog ( Th ) + 0 . 963âlog ( U ) + 6 . 589 .
Most of the apatites from the orogenic Au and orogenic Ni - Cu deposits can be separated from other deposit types ( Fig . 8 ) .
The unusual geochemistry of some apatites from the Wernecke breccia compared with that of Kiruna - type deposits in our study may reflect a different origin for this deposit , as proposed by Hunt et al . ( 2011 ) .
Although the apatites from different orogenic Au depos - its display variable trace element behavior ( Fig . 9 ) , they are effectively discriminated by the DPA functions ( Fig . 8c ) .

Presently , carbon - atites are the most robustly discriminated deposit type in our study because apatites come from many complexes world - wide .

Discrimination of porphyries and skarns ( step IIIa , DP3 ) Discrimination diagrams for this step were constructed using apatite compositions from various porphyry and skarn depos - its that were subdivided from the other deposit types in the previous step .
Discrimination of IOCG and Kiruna - type deposits ( step IIIb , DP4 ) The discrimination diagrams for this step were constructed using apatite data from the Wernecke IOCG breccia and Kiruna - type deposits .

Consequently , an ore - forming fluid passing through ( meta ) sedimentary rocks may liberate As and make it avail - able for incorporation into later forming minerals such as apa - tite .
Within different ore deposits , apatites from orogenic Au , orogenic Ni - Cu Â± PGE , and undivided Kiruna - type and IOCG depos - its stand out from other types of deposits in step II ( Fig . 8 ) , and the apatites determined to have iron oxide - associated affinity at this step are further subdivided into Kiruna - type and IOCG breccia - type deposits in step IIIb ( Fig . 12 ) .
Importantly , the low solubility of P2O5 in silicate melts ( Watson , 1980 ; Nash , 1984 ) commonly results in early apatite crystallization that may continue until late - stage fluid saturation and accompanying metallic mineralization .

For example , the apatites from car - bonatites contain the highest Nb and lowest W contents in this study .

For most types of deposits , however , it is impossible to use one or two elements to differentiate one group from all others .
Discrimination of apatites from different deposits and unmineralized rocks ( step I , DP1 ) The purpose of the first discrimination step is to separate apatites from various mineralized systems , carbonatites , and related rocks , and rocks not associated with known miner - alization .
Discrimination of general deposit types ( step II , DP2 ) The objective of the second step is to differentiate the min - eralized apatites into the main deposit types : porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , epithermal Au - Ag , IOCG , skarn , orogenic Au , and orogenic Ni - Cu ore systems .

In contrast to the Kirkland Lake Au deposits , which are mid - crustal mesozonal orogenic systems ( Rowins et al . , 1991 ; Robert , 2001 ; Ispolatov et al . , 2008 ) , geological features of the Congress ( Lou ) orogenic Au deposit suggest formation at shallower epizonal depths ( e . g . , Groves et al . , 1998 ) .
Also shown is the median apatite from Kiruna - type IOCG deposits ( Belousova et al . , 2002 ) that was not used in DPA for construction of the discrimina - tion diagrams .
The variability of As abundances in apatite suggests that elevated As is probably a good local indicator of Au and / or Cu mineralization , but is not specific to a deposit type .

Some data from the Abitibi syenites partly overlap with carbonatites , reflecting a close temporal and spatial association of some of these plu - tons with carbonatites .
In the case of the Congress deposit , the high Mg contents of hydrothermal apatites may reflect the mafic protolith .
This study evaluates apatite trace element compositions to do the following : ( 1 ) discriminate between apatites formed in association with mineral deposits from those formed in unmineralized rocks ; and ( 2 ) discriminate apatites from the different types of mineral deposits .
To perform the DPA , Mg , Mn , Sr , Y , Ce , Eu , Yb , Pb , Th , and U were used ( Table 5 ; App .
These trends of the Mn and Sr depletion in ore zones were attributed to the hydrothermal breakdown of plagioclase and ferromagnesian minerals to sericite , quartz , epidote , and chlorite ( e . g . , Olade and Fletcher , 1976 ; Ash and Riveros , 2001 ; Duuring et al . , 2009b ) .
Even for individual deposit types where apatites displayed significant variation in trace element contents , the linear discriminant functions derived from the multivariate data successfully minimized differences between the data within the same deposit group while enhancing the contrast between the groups .
The concentrations of V , Mn , Sr , Ce , Eu , Yb , Pb , and Th have been used in the DPA calcula - tion ( Table 5 , App .
The discrimination of apatites from the different deposits relies on the multivariate DPA approach because trace element contents of apatites show large variations owing to many controlling factors , including fluid / melt source variation , degree of fractionation , crystal - lization history , coexisting mineral assemblage , alteration types , and redox conditions .
Silicon , along with S and Na , is present as charge compensators .
However , most of the apatite data from MORs and the unmineralized diorites and granodiorites fall within the field of various ore deposits in the DP diagram ( Fig . 7a ) .

Table 1 ) suggest that apatites sam - pled in the alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits are both mag - matic and hydrothermal in origin because all of these rocks experienced some late - stage hydrothermal alteration ( e . g . , Richards , 1990 ) .
The abundances of these chemical impurities in apatite can be affected by many factors .
It should be noted that apatite from the Aktogai porphyry Cu - Mo deposit has a lower Mn content than apatite from five porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits in this study ( Table 2 ) .
It should be noted that apatite from the Aktogai porphyry Cu - Mo deposit has a lower Mn content than apatite from five porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits in this study ( Table 2 ) .
Further - more , because apatites from these deposits share many trace element characteristics ( Fig . 9 ) , they are discussed together .
Due to limited numbers of apatites from epithermal Au - Ag deposits ( 9 grains from 3 samples ) , this group is combined with porphyry deposits and will not be discriminated in the following steps .
Discriminant analysis using Mg , V , Mn , Sr , Y , La , Ce , Eu , Dy , Yb , Pb , Th , and U reveals that apatites from mineral deposits can be distinguished from apatites in carbonatites and unmineralized rocks .
Previous studies have used apatite as a petrogenetic indicator , an oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) proxy , and as an indicator for mineral exploration ( Sha and Chappell , 1999 ; Piccoli and Candela , 2002 ; Cao et al . , 2012 ; Miles et al . , 2014 ) .

It is note - worthy that the apatites from diorites and granodiorites have consistent negative Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 08â0 . 42â among the largest negative Eu anomalies observed in this study ) , and many of these apatites contain elevated Cl con - tents compared with other apatite groups ( Table 4 ) .

However , 11 grains from the Wernecke IOCG breccia show much higher Eu / Eu * , from 0 . 7 to 1 . 5 , and some of these grains and a few others from this deposit have high Mn contents ( up to 5 , 753 ppm ) .

This study demonstrates that detrital apatite grains collected during regional geochemical surveys are effective in identifying specific types of buried mineral deposits in glaciated terranes .
For example , exploration for porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits in the highly prospective Late Triassic - Early Jurassic Quesnel and Stikine magmatic arc terranes of south - central British Columbia is challenging due to extensive cover by glacial sediments ( Ward et al . , 2009 ) .
This is due to the relatively lower temperatures and pressures of crystallization , resulting in lower solubilities of many trace elements in most aqueous fluids compared to silicate melts .

Interestingly , however , the apatites from Congress ( Lou ) have Mg contents and ( La / Sm ) CN and ( Ce / Yb ) CN ratios , and Eu / Eu * values similar to those of the Kirkland Lake apatites ( Fig . 9a , d ) .
The separation between these apatite groups is better MAO ET AL .
This distinguishes them from apatites in the other deposit types .
Based on crystal chemistry , apa - tites formed from a Ca - rich but Sr - and REE - poor fluid at a relatively low temperature will tend to have low abundances of trace elements that include Sr .

They show the widest range of Ce / Ce * ( 0 . 9â1 . 7 ) of all apatite groups , consistent with high but variable redox conditions during their formation .
The abundance of some " trace " elements such as Sr and Mn can be up to 8 . 96 and 7 . 59 wt % , respectively , in natural apatite ( Rakovan and Hughes , 2000 ; Hughes et al . , 2004 ) .

Additional work targeting these rocks will help to refine and further test the novel approaches developed in this study .
Therefore , developing a robust trace element classification for apatite could provide a useful mineral exploration tool and an efficient way to discriminate between deposit types .

Only the published data from the Kiruna - type and por - phyry Cu - Mo deposits are projected into the discrimination diagrams for various deposit types ( steps II and III ) .
This study demonstrates that the trace element contents of natural apatites possess enough variability to accurately determine their igneous source rocks and / or the type of deposit from which they were derived .
This difference probably reflects apatite crystal - lization during greenschist facies fluid - rock reactions .
The Dento - nia samples also show a large positive Eu anomaly ( Eu / Eu * = 1 . 3â1 . 5 ) , which is atypical of apatites analyzed in this study .

The large variations in the size of negative Eu anomalies ( Fig . 9a ) may reflect early plagioclase fractionation or partial melting of source rocks that retained feldspar ( Watson and Green , 1981 ; Piccoli and Candela , 2002 ; Tollari et al . , 2008 ) .

Miles et al . ( 2014 ) observed that Mn 2 + substitutes into apatite more readily than Mn 3 + and concluded that redox conditions have more influence on the partitioning of Mn into apatite than does temperature .
An alternative hypothesis is that the apatites in mineralized rocks crystallized from hydro - thermal fluids that contained relatively low concentrations of the elements that partition onto the Ca sites .
The published apatite compositions for barren syenites and dolerite fall within the mineralized field , overlapping our data from MOR , in the DP1 - 1 vs . DP1 - 2 diagram ( Fig . 7a ) .
Despite this discrepancy , much of the apatite data from the Aktogai porphyry Cu - Mo deposit are still cor - rectly classified in these discrimination diagrams .

Strontium contents of apatites , unlike Mn con - tents , are more likely to mimic those of whole rocks due to the different site preferences for Sr and Mn in apatites ( Piccoli and Candela , 2002 ) .

Through the four discrimination steps , the apatites from many ore deposits can be readily separated from the other groups .

Discrimination diagrams are used to subdivide the apatites by origin and the results indicate that apatite is a robust indicator mineral for exploration .
They can be discriminated from other groups using Sr , Eu , and Yb ( Fig . 9b , c ) and their relatively high As ( 17â 419 ppm ) and W ( < 1â10 ppm ) contents ( Table 4 ) .
Future work should test this finding by analyzing apatites from world - class IOCG deposits such as Olympic Dam , Candelaria , CarajÃ¡s , Cloncurry , as well as other Kiruna - type deposits from Sweden and northern Chile .
The low contents of cation impurities , especially LREE , are similar to those of apatites from Wernecke IOCG breccia and porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia .
These coefficients are applied to logarithms of the concentration values , and all the DPA functions are calculated similarly to the equation ( 9 ) ( App .
Specifically , step I draws three distinct groups for apatites from carbonatites , ore deposits , and unmineralized rocks ( Fig . 7a ) .
Based on these observations , it is apparent that the trace element composition of apatite is sensitive to the environment in which it forms .
The calculated discriminant functions highlight distinct trace element differences between apatites from barren rocks and the different deposit types .
A recent model ( Hunt et al . , 2011 ) suggests that the Wernecke ore fluids were derived from formational waters via dewatering of the host sedimentary basin .
Below we discuss the three - step DPA results based on the apatite data from known deposits comprising our training dataset .
The geologic setting of the Cerro de Mercado and Great Bear deposits is consistent with this explanation ( e . g . , Mumin et al . , 2007 ; Rakovan , 2007 ; Acosta - GÃ³ngora et al . , 2014 ) .
In this study we analyzed the trace element compositions of apatite grains ( 922 analyses ) from most major types of mineral deposits by LA - ICPMS and constructed optimized discrimi - nation diagrams from DPA using the multi - element data set .
Exploration tools such as this are valuable in regions where bedrock exposure is limited .
However , where projected using the discriminant functions for porphyries and skarns ( DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 2 and DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 3 ; Table 5 ) , only about half of the data from the porphyry Cu - Mo deposit are classified cor - rectly as apatite from a porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au , with a few data points falling within the alkalic porphyry Cu - Au field and the rest of the data straddling the boundary between the porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au and the porphyry Mo fields ( Fig . 10 ) .
These findings are considered preliminary , however , because apatite data are restricted to one deposit .
These diagrams ( Fig . 12 ) , therefore , are 1216 ( a ) ( b ) Kiruna - type IOCG breccia Kiruna - type ( Belousova et al . , 2002 ) IOCG Kiruna - type Fig . 12 .
The number of samples for each group varies depending on selected ele - ments ( App .
Six discriminant functions from three different sets of DPA using Mn , Y , Ce , Eu , Dy , Yb , Th , and U ( Â± Mg Â± Sr Â± Pb ) were found to effectively discriminate these groups ( Fig . 8 ; Table 5 ) .
Con - sequently , primary clinopyroxene and biotite have relatively high Mg / Fe ratios due to the low Fe2 + / Fe3 + in the magma , which results in the substitution of Mg2 + for Fe2 + in primary ferromagnesian silicates .

For example , Sha and Chappell ( 1999 ) recognized that depletion in LREE and Th in apatite from S - type and felsic I - type granitoids was due to the occurrence of monazite , whereas its absence in mafic I - type granitoids produced an enrichment of these elements in apatite .

Studies of Cao et al . ( 2012 ) and Bouzari et al . ( 2011 ) on both magmatic and hydrothermal apatites from porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits suggested that trace elements in apatites could be used in exploration for these deposits .

The proposed discrimination diagrams do require further testing with apatite data from known deposits .
This difference may be due to different analytical methods , which were EMPA in Cao et al . ( 2012 ) and LA - ICPMS in this study .
Little research , however , has focused on possible correlations between trace elements in apatites and different types of mineral deposits .
The DPA and statistically defined linear boundaries between the training apatite groups constitute the basis of the proposed discrimination diagrams , which we further test using available apatite analyses from literature .
A plot of the discriminant function DP4 - 1 ( step IIIb ; Table 5 ) vs . log U content and a ternary Mg - V - Mn plot for separating IOCG and Kiruna - type deposits correctly classify the median Kiruna and Cerro de Mercado apatite compo - sition of Belousova et al . ( 2002 ) as a Kiruna - type ( Fig . 12 ) .
Discriminant functions DP1 - 1 vs . DP1 - 2 ( Fig . 7a ) separate most of the apatite data from carbonatites , various mineral - ized systems , and the unmineralized rocks .
To achieve these objectives , we have analyzed more than 600 apatite grains from porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits , epithermal Au - Ag veins , iron oxide Cu - Au ( IOCG ) breccia and related Kirunatype iron oxide - apatite ( IOA ) deposits , orogenic Au veins , polymetallic skarns , orogenic Ni - Cu deposits , and carbonatite REE Â± Nb Â± Ta deposits , as well as approximately 300 apatite grains from unmineralized rocks , including clinopyroxenites , gabbros , diorites , granodiorites , monzonites , and syenites .
A similar observation was reported by Bouzari et al . ( 2011 ) , who investigated apatites from altered and fresh zones from three porphyry deposits .

Bouzari et al . ( 2011 ) have undertaken preliminary studies of RIMs associated with porphyry Cu Â± Mo Â± Au deposits and proposed that apatite , rutile , titanite , and magnetite are potential porphyry indicator minerals .
The MD is conceptu - ally similar to univariate Z - score as a measure of distance of APATITE TRACE ELEMENT COMPOSITIONS : NEW TOOL FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION 1209 a sample point from center in terms of the number of stan - dard deviations from mean .
The first and the second dis - criminant functions from the DP2 set 3 also best separate the orogenic Au from porphyry and from Au - Co skarn ( Fig . 8c ) .
Discriminant analysis In order to determine the optimum criteria for discriminat - ing between barren rocks and various deposits using apatite trace element compositions , we have undertaken a Discrimi - nant Projection Analysis ( DPA ) in ioGASÂ® software .
To maximize the number of multivariate samples , DPA calculations used combinations of up to 11 elements .
Variables are log10 - equivalents of element concentrations in ppm for all elements , except for Mg , which is in wt % .
Because all variables of the multivariate discriminant functions must be not nulls , we used only ele - ments that were analyzed in all apatite grains ( Mg , V , Mn , Sr , Y , La , Ce , Eu , Dy , Yb , Pb , Th , and U ) .
In general , the discrimination dia - grams successfully predicted known deposit - type affinities of apatites from previous studies .
Movie 1 ) illustrates the power of the DPA functions in discriminating between the different groups of apatite data , some of which appear to overlap in the 2 - D diagrams .
Moreover , scaled contributions from individual variables identify critical elements in discrim - inating apatites from different deposits , which may not be otherwise apparent from the multi - element data .
Sha and Chappell ( 1999 ) and Belousova et al . ( 2001Belousova et al . ( , 2002 have systemically investigated apatite in granitoids and suggested that these rock types could be identified based on the contents of specific trace elements ( e . g . , Mn , Fe , Sr , Y , and REE ) in apatite .
Finally , despite the large size of the dataset reported here ( n = 922 , not including analyses from Durango and Madagascar apatites ) , some apatite - bearing source rocks have either not been analyzed or have few analytical data .

For example , previous studies ( Watson and Green , 1981 ; Fleet and Pan , 1997 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) have shown that the mineral - melt partition coefficients of REE in apatite increases with increasing melt SiO2 content and decreases with increasing temperature .

The first two axes ( DP2 - 1 - 1 vs . DP2 - 1 - 2 and DP2 - 3 - 1 vs . DP2 - 3 - 2 ) from the DP2 sets 1 and 3 discriminate > 90 % of apatites from iron oxide - associated deposits ( IOCG breccia and Kiruna - type ) from the other groups ( Fig . 8a , c ) .

Consis - tent with the findings of Barton and Johnson ( 1996 ) and Oli - ver et al . ( 2004 ) , who proposed that brine is involved during the K / Na alteration stage of Kiruna - type deposits , our results show that apatites from the Aoshan Kiruna - type deposit contain between < 0 . 07 and 1 . 14 wt % Cl .
Therefore , we see no reason why the proposed discrimination approach should not work globally in addition to being a particularly useful exploration tool in glaciated terrains of the North American Cordillera .
In addition to the calculated discriminant functions , the key elements determined by the DPA can be used to construct simplified discrimination diagrams for some of the apatite groups .
The study focused on the Canadian Cordillera , where the complex geology has produced an extraordinarily diverse spectrum of ore deposit types making it an ideal natural laboratory in which to study apatites and their host rocks .
The correct identification of these published apatite data in step I , step II , and step IIIb indicates that the discrimi - nant diagrams / functions are capable of classifying unknown apatite grains according to their unmineralized / mineralized origins and primary deposit types .
Magnetite ( Fe3O4 ) is a well - recognized petrogenetic indicator and is a common accessory mineral in many ore deposits and their host rocks .
Magnetite belongs to the space group Fd3m and has an inverse spinel structure with the general stoichiometry AB 2 O 4 ( Bragg , 1915 , Fleet , 1981 , where A represents a divalent cation such as Mg , Fe 2 + , Ni , Mn , Co , or Zn , and B represents a trivalent cation such as Al , Fe 3 + , Cr , V , Mn , or Ga ( Lindsley , 1976a , Wechsler et al . , 1984 .
Titanium , with a 4 + charge , can also occupy the B site when substitution is coupled with a divalent cation ( Wechsler et al . , 1984 ) .
Octahedral sites in the magnetite structure are randomly occupied by subequal numbers of ferric ( Fe 3 + ) and ferrous ( Fe 2 + ) iron atoms , whereas tetrahedral sites are exclusively occupied by the smaller ferric iron atoms Fe 3 + [ Fe 2 + Fe 3 + ] O 4 ( Lindsley , 1976a , Waychunas , 1991 , Wechsler et al . , 1984 ( Fig . 1A ) .
Magnetite displays many phase transitions with other spinel group minerals , including but not limited to , spinel ( Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Waychunas , 1991 , White et al . , 1994 .
Cation substitution is generally more likely to take place at lower oxygen fugacity ( Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Frost , 1991a , Lindsley , 1991 .
Magnesium , Mn , Zn and Ni may substitute Fe 2 + , whereas Fe 3 + can be replaced by Al , V and Cr ( Fig . 1B , C ) ( e . g . , Barnes and Roeder , 2001 , Lindsley , 1991 , Ramdohr , 1955 , Righter et al . , 2006a .
Vanadium , which has a range of possible oxidation states depending on prevailing oxygen fugacity conditions , is mainly present as V 3 + in titanomagnetites but commonly shows variable minor amounts of V 4 + ( Balan et al . , 2006 , Bordage et al . , 2011 , Toplis and Carroll , 1995 .
Vanadium is incompatible at high oxygen fugacity levels due to its 5 + oxidation state .
Magnetite is one of the most abundant oxide minerals in the continental crust and has been recognized as an important indicator mineral for petrogenetic and geochemical studies since the early 20 th century ( Ramdohr , 1926 ) .
Magnetite is a widespread and easily identifiable accessory mineral in igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic host rocks of a wide range of compositions ( e . g . , Annersten , 1968 , Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Prins , 1972 , Ramdohr , 1955 , Rumble , 1976b , Shcheka et al . , 1980 , Vincent and Phillips , 1954 and can incorporate a large number of foreign cations ( Bowles et al . , 2011 , Lindsley , 1976a , Wechsler et al . , 1984 ( Fig . 1 ) .
Magnetite forms ideal pairs with silicates , carbonates , and other oxides such as hematite or ilmenite for geothermometry and geobarometry due to its distinct oxygen isotope fractionation factor ( e . g . , Buddington et al . , 1955 , Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Chacko et al . , 2001 , Friedman and O ' Neil , 1977 , Ghiorso and Sack , 1991a , Powell and Powell , 1977 , Sauerzapf et al . , 2008 , Zheng and Simon , 1991 .
Minor and trace elements that have been reported in magnetite ranges from alkali and alkaline earth metals to transition metals , including REE ' s , and metalloid and non - metals ( e . g . , Borisenko and Lapin , 1972 , Dare et al . , 2012 , Dupuis and Beaudoin , 2011 , Klemm et al . , 1985 , Lindsley , 1991 , McQueen and Cross , 1998 , Nadoll et al . , 2012 , Nielsen and Beard , 2000 , Righter et al . , 2006a , Singoyi et al . , 2006 .

Igneous magnetite from carbonatites has been investigated by a number of authors who found indicative minor and trace element signatures that can be attributed to controlling factors such as oxygen fugacity and interdependencies among substituting cations ( Bagdasarov , 1989 , Bailey and Kearns , 2002 , Reguir et al . , 2008 .

Magnetite in exploration and provenance studies
Magnetite , among other detrital heavy minerals such as ilmenite , rutile , garnet , and zircon has been a valuable asset to mineral exploration and provenance studies ( e . g . , Dupuis and Beaudoin , 2011 , Nadoll et al . , 2012 , Nadoll et al . , submitted , Razjigaeva and Naumova , 1992 , Shcheka et al . , 1982 .
Hydrothermal and igneous magnetite can provide vectors to mineralized areas where the primary mineralogical context is lost , deeply covered , or highly altered , similar to the use of rutile as a resistate indicator mineral ( Anand and Butt , 2010 , Borisenko and Lapin , 1972 , Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Hutton , 1950 , McQueen and Cross , 1998 , McQueen and Whitbread , 2002 , Rumble , 1976aand references therein , Shcheka et al . , 1982 , Triebold et al . , 2007 , Zack et al . , 2004 .

Multiple vein generations , large to small - scale overprints of multiple alteration stages , fluid / rock interaction , and secondary weathering processes translate into a variety of different types of hydrothermal magnetite .
Iron oxide copper - gold ( IOCG ) deposits have recently undergone intense study ( e . g .
Magnetite is an abundant mineral in many IOCG orebodies , and , although we present no data for magnetite from IOCG deposits , several studies have reported chemical trends in magnetite from these deposits .
Igneous and hydrothermal magnetites from porphyry deposits show a similar Ti / V ratio with over 90 % of the data plotting below 10 , and median ratios of 0 . 9 and 2 . 1 respectively .

Hydrothermal magnetite from BIF ( median 3 . 5 ) and Ag - Pb - Zn veins ( median 5 . 9 ) also show similar Ti / V ratios .
magnetite are the third highest in the dataset with a median value of 4 . 3 .
Crystallographic factors
Crystallographic factors such as ionic radius and the overall charge balance place further constraints on possible substituting cations ( Cornell and Schwertmann , 2003 , Fleet , 1981 , Goldschmidt , 1954 , Wechsler et al . , 1984 ( Fig . 1 ) .
