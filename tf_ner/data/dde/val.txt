The E - trending Gangdese porphyry copper belt in southern Tibet is a classic example of porphyry mineralization in a continental collision zone .
New zircon U - Pb geochronological , zircon Hf - O , and bulk - rock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene mineralizing intrusions from the Qulong , Zhunuo , Jiru , Chongjiang , and Lakange porphyry copper deposits and Eocene igneous rocks from the western Gangdese belt , together with literature data , show that both Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks and Miocene granitoids exhibit coupled along - arc isotopic variations , characterized by bulk - rock εNd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then decreasing toward ~ 95°E .
These are interpreted to reflect increasing contributions of subducted Indian continental materials from ~ 92° to ~ 84°E and from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E , respectively .
The Miocene mineralizing intrusions were derived from subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust represented isotopically by the Paleocene - Eocene intrusions , with contributions from Indian plate - released fluids and mafic melts derived from mantle metasomatized by subducted Indian continental materials .
Involvement of isotopically ancient Indian continental materials increased from east ( Qulong ) to west ( Zhunuo ) , which is interpreted to reflect an increasingly shallower angle of the downgoing Indian slab from east to west , consistent with geophysical imaging .
