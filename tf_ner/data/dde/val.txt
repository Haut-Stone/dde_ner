The E - trending Gangdese porphyry copper belt in southern Tibet is a classic example of porphyry mineralization in a continental collision zone .
New zircon U - Pb geochronological , zircon Hf - O , and bulk - rock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene mineralizing intrusions from the Qulong , Zhunuo , Jiru , Chongjiang , and Lakange porphyry copper deposits and Eocene igneous rocks from the western Gangdese belt , together with literature data , show that both Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks and Miocene granitoids exhibit coupled along - arc isotopic variations , characterized by bulk - rock εNd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then decreasing toward ~ 95°E .
These are interpreted to reflect increasing contributions of subducted Indian continental materials from ~ 92° to ~ 84°E and from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E , respectively .
The Miocene mineralizing intrusions were derived from subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust represented isotopically by the Paleocene - Eocene intrusions , with contributions from Indian plate - released fluids and mafic melts derived from mantle metasomatized by subducted Indian continental materials .
Involvement of isotopically ancient Indian continental materials increased from east ( Qulong ) to west ( Zhunuo ) , which is interpreted to reflect an increasingly shallower angle of the downgoing Indian slab from east to west , consistent with geophysical imaging .
Exploration of Gangdese Miocene porphyry copper deposits should focus on the Paleocene - Eocene arc where the subarc mantle was mainly enriched by fluids from the subducted Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab .
Neodymium - Hf isotope data for mineralizing igneous rocks from porphyry copper deposits globally show no obvious correlations with Cu endowment .
Although Nd - Hf isotopes are useful for imaging lithospheric architecture through time , caution must be taken when using Nd - Hf isotopes to evaluate the potential endowment of porphyry copper deposits , because other factors such as tectonic setting , crustal thickening , magma differentiation , fluid exsolution , and ore - forming processes all play roles in determining Cu endowments and grades .
Porphyry - type mineralization above subduction zones generally shows some variability of mineralization styles and ages and geochemistry of mineralizing intrusions along and across strike of magmatic arcs ( Kay et al . , 1999 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Jones et al . , 2015 ; Angerer et al . , 2018 ) .
However , it is not clear whether such variability occurs in continental collision zones .
Many porphyry copper deposits have been recognized in the continental collision zones of the Tethys orogen , including the Gangdese belt in southern Tibet , the Chagai belt in Pakistan , and the Arasbaran - Kerman belt in Iran ( Hou and Zhang , 2015 ) .
Variability of collisionrelated porphyry copper deposits along or across these orogens has been poorly understood .
In this study , we focus on porphyry mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
It was recently noted that the Gangdese porphyries exhibit distinct acrossstrike metallogenic variability characterized by porphyry Cu mineralization in the southern Lhasa subterrane and porphyry Mo mineralization in the central Lhasa subterrane ( Fig . 1B ; Sun et al . , 2017b ) .
However , it is unclear whether there is along - strike variability of porphyry copper mineralization in the Gangdese belt , despite many studies providing geochronological and geochemical data for ore - related intrusions and associated mineralization ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2015aLi et al . , 2011 ; Leng et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015Yang et al . , , 2016aSun et al . , 2017aSun et al . , , 2018 .
Here , we present new zircon U - Pb and Hf - O and bulkrock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene ore - related intrusions from five Gangdese porphyry copper deposits ( Qulong , Lakange , Chongjiang , Jiru , Zhunuo ) and Eocene felsic and gabbroic rocks from the western Gangdese belt .
Combined with literature data , our new results enable recognition of the contrasting isotopic characteristics of porphyry copper mineralization along the strike of the Gangdese belt , which has important implications for exploration of collision - related porphyry copper deposits .
The Gangdese batholiths in the southern Lhasa subterrane were emplaced from the Middle Triassic to the Miocene Zhu et al . , 2011Zhu et al . , , 2015Hou et al . , 2015b , and references therein ) .
Our syntheses of all published and new Nd - Hf isotopes indicate that there are distinct spatial isotopic variations along the Gangdese belt from precollisional to collisional magmatism ( Fig . 3 ) .
Both the Middle Triassic - Jurassic ( ~ 237 - 152 Ma ) and the Cretaceous ( ~ 137 - 65 Ma ) arc magmatic rocks have depleted Nd - Hf isotope compositions , consistent with their derivation mainly from the juvenile Neo - Tethyan mantle wedge ( Fig . 3A - D ) .
Exceptions are at Daggyai Co and from Lhasa to Gongbogymda ( ~ 91° - 93°E ; Fig . 1B ) , where there are large variations of εNd ( t ) and εHf ( t ) , suggesting probable crustal contamination by local Archean - Paleoproterozoic Lhasa basement ( Fig . 3A - D ; Hou et al . , 2015b ) .
The Paleocene - Eocene ( ~ 65 - 40 Ma ) and Miocene ( ~ 21 - 13 Ma ) intrusions were emplaced during the India - Asia con - tinental collision over a large area from Gaer to Nyingchi ( Fig . 1B ) .
It was previously shown that the Paleocene - Eocene rocks in the western Gangdese belt ( west of ∼89°E ) generally have higher initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios and lower εNd ( t ) values than those in the eastern Gangdese belt ( east of ∼89°E ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) .
50 Ma Xiani gabbros and granites at ∼86°E are consistent with previous interpretations ( Fig . 3E , F ) .
More importantly , both the mafic and felsic Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks show similar spatial isotopic variations with their εNd ( t ) and εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then decreasing toward ~ 95°E ( Fig . 3E , F ) .
These spatial trends are also exhibited by the Miocene ( ~ 21 - 13 Ma ) mineralizing and barren granitoids ( Fig . 3G , H ) , but not the precollisional Triassic - Cretaceous intrusions ( Fig . 3A - D ) .
Given that the precollisional arc rocks at ~ 88° to 95°E have depleted Nd - Hf isotopes ( Fig . 3A - D ) , the more unradiogenic Nd - Hf isotopes of the Paleocene to Miocene rocks most likely reflect the involvement of the subducted Indian continental materials with low ε Nd ( t ) and εHf ( t ) values ( Chu et al . , 2011 ) .
This interpretation is supported by geophysical results showing a N - dipping subducted Indian continental lithosphere and transport of Indian crust north of the Yarlung Zangbo suture ( Replumaz et al . , 2010 ; Gao et al . , 2016 ) .
In addition , the contributions of subducted Indian components to collisional magmas along the Gangdese belt probably decreased from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then increased from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E , in keeping with the spatial isotopic variations of the Paleocene to Miocene igneous rocks ( Fig . 3E - H ) .
The origin of Miocene ore - related intrusions in the Gangdese belt remains highly controversial , but it is generally accepted that either subduction - modified juvenile Tibetan lower crust or metasomatized mantle - derived mafic magmas played major roles in their formation ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2015aYang et al . , 2015Yang et al . , , 2016aSun et al . , 2018 ; .
The Paleocene - Eocene intrusions crop out within or nearby all known Miocene porphyry copper deposits ( Fig . 4A ) and have more juvenile Nd and Hf isotope compositions than the Miocene mineralizing granitoids at individual deposits when all data are recalculated to 15 Ma ( Fig . 4B , C ) .
It suggests the Miocene rocks involved a less radiogenic component , which is most likely the subducted Indian continental materials with unradiogenic Nd and Hf isotopes ( Guo et al . , 2013 ; Yang et al . , 2016a ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) .
The Miocene mineralizing intrusions have large variations in zircon oxygen isotope ratios , which range from mantle - like ( 5 . 3 ± 0 . 6‰ , 2σ ; Valley et al . , 1998 ) to supracrustal δ 18 O values ( up to 8‰ ; Fig . 5 ) , consistent with involvement of mantle and supracrustal components in their genesis ( Kemp et al . , 2006 ) .
We propose a three - component mixing model to explain the large variations of Sr - Nd isotopes of the Miocene mineralizing intrusions ( [ 87 Sr / 86 Sr ] ( t = 15 Ma ) = 0 . 7048 - 0 . 7091 ; εNd ( t = 15 Ma ) = - 6 . 9 to 2 . 4 ; Figs . 6 , 7 ) .
The three components include Indian plate - released fluids , subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust , and mafic magmas derived from mantle metasomatized by Indian continental materials ( Fig . 7 ) .
Given the subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust is heterogeneous , as shown by the spatial isotopic variations of Paleocene - Eo - A3 and A4 .
cene igneous rocks ( Fig . 3E , F ) , the local Paleocene - Eocene gabbros were chosen to represent Tibetan lower crustal end member at different localities ( Table 3 ; Fig . 7 ) .
The modeling results show that the proportion of Indian plate - released fluids increased from Qulong , Jiama , and Lakange ( 0 - 10 % ) in the east to other deposits ( Dabu , Chongjiang , Tinggong , and Zhunuo ; 10 - 25 % ) in the west .
Similarly , the proportion of metasomatized mantle - derived magmas also increased from Qulong , Jiama , Lakange , and Dabu ( mostly < 5 % ) in the east to Chongjiang , Tinggong , and Zhunuo ( mostly 10 - 25 % ) in the west ( Fig . 7 ) .
This westward - increasing contribution of Indian continental components during Miocene mineralization could reflect increasingly shallower angle of subducted Indian lithosphere from east ( Qulong ) to west ( Zhunuo ) as imaged by geophysical data ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ; .
Along - strike variation of subduction angle during the Miocene could have led to slab tearing ( Chen et al . , 2015 ; Guo et al . , 2018 ; Li and Song , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) , leading to formation of five distinct porphyry copper districts in the Gangdese belt ( Fig . 8 ) .
The along - strike isotopic variation along the Gangdese belt is consistent with new geophysical evidence suggesting a seg - The zircon U - Pb ages ( Ma ) of pre - Miocene intrusions ( Wen , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ; Zheng et al . , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ; Wu et al . , 2016 ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) are labeled on ( A ) .
Nd - Hf isotope data for igneous rocks within and nearby deposits are recalculated to 15 Ma and are shown in Appendix Tables A3 and A4 .

mented subducting Indian slab ( Figs . 3E , F , 8 ; Li and Song , 2018 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) .
The segment between ~ 86° and ~ 92°E hosts all known Gangdese Miocene porphyry copper deposits , which are found above a steeper Indian slab segment that was less metasomatized by Indian continental materials than other segments ( Figs . 3E , F , 8 ) .
By contrast , the segments to the west of ~ 86°E and east of ~ 92° to ~ 95°E were strongly metasomatized by Indian continental components above flatter slabs - these segments do not host any Miocene porphyry deposits .
The lack of porphyry deposits above flatter Indian slab is at odds with previous observations that young giant porphyry deposits coincide with domains of flat slab subduction in circum - Pacific arcs ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
We speculate that this discrepancy is due to the continental nature of the subducting Indian slab , which likely contains less chlorine , sulfur , and water than subducting oceanic slab .
The Nd - Hf isotopes are effective in imaging large - scale lithospheric architecture through time ( Hou et al . , 2015b ) .
Previous studies have proposed that isotopic values of ore - related intrusions are correlated with metal endowment of porphyry copper deposits in collisional zones ( Hou et al . , 2013 ; Asadi , 2018 ; Deng et al . , 2018 ) .
However , our larger Nd - Hf isotope data show that there are no obvious positive correlations between copper metal tonnage and bulk - rock ε Nd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values on a global scale ( Fig . 9 ) .
We advise caution when using Nd - Hf isotopes for predicting metal endowment of porphyry deposits , because other factors such as tectonic setting , crustal thickening , magma differentiation , Fig . 5 .

fluid exsolution , and ore - forming processes all play roles in determining Cu endowment and grades ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Chiaradia , 2014 ; Zhang and Audétat , 2017 ) .
Gangdese Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks and Miocene granitoids have systematic along - arc isotopic variations , characterized by bulk - rock εNd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and decreasing from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E .
The amounts of subducted Indian continental materials involved in mantle metasomatism decreased from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then increased from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E during the Paleocene - Eocene due to variations in the subduction angle of the segmented Indian slab .
The Miocene porphyry Cu deposits are located above a steeper Indian slab segment , and their genesis involved Indian plate - released fluids , metasomatized mantle - derived mafic magmas , and Tibetan lower crust .
Our results highlight that caution must be taken when using Nd - Hf isotopes for predicting metal endowment of porphyry deposits .

Chongjiang is a low - grade porphyry Cu deposit , located in the Gangdese belt , south Tibet .
The petrogenesis and geodynamic settings of the Miocene intrusions associated with the deposit remain controversial .
This study presents new results on in situ zircon Hf - O isotopic compositions and U - Pb ages , whole rock major and trace elements , and Sr - Nd isotopes for the adakitic intrusions from Chongjiang deposit .
The ore - bearing biotite monzogranite porphyry has adakitic characteristics , with enriched large - ion - lithophile elements ( LILE ) and light rare earth elements ( LREE ) , and depleted in high - field - strength elements ( HFSE ) , P and Ti .
LA - ICP - MS zircon U - Pb dating indicates that the ore - bearing and barren adakites were emplaced at 14 . 9 ± 0 . 3 Ma and 12 . 9 ± 0 . 3 Ma , respectively .
The porphyry is characterized by relatively high initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios ( 0 . 7059 to 0 . 7066 ) , and negative whole - rock ε Nd ( t ) values ( − 3 . 8 to − 2 . 6 ) .
Zircon δ 18 O is slightly higher than mantle values ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 2‰ ) , with varied ε Hf ( t ) ( −1 . 0 to 7 . 6 ) .
Most of the in situ zircon Hf - O isotopic data plot in a binary mixing trend between MORB and lower continental crust - derived melts .
These results indicate contributions from mixing of a mantle - like source ( e . g . , slab melts ) with continental crust .
Interestingly , most of the samples plot in the field defined by Dabie adakites ( representing partial melting of the lower continental crust ) , with several samples near / in the circum - Pacific adakite field ( representing partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs ) , which seemingly indicates that Chongjiang adakites mostly formed through partial melting of lower continental crust , with a small amount derived from oceanic slab melts .
These may be plausibly explained by plagioclase retention in the thickened Tibetan continental crust , which lowers Sr contents in the magmas during crustal assimilation .
Such a model is supported by other adakite discrimination diagrams , which all point towards slab melting .
Crustal contamination can compellingly explain the low grade of the Chongjiang deposit .
Considering the temporal - spatial distribution of porphyry Cu deposits , geochemical characteristics and high oxygen fugacity , we propose that the subducting Ninetyeast Ridge probably played a critical role in controlling the formation of Miocene adakites and porphyry copper deposits in the eastern Gangdese belt .
Porphyry Cu deposits are mainly located above active subduction zones ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2015 .
It also has been proposed that porphyry deposits may form in continent - continent collisions or post collisional settings ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ; Hou et al . , 2004bRichards , 2009 ) .
The Gangdese porphyry belt on the south Tibetan Plateau has been taken as the best example of a post - collision porphyry deposit ( Hou et al . , 2004b ( Hou et al . , , 2015Qu et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
A number of porphyry and related skarn Cu ( Mo , Au , and Pb - Zn ) deposits were discovered in this belt ( Fig . 1a ) , including Jiama , Qulong , Tinggong , Chongjiang , Bairong , Zhunuo , etc .
Some porphyry Cu deposits in this belt have been well studied , such as Qulong and Jiama ( Hu et al . , 2015b ; Qin et al . , 2014 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ; Ying et al . , 2014 ) .
The Chongjiang deposit , located in the western part of the eastern section of the Gangdese belt ( Fig . 1a ) , is a low - grade porphyry Cu ( Mo ) deposit ( Lin et al . , 2004 ; Mo et al . , 2006 ; Xie et al . , 2006Xie et al . , , 2007 .
These deposits are controversial with regard to the source region of the Gangdese ore - bearing adakitic magmas , and their tectonic settings .
Different models have been proposed for the formation of adakites in the south Tibetan Plateau , including the ' convective removal ' model ( Chung et al . , 2003 ( Chung et al . , , 2005Miller et al . , 1999 ; Williams et al . , 2004 ) , and ' slab roll - back and break - off ' ( Aitchison et al . , 2009 ; Davies and Von Blanckenburg , 1995 ; Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Miller et al . , 1999 ; Pan F . B .
et al . , 2012 ; Wang R . et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Williams et al . , 2004 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) .
Remelting of the lower crustal sulfide - bearing Cu - rich Jurassic cumulates ( Hou et al . , 2015 ) , and partial melting of subducted oceanic slab ( Hu et al . , 2015b ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) , have been proposed for the formation of adakites with porphyry mineralization .
In this study , we report systematic in situ zircon U - Pb ages and Hf - O isotopic compositions , whole rock major and trace elements , and Sr - Nd isotope data for the adakites from the Chongjiang deposit , aiming at deciphering the origin of the adakite , constraining the tectonic setting and better understanding the formation of Chongjiang porphyry copper deposit .
Two samples of Chongjiang ore - bearing adakites were dated at 14 . 9 ± 0 . 3 and 14 . 8 ± 0 . 3 Ma .
An ore - barren adakite dyke formed at 12 . 9 ± 0 . 3 Ma .
The combination of high ε Hf ( t ) , ε Nd ( t ) , high oxygen fugacity , and porphyry Cu mineralization itself favors an interpretation that the ore - forming adakitic melts are derived mainly from slab melting , with contributions from the thickened lower crust .
Diagrams of Zr / Hf versus Th / U , Mg # versus SiO 2 also suggest major contributions from slab melting .
In general , the Sr / Y versus ( La / Yb ) N diagram is a good diagram that discriminates slab melting from lower continental crust melting .
However , it does not work for Chongjiang , possibly because of the presence of plagioclase in crustal processes in a thickened continental crust .
The Sr / Y - ( La / Yb ) N discrimination diagram , along with diagrams of Hf - O and Zr / Hf - Th / U , reveal that the Chongjiang adakitic melts involved more continental crust components than that of Qulong deposit , although both of them are mainly derived from oceanic slab melting .
The low grade and relatively small scale of the Chongjiang deposit can be explained by serious crustal contamination .
Neither the lower continental crust , nor relics of subducted oceanic crust are the main contributors to the Chongjiang porphyry Cu deposit .
The subducting Ninetyeast Ridge probably played a critical role in controlling the formation of Miocene adakites and porphyry copper deposits in the eastern Gangdese belt .
However , further investigation is needed to reveal more details about the magmatic processes .

Most porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposits are found in magmatic arcs worldwide , and are associated with hydrous , high - fO 2 , calc - alkaline magmas , derived from a mantle wedge that was metasomatized by the fluids from a subducted oceanic slab .
Recently , such deposits have been documented as occurring widely in collisional settings , where they are associated with potassic magmas generated during the collisional process , but the genesis of the fertile magmas and the mechanism of metallic enrichment remain controversial .
Here we present new geochemical and Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic data from the post - collisional fertile and barren porphyries of the Miocene Gangdese porphyry belt in the Tibetan orogen , an orogen formed by the collision of India and Asia in the early Cenozoic .
Both types of porphyry are characterized by high K 2 O contents , and have geochemical affinities with adakite , but the fertile magmas were most likely derived from the melting of a thickened juvenile mafic lower - crust , formed by the underplating of earlier asthenospheric melts at the base of crust , whereas the derivation of the barren magmas involved variable amounts of old lower - crust in Tibet .
The melting of sulfide - bearing phases in the juvenile mantle components of the Tibetan lower - crust probably provided Cu , Au , and S to the fertile magmas .
The breakdown of amphibole during melting at the source released the fluids necessary for the formation of the porphyry Cu deposits in Tibet .
The thickened crust ( up to 70 - 80 km ) , due to collision , is thought to be responsible for a decrease in the fO 2 of the fertile magmas during their ascent to the upper crust , thus preventing the generation of more porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in this collisional zone .
Most porphyry Cu deposits are found in association with subduction - related calc - alkaline felsic magmas , and occur in magmatic arcs worldwide ( Sillitoe 1972 ( Sillitoe , 2010 .
Such deposits form from hydrothermal fluids exsolved from hydrous , high - fO 2 , sulfur - rich , arc magmas ( Hedenquist et al . 1998 ; Seedorff et al . 2005 ) , derived from a mantle wedge metasomatized by fluids expelled from the subducting slab ( Arculus 1994 ) .
These subsequently are affected by the processes of melt assimilation , magma storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) on reaching the crust / mantle boundary ( Hildreth and Moorbath 1988 ; Richards 2003 ) .
The MASH process generates andesitic to dacitic melts which then have to ascend to within 3 - 5 km of the Earth ' s surface where the ore fluids are exsolved ( Candela 1992 ; Seedorff et al . 2005 ) .
High oxidation states ( ~ 1 - 3 log fO 2 units higher than the fayalite - magnetite - quartz buffer ) in the arc magmas , as well as high H 2 O contents ( ≥4 . 0 wt . % ) , are regarded as critical factors in the generation of porphyry Cu systems in arc settings ( Mungall 2002 ; Richards 2003 ; Seedorff et al . 2005 ) .
Recent studies have shown that porphyry Cu deposits in continental collision zones are also associated with collision - related high - K felsic magmas ( Hou et al . 2003aRichards 2009 ) .
Classic areas for such deposits include the eastern Tethian domain ( Hou et al . 2011 ) where numerous large porphyry deposits occur within the Himalayan - Tibetan orogen ( e . g . , the Yulong and Gangdese porphyry Cu belts in Tibet ; Rui et al . 1984 ; Tang and Luo 1995 ; Hou et al . 2003a , and the Alpine - Himalayan orogeny ( e . g . , the Sungun and Sar - Cheshmeh Cu - Mo deposits in Iran ; Hezarkhani and Williams - Jones 1998 ; Calagari 2003Calagari , 2004Cooke et al . 2005 ; Singer et al . 2005 ; Zarasvandi et al . 2005 ; Hezarkhani 2006a , b ; Shafiei et al . 2009 ) .
These deposits are dominated by Cu - Mo , and are mainly associated with shoshonitic and high - K calc - alkaline magmas that have geochemical affinities with adakite ( Hou et al . 2004Shafiei et al . 2009 ) .
They show broad similarities to arc analogues in many respects , such as in the metallic associations , mineralization styles , alteration zones , and ore - forming fluids ( Hou et al . 2003aCooke et al . 2005 ) , but they differ from arc analogues in that they are emplaced within a post - collisional environment , have high - K adakite - like host rocks , and have a crustal - dominated source of the hydrous , high - fO 2 , fertile magmas ( Hou et al . 2011 ) .
However , the key processes for the generation of these collision - related porphyry Cu deposits are poorly understood , and the genesis of the fertile collision - related hydrous magmas and the mechanisms of metal enrichment in such magmas remain controversial . A major uncertainty comes from the lack of systematic studies on barren and fertile magmas of the same age in collisional settings .
This can be approached by further study of the Miocene porphyritic granitoids , with or without Cu - Mo mineralization , that formed during a post - collisional period , and which are now exposed in the Gangdese igneous belt of Tibet ( Fig . 1 ; Chung et al . 2003 ; Hou et al . 2004 ; Gao et al . 2007 ; Xu et al . 2010 ) .
Various petrogenetic models for the mildly to strongly alkaline adakite - like magmas in non - arc settings have been proposed : ( 1 ) the melting of subcontinental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) previously modified by subduction processes ( Gao et al . 2007 ( Gao et al . , 2010Richards 2009 ) ; ( 2 ) melting of thickened old lower - crust ( Chung et al . 2003 ; Xu et al . 2010 ) ; and ( 3 ) melting of thickened juvenile ( newly - formed ) mafic lower crust ( Hou et al . 2004 ; Chung et al . 2009 ) .
In order to further constrain the processes by which the fertile and barren magmas are generated , we present here new geochemical and isotopic data .
In particular , we present new in situ zircon Hf analyses from representative granitoid samples collected from different districts along the Gangdese igneous belt in Tibet .
By comparing the fertile and barren magma systems in Tibet , we are able to discuss the possible contributions of juvenile mantle components to a lower - crustal magma source below south Tibet , a collisional zone where fertile magmas and their associated porphyry Cu systems occur .
Porphyry Cu systems in the Tibetan - Himalayan orogen are associated with collision - related potassic magmas with geochemical affinities to adakite .
The fertile magmas are hydrous , relatively oxidized felsic melts , that were generated in the thickened and newly - formed mafic lower crust of Tibet .
In contrast , the barren magmas were derived from the old Tibetan lower crust .
The juvenile mantle components within the thickened lower - crustal source were put in place during underplating by older asthenospheric melts at the base of the Tibetan crust .
These melts probably formed during the Indo - Asia collision at 65 - 40 Ma , and are related to the roll - back and subsequent break - off of the Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab .
The re - melting of sulfide phases in the juvenile mantle components probably provided Cu , Au , and S in the fertile magmas .
The breakdown of amphibole at the source during melting released the fluids necessary for the formation of the porphyry deposits in Tibet .
The discontinuous distribution of the juvenile mantle components along the whole collisional zone results in clustering of the porphyry deposits in certain segments , where the fertile porphyries have relatively high values of ε Nd ( > −4 . 0 ) and ε Nd + ε Hf ( > −2 . 0 ) .
Jurassic arc magmatic rocks are widely distributed along the Gangdese belt , southern Tibet , however , only one Jurassic arc - related porphyry Cu deposit ( the Xietongmen deposit ) has been found .
The Jurassic arc magma fertility needs to be further constrained in order to understand the rarity of arc - related porphyry Cu deposits in this belt .
This paper seeks to combine new data on the Jurassic granitoid rocks with all published data on the Jurassic magmatic rocks in the Gangdese belt to comprehensively explore their geochemical variation and magma fertility .
Our new data show that the Jurassic granitoid rocks have zircon U - Pb ages of 171 . 6 ± 1 . 1 Ma to 195 . 3 ± 1 . 3 Ma .
These Jurassic granitoids are calc - alkaline series with SiO 2 contents of 59 . 4 to 70 . 7 wt % , Mg # values of 35 to 53 , and A / CNK values of 0 . 72 - 1 . 25 ( mainly < 1 . 1 ) .
They show enrichment in LREE and LILEs , depletion in HREE and HFSEs , and have depleted Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions .
These characteristics suggest that they were probably formed by the interaction of mantle - wedge - derived basaltic magmas with juvenile lower crust .
The compiled Jurassic magmatic rocks in the Gangdese belt generally contain amphibole and a mineral assemblage of titanite + magnetite + quartz .
These rocks have high whole - rock Sr / Y ( > 20 ) , V / Sc ratios ( > 8 ) and high zircon Eu N / Eu N * ( > 0 . 3 ) , Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios ( > 300 ) , and low titanium - in - zircon temperatures ( < 750 °C ) , except for some localized areas that deviate from the main trend .
These features indicate that nearly all Jurassic arc magmas in the Gangdese belt are water - rich and oxidized , which are fertile for porphyry Cu mineralization .
The rarity of the Jurassic subduction - related porphyry Cu deposits may result from subsequent erosion or insufficient exploration .
Porphyry Cu ( ± Mo ± Au ) deposits are typically associated with hydrous and oxidized magmas that formed in both arc and collisional settings ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Hou et al . , 2015a , b ; Sun et al . , 2013Sun et al . , , 2015 .
The lack of generation of these fertile magmas will reduce the potential for ore formation significantly , and even lead to large - scale barren systems ( Richards , 2013 ( Richards , , 2015 .
Therefore , assessment of magma fertility through mineral assemblage observations , whole rock geochemistry and mineral compositions is a key step to help evaluate the mineralization potential in a large magmatic belt ( Loucks , 2014 ; Richards , 2015 ) .
The Gangdese belt , located in the southern Tibet , underwent the processes of the Mesozoic subduction of Neo - Tethyan oceanic crust and the Cenozoic collision of Indian with Asian Blocks ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Chu et al . , 2006 ; Hou et al . , 2015a , b ; Zhu et al . , 2011Zhu et al . , , 2015Zhu et al . , , 2017 .
Collision - related porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are well developed in the Gangdese belt , forming a Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo deposit belt ( Fig . 1 ; Hou et al . , 2015a , b ) .
In contrast , subduction - related porphyry Cu deposits are very rare with only one Jurassic porphyry Cu - Au deposit found so far , Xietongmen deposit ( Tafti et al . , 2014 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) .
This phenomenon is distinct from other subduction zones , such as the Andes belt , southwestern Pacific belt , and Central Asian Orogenic Belt , etc . , which have belt - scale subduction - related porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Richards , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
The rarity of subduction - related ( Jurassic ) deposits are thought to be controlled by Jurassic magmatic fertility variations within the Gangdese belt ( Hou et al . , 2015b ; Wang et al . , 2017a ) or late - stage erosion processes ( Zou et al . , 2017 ) .
However , no consensus has been reached on the variations in the fertility of Jurassic magmas , including the fertile western Gangdese belt ( Hou et al . , 2015b ) ; fertile southern Gangdese belt ( Wang et al . , 2017a ) .
Therefore , the spatial variations in the fertility of Jurassic arc magmas in the whole Gangdese belt need to be further constrained .
In this paper , we present mineral assemblage observations , wholerock geochemistry , zircon U - Pb ages and trace element data from Jurassic magmatic rocks in the Gangdese belt .
We combine these data with pre - existing published data to further explore the fertility of Jurassic magmas in the whole Gangdese belt .
A comprehensive zircon U - Pb , trace element , Hf isotopic , wholerock major and trace element and Sr - Nd isotopic study of Jurassic granitoid rocks in the Gangdese belt , together with pre - existing published data , has generated the following conclusions : ( 1 ) Our data show that the Jurassic granitoid rocks formed from 171 . 6 ± 1 . 1 to 195 . 3 ± 1 . 3 Ma , consistent with pre - existing published data .
The Jurassic granitoid rocks in the Gangdese belt are typical of arcrelated rocks that formed by the interaction of mantle - wedge - derived basaltic magmas and juvenile lower crust , and underwent crystal fractionation .
The Jurassic arc magmas in the Gangdese belt are generally waterrich and oxidized , which are fertile for porphyry Cu mineralization , except in some localized anomalous areas .
The lack of the Jurassic subduction - related porphyry Cu deposits in the Gangdese belt may result from subsequent erosion or insufficient exploration .
The eastern Gangdese magmatic belt ( between ~ 88°E and 94°E ) in southern Tibet preserves a series of Cenozoic collision - related igneous rocks that have formed since the start of the India - Asia collision at ~ 55 to 50 Ma .
The Paleocene - Eocene intrusive rocks have intermediate [ La / Yb ] N ratios ( average = 12 . 0 ± 8 . 6 , n = 150 , range = 1 . 15 - 64 . 0 ) , intermediate to low Sr / Y ratios ( mostly < 40 ) , and negative Eu anomalies ( average Eun / Eu * = 0 . 76 ± 0 . 19 , n = 150 , range = 0 . 23 - 1 . 33 ) .
They are mainly composed of equigranular pyroxene and plagioclase in mafic intrusions or porphyritic plagioclase and quartz in intermediate - felsic intrusions , with minor interstitial amphibole and biotite .
In contrast , Oligo - Miocene intrusive igneous rocks have high [ La / Yb ] N ratios ( Oligocene : average [ La / Yb ] N = 42 . 8 ± 17 . 0 , n = 35 , range = 23 . 2 - 93 . 2 ; Miocene : average [ La / Yb ] N = 28 . 5 ± 8 . 8 , n = 93 , range = 6 . 7 - 49 . 1 ) , high Sr / Y ratios ( > 40 ) , and weak or absent Eu anomalies ( Oligocene : average Eun / Eu * = 0 . 99 ± 0 . 27 , n = 35 , range = 0 . 67 - 1 . 58 ; Miocene : average Eun / Eu * = 0 . 95 ± 0 . 13 , n = 93 , range = 0 . 44 - 1 . 46 ) , and their mineralogy consists mainly of plagioclase , quartz , and amphibole as phenocrysts .
These geochemical and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the Paleocene - Eocene magmas were relatively dry and evolved primarily by fractionation of pyroxene and plagioclase , whereas the Oligo - Miocene magmas were more hydrous and fractionated significant amounts of hornblende and lesser plagioclase prior to upper crustal emplacement .
Oligocene and Miocene magmatic rocks crop out as small - volume intrusions and are associated with several large - to giant - sized porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au deposits , as well as numerous smaller porphyry and skarn deposits .
In contrast , earlier , more voluminous Paleocene - Eocene magmatism is only known to be associated with three small porphyry deposits .
Erosional loss of subvolcanic porphyry systems from the older Paleocene - Eocene sequence is not thought to be a controlling factor in this temporal difference of porphyry deposit distribution , because exhumation rates after 55 Ma were relatively low and coeval Linzizong volcanic rocks are extensively preserved in the Gangdese belt .
Instead , we suggest that differences in magmatic history and petrogenesis led to this restricted temporal distribution of porphyry deposits .
The Paleocene - Eocene magmas were generated during the onset of collision between India and Asia and were triggered by rollback of the Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab .
This magmatism records the final stage of subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath southern Tibet , and the relatively low water contents of these magmas may reflect final dehydration of the remnant Neo - Tethyan slab .
After oceanic slab breakoff at ~ 40 to 38 Ma , the Greater India slab began to subduct beneath the Gangdese belt until hard collision with the Indian continent at ~ 35 Ma and breakoff of the Greater India slab at ~ 25 to 10 Ma .
This last event is suggested to have caused asthenospheric mantle upwelling and partial melting of subduction - modified , hydrated Tibetan lithosphere .
The resultant partial melts may have remobilized metals residual in the deep lithosphere from previous arc magmatism , giving rise to a suite of postsubduction porphyry - type ore deposits in the Oligo - Miocene .
The India - Asia continent - continent collisional orogen provides a unique opportunity to study the relationship between collisional tectonism , magmatism , and metallogenesis .
The India - Asia collision started at ~ 55 to 50 Ma ( Allégre et al . , 1984 ; Burg and Chen , 1984 ; Rowley , 1996 ; de Sigoyer et al . , 2000 ; Meng et al . , 2012 ) and was accompanied by voluminous but largely barren Paleocene - Eocene magmatism in southern Tibet ( Mo et al . , 2005 ; Wen , 2007 ; Chung et al . , 2009 ) .
These magmatic rocks constitute part of the Gangdese magmatic belt , which extends for more than 1 , 600 km east - west ( Fig . 1 ) .
Numerous small - volume plugs , dikes , and sills , locally associated with porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au deposits , were emplaced during later tectonomagmatic events in the Oligo - Miocene ( ~ 30 - 9 Ma ; Harrison et al . , 2000 ; Chung et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; Zheng et al . , 2012a , b ) .
This paper seeks to explain the change in fertility of collision - related magmas in the Gangdese belt from the Paleocene - Eocene to the Oligo - Miocene .
Two possibilities are considered : firstly , that originally abundant porphyry deposits in Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks have been eroded away , or , secondly , that the difference reflects fundamental changes in the style of magmatism , including magma source , geochemistry , and water content .
We approach a resolution to these temporal and spatial differences in metallogeny in the India - Asia collisional orogen by synthesizing new and existing geochronological and geochemical data with models of tectonic evolution and conclude that the controls on magma fertility reflect fundamental changes in tectonomagmatic processes .
Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks in the Gangdese magmatic belt have intermediate [ La / Yb ] N ratios ( average = 12 . 0 ± 8 . 6 , n = 150 ) , intermediate to low Sr / Y ratios ( mostly < 40 ) , and negative Eu anomalies ( average = 0 . 76 ± 0 . 19 , n = 150 ) , which suggest that mineral fractionation of these magmas was dominated by early pyroxene and plagioclase .
In contrast , Oligo - Miocene granitoids have higher [ La / Yb ] N ( average = 32 . 2 ± 12 . 0 , n = 128 ) and Sr / Y ratios ( mostly > 40 ) .
Least - evolved ( intermediate ) compositions in the Oligo - Miocene have much higher Sr contents and lower Y contents than equivalent Paleocene - Eocene rocks , suggesting early hornblende fractionation and minor or delayed plagioclase fractionation .
Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that amphibole is a common phenocryst phase in the younger granitoids , but is relatively rare and restricted to the groundmass or exists as late replacements of earlier pyroxene in the Paleocene - Eocene rocks .
We interpret these textures and geochemical evidence to indicate that the Oligo - Miocene magmas were more hydrous than the Paleocene - Eocene magmas .
The apparently water - poor Paleocene - Eocene magmas were generated during final subduction and dehydration of the remnant Neo - Tethyan oceanic lithosphere and are not associated with significant mineralization .
In contrast , the more hydrous Oligo - Miocene magmas are interpreted to have been derived from partial melting of subduction - modified Tibetan lithosphere in response to postsubduction asthenospheric upwelling and are associated with several large porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au deposits .
High magmatic water contents are essential for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits , and we therefore conclude that this increase in magmatic water content from the Paleocene - Eocene to the Oligo - Miocene in the Gangdese belt was essential to the formation of postsubduction porphyry deposits .
Miocene magmatism was triggered by Greater India slab breakoff and upwelling of asthenospheric melts and formed by partial melting of subduction - modified Tibetan lithosphere .
Porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au deposits formed from these hydrous magmas upon upper crustal emplacement .
Thrust systems are inferred from Yin and Harrison ( 2000 ) .
Depths of the Moho , Indian lithosphere - asthenosphere boundary , and Tibetan lithosphere - asthenosphere boundary are estimated from seismic studies ( Kumar et al . , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ) .
The Gangdese is a newly explored porphyry copper ore belt in China .
Except for the Cu ( ± Mo ± Au ) porphyry deposits there are some Mo ( ± Cu ± W ) porphyry and skarn deposits in this belt .
Two pulses of molybdenite mineralization are recognized in the central Lhasa subterrane with ancient continent crust , including the Paleocene - Eocene ( 65 - 52 Ma ) porphyry Mo and skarn Mo - W deposits formed during the rollback of Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab in collisional setting , and Miocene ( 21 - 15 Ma ) porphyry Mo - Cu deposits generated in the postcollisional setting .
The Gangdese copper deposits also occur during these two periods but are distributed in the southern Lhasa subterrane dominated by juvenile crust through mantle - derived magmatism resulting from Neo - Tethyan ocean lithosphere subduction .
The intrusions related to molybdenite mineralization have relatively lower bulk - rock ε Nd ( t ) and higher ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i values , lower zircon ε Hf ( t ) values and older Hf model ages , lower molybdenite Re contents , and more radiogenic Pb isotopes than the coeval copper related porphyries in the Gangdese belt .
In addition , the Miocene Mo - Cu related intrusions generally have lower zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios than the Miocene Cu ( ± Mo ) related intrusions .
These data indicate that more contributions from mature continental crustal materials play crucial role in the generation of Mo than Cu porphyry mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
The Eocene Mo related intrusions are characterized by high SiO 2 ( 68 - 76 % ) and K 2 O ( 5 . 1 - 5 . 9 % ) concentrations , enrichment of large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) , depletion of high field strength elements ( HFSE ) , and low Sr / Y ( 7 . 5 - 23 . 8 ) ratios .
Their Sr - Nd isotope compositions ( ε Nd ( t ) = − 3 . 4 to − 4 . 6 ; 87 Sr / 86 Sr ( i ) = 0 . 70622 - 0 . 70679 ) indicate that they are associated with partial melting of mantle wedge mixing with significant amounts ( 55 % - 65 % ) of middle - upper crustal materials .
The Miocene Mo - Cu related intrusions have relatively high SiO 2 ( 64 % - 73 % ) and K 2 O ( 1 . 9 - 4 . 8 % ) contents and are characterized by enrichment of LILE , depletion of HFSE , and high Sr / Y ratios ( 55 - 189 ) .
Their Sr - Nd isotope compositions ( ε Nd ( t ) = −4 . 6 to −3 . 4 ; 87 Sr / 86 Sr ( i ) = 0 . 70622 - 0 . 70679 ) are indicative of derivation from remelting of previously subduction modified Tibetan lithosphere with significant amounts ( 50 % - 70 % ) of middle - upper crustal materials .
For the Gangdese Mo ( ± Cu ) porphyry mineralization , Mo metal was suggested to be derived from the middle - upper crustal materials , particularly the Carbonaceous - Permian marine sedimentary , whereas Cu metal to be sourced from the Gangdese Miocene Cu fertile magmas .
The exploration targeting of the Gangdese molybdenite deposits should be focused on southern part of the central Lhasa subterrane where the Carbonaceous - Permian strata occur .
The occurrence of Mo - Cu porphyry deposits could provide clue for targeting Cu - Mo porphyry deposits in the Gangdese belt .
The Gangdese molybdenite deposits share many similarities with the East Qinling molybdenite deposits , such as type of ore deposits , geodynamic setting of their formation , variable Mo grades and high F contents .
Gangdese in the southern Tibet , China , is famous for the porphyry Cu ( ± Mo ± Au ) mineralization in a collisional setting , with the formation of the giant Qulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit ( Yang et al . , 2009 ( Yang et al . , , 2015 and many other large scale deposits ( e . g . , Dabu , Zhunuo ; Wu et al . , 2014a ; Zheng et al . , 2014aZheng et al . , , 2015a .
Except for the Cu ( ± Mo ± Au ) porphyry deposits there are some Mo ( ± Cu ± W ) porphyry and skarn deposits in the Gangdese belt ( Fig . 1 ) .
The petrogenesis of oreforming intrusions and ore controls ( e . g . , magma source , magmatic oxidation state , geodynamic setting ) of the Gangdese porphyry copper deposits have been widely studied ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2009 ( Hou et al . , , 2015Sun et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2014a , b ; Wu et al . , 2014aWu et al . , , 2016Lu et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ; Zheng et al . , 2004Zheng et al . , , 2007Zheng et al . , , 2015a .
By contrast , the regional metallogenesis and ore controls of the Gangdese Mo ( ± Cu ± W ) deposits are poorly understood although a few studies have focused on the petrogenesis of ore - related intrusions and fluid inclusions of individual deposits ( Wang et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ; Zhao et al . , 2012 ; Zhao et al . , 2015a ; Luo et al . , 2015 ) .
Molybdenum occurs as a byproduct in porphyry copper systems , or is the main ore component in porphyry Mo deposits .
According to the tectonic setting of their formation , three types of porphyry Mo deposits have been recognized , including ( 1 ) subduction - related type associated with calc - alkaline granitoids developed in subduction zone ( e . g . , Endako Mo deposit , Whalen et al . , 2001 ; MAX Mo deposit , Lawley et al . , 2010 ) , ( 2 ) Climax - type related to shallow intrusions of high silica rhyolites and granites formed in intra - cratonic rift or rift - related back - arc settings ( Richards , 2011 and references therein ) , and ( 3 ) collision - related type related to high - K calc - alkaline intrusions generated in post - collisional zone ( e . g . , East Qinling Mo deposits , Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2013 ) .
As for the Gangdese Mo deposits , the geodynamic setting of their formation remains unclear .
Based on the previous studies on the Gangdese Mo deposits , we provide supplementary ( Supplements 1 to 7 ) analyses of major and trace element compositions of ore - forming intrusion and sulfide sulfur and lead isotopes for the Eocene Sharang porphyry Mo deposit , Hf isotopes and trace element compositions of zircons from the Eocene Jiru Cu related intrusions , sulfide and bulk rock sulfur isotopes for the Miocene Bangpu porphyry Mo - Cu deposit , and zircon trace element compositions of the Miocene Dabu Cu related intrusions .
Together with the published data , we provide new insights into the origin of the ore - forming intrusions and ore controls of metal endowment and temporal - spatial distribution for the Gangdese Mo deposits .
This study will be helpful for further understanding the metallogenesis of porphyry Mo system and for exploration targeting in the Gangdese belt and other collisional zones .
The Gangdese Cenozoic Mo system in the southern Tibet is characterized by the Paleocene - Eocene ( 65 - 52 Ma ) porphyry - skarn Mo ( ± W ) and Miocene ( 21 - 15 Ma ) porphyry Mo - Cu mineralization .
They are distributed to north of the Gangdese Cu ( ± Mo ) deposits and in the central Lhasa subterrane .
These temporal - spatial distribution features are controlled by the source region of ore - forming magmas and geodynamic setting .
The Eocene Mo related intrusions are produced by partial melting of mantle wedge with involvement of significant amounts ( 55 % - 65 % ) of middle - upper crustal materials during the rollback of Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab in collisional setting .
The Miocene Mo - Cu related intrusions formed in the postcollisional setting and were associated with remelting of previously subduction modified Tibetan lithosphere with significant amounts ( 50 % - 70 % ) of middle - upper crustal materials .
The Mo ( ± Cu ± W ) related intrusions have relatively lower bulk - rock ε Nd ( t ) and zircon ε Hf ( t ) values , higher ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i values , older T DM C ages , more radiogenic Pb isotope compositions , and lower molybdenite Re contents than the coeval Cu ( ± Mo ± Au ) related intrusions in the Gangdese belt .
These indicate that more contributions from mature continental crustal materials play crucial role in the generation of Mo than Cu porphyry mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
Mo metal for the Gangdese Cenozoic molybdenite mineralization was mainly derived from middle - upper continental crustal materials , particularly the Carbonaceous - Permian marine sedimentary rocks in the central Lhasa subterrane .
Cu metal for the Gangdese Miocene Mo - Cu mineralization was sourced from the Gangdese Miocene Cu fertile magmas .
Exploration targeting of Cenozoic molybdenite deposits should be focused on southern part of the central Lhasa subterrane .
The occurrence of porphyry Mo - Cu deposits could provide a clue for targeting porphyry Cu - Mo deposits and thus we should pay more attention to the possibility of Cu - Mo porphyry mineralization at south of Tangbula Mo - Cu deposit in the southern Lhasa subterrane .
The Gangdese molybdenite deposits share many similarities with the East Qinling molybdenite deposits , such as type of ore deposits , geodynamic setting of their formation , variable Mo grades and high F contents .
High - Mg diorites and / or ultrapotassic volcanic rocks are generally associated with postcollisional porphyry copper deposits , but their contribution to the formation of the mineralization remains unclear .
A suite of Miocene postcollisional ultrapotassic - potassic lamprophyres , high - Mg diorites , and adakite - like intrusions have been recognized in the Zhunuo porphyry Cu deposit , located in a continental collisional zone within the Gangdese belt , southern Tibet .
The post - mineralization ultrapotassic - potassic lamprophyres have zircon U - Pb ages of 12Á2 6 0Á1 Ma and contain abundant Proterozoic to Miocene inherited zircons .
The ultrapotassic lamprophyres have high K 2 O ( > 8Á5 wt % ) and MgO ( > 8Á8 wt % ) contents , are enriched in light rare earth elements ( LREE ; La ¼ 123 ppm ) and large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ; e . g .
Ba ¼ 3102 ppm , Th ¼ 116Á6 ppm , and Pb ¼ 140 ppm ) , and display high Th / Yb and Rb / Sr , and low Ba / Rb and Hf / Sm ratios .
They have zircon e Hf ( t ) values of - 2Á8 to 1Á3 , d 18 O values of 6Á5 to 7Á4 & , and enriched bulk - rock Sr - Nd - Pb isotope compositions ( ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i ¼0Á73134 , e Nd ( t ) ¼ - 13Á7 , ( 206 Pb / 204 Pb ) i ¼ 19Á20 ) .
Their parental magmas were derived from partial melting of an enriched mantle source that had been metasomatized by fluids and sediment - derived melts associated with Neo - Tethyan oceanic subduction and subsequent Indian continental lithosphere subduction .
The potassic lamprophyres have lower contents of K 2 O , MgO , REE and LILE than the ultrapotassic lamprophyres and ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i of 0Á710993 to 0Á711139 , e Nd ( t ) of - 12Á3 to - 12Á4 , and ( 206 Pb / 204 Pb ) i of 18Á59 to 18Á72 .
Taken together with observations of a negative trend between e Nd ( t ) and MgO content ; positive trends between ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i , ( 206 Pb / 204 Pb ) i and MgO content from ultrapotassic lamprophyres to potassic lamprophyres ; the existence of abundant Miocene inherited zircons showing similar ages and e Hf ( t ) values to the adakite - like intrusions ; and variable Hf / Sm ratios with some Hf / Sm ratios similar to adakite - like intrusions , we propose that the potassic lamprophyres were formed by mixing of ultrapotassic lamprophyre magmas with adakitelike magmas .
The syn - mineralization high - Mg diorites including diorite porphyry and enclaves hosted by the adakite - like intrusions at Zhunuo have zircon U - Pb ages of 13Á0 6 0Á2 Ma and
Porphyry copper deposits typically occur in magmatic arcs above subduction zones and are genetically related to intermediate to felsic , hydrous , calc - alkaline arc magmas that are predominantly formed by partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( e . g .
However , recent studies have shown that porphyry copper deposits also form in post - subduction or post - collisional settings ( e . g .
Hou et al . , 2004Hou et al . , , 2015aHou et al . , , 2015bPerello et al . , 2008 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) .
These deposits are genetically associated with adakite - like or high Sr / Y ( > 40 ) and mildly alkaline intrusions that are likely generated by remelting of subduction - metasomatized lithospheric mantle and / or lower crust ( e . g .
The origin of porphyry Cu - related magmas in post - subduction settings , however , is still highly controversial .
The Miocene Gangdese porphyry copper belt in southern Tibet is the archetypal example of a porphyry system developed in a continental collision zone .
There are currently two giant deposits ( Qulong and Jiama ; ! 2Á5 Mt Cu ) , four large deposits ( Zhunuo , Tinggong , Gangjiang , and Dabu ; ! 0Á5 Mt Cu ) , and many intermediate to small deposits ( Fig . 1 ) .
All these deposits formed between 21 Ma and 13 Ma , postdating the ca .
55 - 50 Ma Indo - Asian continental collision ( Replumaz et al . , 2010 ; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) by $40 Myr , and are spatially and temporally associated with intrusions with adakite - like geochemical signatures , such as high Sr / Y ( > 40 ) ( e . g .
The genesis of the Miocene adakite - like intrusions in the Gangdese belt is highly debated , with models proposing direct melting of a subducted slab ( Qu et al . , 2004 ) ; partial melting of metasomatized or subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004Hou et al . , , 2015aGuo et al . , 2007 ; Chu et al . , 2011 ) ; partial melting of mafic Indian lower crust ( Xu et al . , 2010 ) ; partial melting of enriched mantle that had been metasomatized by slab - derived adakite melts ( Gao et al . , 2007 ( Gao et al . , , 2010 ; or high - pressure differentiation of hydrous mafic partial melts of Tibetan mantle ( Lu et al . , 2015a ) .
It has been recently recognized that adakite - like intrusions are spatially associated with high - Mg diorites in the Gangdese belt .
Yang et al . ( 2015 ) investigated oreforming adakite - like porphyries ( with zircon U - Pb ages of 17Á6 6 0Á7 Ma to 16Á2 6 0Á3 Ma ; Hou et al . , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) and a diorite porphyry ( with a zircon U - Pb age of 15Á7 6 0Á2 Ma ) that intrudes a pre - ore adakite - like pluton in the Qulong porphyry copper deposit .
They argued that the diorite porphyry was a high - Mg diorite formed by mixing between an ultrapotassic magma and an adakite - like magma , derived from metasomatized Tibetan lithospheric mantle and juvenile Tibetan lower crust , respectively .
Exogenous water added during mixing of the ultrapotassic magma with the adakitelike magma or from dehydration of the subducting Indian continental plate , resulted in remelting of subduction - modified , eclogitized Tibetan lower crust and generation of ore - forming adakite - like magmas ( Yang et al . , 2015 ( Yang et al . , , 2016 .
However , ultrapotassic volcanic rocks have not been directly recognized at Qulong , although these rocks are widespread in the western Gangdese belt where no porphyry Cu deposits have been found ( Fig . 1 ) .
It is also unclear whether high - Mg diorites occur in other porphyry Cu deposits in the Gangdese belt .
The origins of ultrapotassic rocks and high - Mg diorites remain in dispute .
It has been suggested that the Miocene ultrapotassic rocks in the western Gangdese belt of southern Tibet were derived from partial melting of metasomatized Tibetan lithospheric mantle ( Turner et al . , 1996 ; Miller et al . , 1999 ; Mahe ´o et al . , 2002 ; Williams et al . , 2004 ) , but whether the metasomatic agents are subducted Tethyan oceanic sediments ( Gao et al . , 2007 ; Tommasini et al . , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2014a ) or Indian continental crustal material ( Mahe ´o et al . , 2002 ; Zhao et al . , 2009 ; Guo et al . , 2013Guo et al . , , 2015Yang et al . , 2016 ) remains unclear .
In contrast , Wang et al . ( 2016 ) argued that ultrapotassic magmas in southern Tibet were derived from Indian lithosphere rather than Tibetan lithosphere ; these rose through the Indian crust and interacted with the overlying hydrous Tibetan lithospheric mantle wedge and thickened lower crust to form hybridized Miocene , ore - forming , adakite - like magmas .
High - Mg diorites also occur in Archean granite - greenstone belts ( such rocks are known as sanukitoids ) , including the Superior Province of North America ( Shirey & Hanson , 1984 ) , the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia ( Smithies & Champion , 2000 ) , and the North China Craton ( Xu et al . , 2008 ; Qian & Hermann , 2010 ) .
These rocks are mostly late - to post - tectonic and volumetrically minor relative to the widespread trondhjemite - tonalitegranodiorite ( TTG ) suites ( Shirey & Hanson , 1984 ; Stern et al . , 1989 ; Stevenson et al . , 1999 ; Smithies & Champion , 2000 ; Whalen et al . , 2004 ; Kovalenko et al . , 2005 ) , and are generally temporally and spatially associated with adakite - like rocks .
It has been suggested that high - Mg diorites are products of the remelting of hybridized mantle peridotite that had previously been metasomatized by the addition of slab melts ( Smithies & Champion , 2000 ; Polat & Kerrich , 2001 ) , interaction of mantle peridotite with adakite - like melts derived from partial melting of delaminated lower continental crust ( Gao et al . , 2004 ; Whalen et al . , 2004 ; Huang et al . , 2008 ; Xu et al . , 2008 ) , or mixing of siliceous crustal melts and basaltic magmas derived from metasomatized mantle ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) .
The volcanic counterparts of high - Mg diorites have been referred to as high - Mg andesites ( HMA ) which are considered to be produced by hydrous melting of upper - mantle peridotite , triggered by direct addition of slab - derived aqueous fluids ( Tatsumi , 1982 ; Tatsumi & Ishizaka , 1982 ; Crawford et al . , 1989 ) .
Some HMA show adakite - like signatures and are related either to partial melting of subducted oceanic crust followed by interaction with the overlying mantle wedge ( Kay , 1978 ; Kelemen , 1995 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ; Rapp et al . , 1999 ; Kelemen et al . , 2003a ) , intracrustal recycling of the mafic - ultramafic to intermediate - felsic plutonic roots of magmatic arcs by normal mantle - derived basaltic magmas ( Chiaradia et al . , 2014 ) , mixing of mantle - derived basaltic magmas and crustal - derived dacitic magmas ( Streck et al . , 2007 ) , or deep crustal melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) and assimilationfractional - crystallization ( AFC ) processes ( Richards & Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Note that Miocene ultrapotassic rocks have been recognized at the Zhunuo and Bairong porphyry Cu deposits .

In this study , we recognize a suite of Miocene igneous rocks including ultrapotassic - potassic lamprophyres , high - Mg diorites represented by diorite porphyries and mafic microgranular enclaves hosted by a monzogranite porphyry , and intrusions of monzogranite and monzogranite porphyry with adakite - like chemistry in the Zhunuo porphyry Cu deposit in the Gangdese belt , southern Tibet .
We provide new zircon U - Pb age data , zircon Hf - O isotope data , whole - rock major and trace element compositions , and Sr - Nd - Pb isotope data for the suite of Miocene magmatic rocks at Zhunuo to constrain their origin and shed a new insight into the genesis of postcollisional porphyry copper deposits .
A suite of Miocene igneous rocks , including lamprophyres , high - Mg diorites and adakite - like intrusions has been identified from the Zhunuo porphyry copper deposit in the Gangdese belt of southern Tibet .
Ultrapotassic - potassic lamprophyres yielded zircon U - Pb igneous crystallization age of 12Á2 6 0Á2 Ma .
High - Mg diorites , composed of diorite porphyry and enclaves hosted by monzogranite porphyry , yielded zircon U - Pb ages of 13Á1 6 0Á2 Ma and 13Á0 6 0Á2 Ma , respectively .
Adakite - like intrusions composed of monzogranite and monzogranite porphyry yielded zircon U - Pb ages of 14Á7 6 0Á3 Ma and 14Á6 6 0Á2 Ma , respectively .
The Zhunuo ultrapotassic lamprophyres were derived from partial melting of a phlogopite - bearing peridotite mantle source that has been metasomatized by fluids and sediment - derived melts related to Neo - Tethyan oceanic subduction prior to India - Asia continental collision and the subsequent subducting Indian continent .
Mixing of ultrapotassic lamprophyre magmas with adakite - like magmas leads to formation of potassic lamprophyres .
The Zhunuo high - Mg diorites were derived from previously subductionmodified Tibetan lithospheric mantle with little to no input of Indian continental sediment .
Mixing with adakite - like magmas and fractional crystallization of hornblende and , or , titanite is responsible for the differentiation of the high - Mg diorites .
The mantle sources beneath the Zhunuo area are heterogeneous and are likely different in the vertical dimension .
Formation of adakite - like intrusions at Zhunuo is related to remelting of previously subductionmodified Tibetan lower crust and mixing between hydrous mantle - derived high - Mg dioritic magmas and lower crustal magmas .
The fertile post - collisional adakite - like intrusions in the Gangdese belt were formed by remelting of juvenile , previously subduction - modified , arc lower crust associated with the input of hydrous , mantlederived , high - Mg dioritic magmas in lower crustal MASH zones and , or , upper crustal adakite - like magma chambers .
They show highly variable bulkrock Sr - Nd - Pb and zircon Hf isotope compositions depending on the compositions of the subductionmodified arc lower crust and the mantle source of the high - Mg diorites which are heterogeneous along the Gangdese belt .
In contrast , the infertile postcollisional adakite - like intrusions were likely formed by remelting of a relatively old lower crust that was less reworked or rejuvenated by previous subductionrelated arc magmas , with little to input of hydrous mantle - derived high - Mg dioritic magmas .
The Jiru porphyry copper deposit in the Gangdese Porphyry Copper Belt ( GPCB ) is hosted by monzogranite and monzogranite porphyry with SHRIMP U - Pb ages of 48 . 6 ± 0 . 8 Ma and 16 . 0 ± 0 . 4 Ma , respectively .
Rhenium - Os ages of molybdenite from the monzogranite and monzogranite porphyry are 44 . 9 ± 2 . 6 Ma and 15 . 2 ± 0 . 4 Ma , slightly younger than ages of the host rocks , respectively .
These geochronological data indicate that there are two mineralization events at the Jiru deposit , in contrast to other porphyry deposits in the eastern part of the GPCB that are only Miocene in age .
The Eocene monzogranite is characterized by high SiO 2 ( 63 . 0 - 71 . 4 % ) and K 2 O ( 3 . 7 - 5 . 9 % ) , enrichment in LILEs , depletion in Nb , Ta , and Ti , moderate negative Eu anomalies ( dEu = 0 . 55 - 0 . 94 ) , and relatively low Sr / Y ( 14 - 39 ) and ( La / Yb ) n ( 9 - 20 ) ratios .
It also has young e Nd ( t ) values ( À0 . 43 to À0 . 25 ) , low initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios ( 0 . 7044 - 0 . 7048 ) , and young depleted - mantle model ages T DM ( 742 - 821 Ma ) , compared to Eocene melts derived from mature continental crust in the central Lhasa subterrane .
These geochemical features suggest that the Jiru monzogranite was most likely derived from the hydrated asthenospheric mantle wedge with involvement of subducted sediments related to the Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab breakoff .
The Miocene monzogranite porphyry contains hydrous phenocryst phases ( hornblende and biotite ) and displays LREE - enrichment patterns , with high Sr / Y ( 131 - 183 ) and ( La / Yb ) n ( 22 - 72 ) ratios , and weak or absent Eu anomalies .
The porphyry has slightly negative e Nd ( t ) values ( À3 . 8 to À3 . 5 ) , low initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios ( 0 . 7057 - 0 . 7058 ) , and young T DM .
The Miocene porphyry is likely the product of remelting of the stalled Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab , with input from the lower crust during the convective removal of thickened lithosphere below southern Tibet .
Recognition of the Eocene magmatic - hydrothermal ore - forming event indicates a newly recognized potential for copper resources of that age in the eastern GPCB .
Porphyry Cu deposits typically occur in subduction - related continental - and island - arc settings ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) .
Recently , a number of porphyry deposits in China ( Chen et al . , 2000 ( Chen et al . , , 2009Deng et al . , 2010aDeng et al . , , b , 2012Rui et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2004 ; Zheng et al . , 2004Zheng et al . , , 2007Zheng et al . , , 2012Xue et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) , central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan ( Rich - ards et al . , 2012 ) have been described as forming in collisional and post - collisional ( or post - subduction ) tectonic settings .
The porphyry deposits are generated by subduction of oceanic lithosphere , collisional lithospheric thickening , post - collisional subcontinental lithospheric mantle delamination , or post - subduction lithospheric extension ( Richards , 2009 ) .
Considering that magma generation beneath an arc may cease due to collision that terminates subduction ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ) , it is necessary to distinguish the subduction - related from the collision - or postcollision - related porphyry deposits in an orogenic belt .
The Gangdese Porphyry Copper Belt ( GPCB ) is located in the southern Tibet , is one of the most important Cu belts in China , and contains the largest porphyry Cu deposit in China , at Qulong with > 10 Mt ( metal ) Cu reserves , as well as many other large and medium sized deposits ( Zheng et al . , 2004 ) .
Most of these deposits were considered to form in a post - collisional tectonic setting in association with 18 - 12 Ma post - collisional intrusions ( Rui et al . , 2003 ) .
Recently , the Xiongcun porphyry Cu - Au deposit was discovered in the belt and shown to be associated with subduction of Neo - Tethyan Ocean at ca .
173 - 165 Ma ( Tafti et al . , 2009 ; Tang et al . , 2010 ) .
Therefore , the possibility exists of other syn - collisional porphyry deposits in the GPCB , in addition to the well recognized Jurassic subduction - and Miocene post - collision - related porphyry deposits .
The aim of this paper is to describe a porphyry copper deposit that formed during two episodes , one syn - collisional and the other post - collisional , in the Jiru area of the GPCB .
We provide geochronologic constraints on the two periods of mineralization , discuss the petrogenesis of the associated granitoids , and evaluate the potential of porphyry Cu mineralization associated with the Eocene and Miocene magmas .
Our results provide an improved understanding of the metallogenic and tectonic evolution of the southern Tibet .
The Jiru porphyry Cu deposit is characterized by two mineralization events , with ages of 44 . 9 Ma and 15 . 2 Ma , based on molybdenite Re - Os data .
The Jiru deposit is different from other porphyry Cu deposits in the GPCB , which are characterized by solely Miocene mineralization .
The early mineralization is associated with a 48 . 6 Ma monzogranite that was derived from the hydrated asthenospheric mantle wedge with involvement of subducted sediments associated with the Neo - Tethyan slab breakoff .
The later mineralization is associated with a 16 Ma monzogranite porphyry generated in a post - collisional setting and controlled by convective removal of thickened lithosphere of southern Tibet .
The associated magma is associated with partial melting of an enriched subcontinental lithospheric mantle metasomatized by stalled oceanic slab - derived fluids and melts mixing to variable degrees with lower crustal components .
We should not ignore the potential for Eocene porphyry Cu mineralization in the GPCB .
Not only does the Jiru Cu deposit show an Eocene mineralization event , but also Eocene mantle components are likely related to a mantle wedge hydrated by slab fluids and the slab melts , which typically have isotopic compositions identical to mantle rocks and are crucial to the formation of porphyry Cu deposits .
In contrast , to the west of ~ 88°E , subduction of the Indian plate has remained flat to the present day , preventing incursion of hot asthenosphere .
Consequently , cooler conditions in the deep Tibetan lithosphere resulted in limited crustal melting and the production of only small volumes of high - Sr / Y granitic magmas .
Trachytic melts ascending from the underthrust Indian or Tibetan plate were able to pass through the cooler lower crust and erupted in greater volume at surface , whereas only small volumes of high - Sr / Y granitoid magma were generated and are not associated with significant PCD mineralization .
The recent discovery of large porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) associated with Miocene ( 22 - 12 Ma ) granitoid magmas in the eastern section of the Paleocene - Eocene Gangdese magmatic arc in the Himalaya - Tibetan orogenic belt raises new questions about the origin of water - rich ( ≥4 . 5 wt . % ) , oxidized ( ΔFMQ 1 - 3 ) magmas in continental collisional settings and their mineralization potential . We review the literature and compile available data on whole rock and isotope geochemistry for Cenozoic igneous rocks from Tibet , and add new zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + and Ti - in - zircon thermometry data to better understand variations in oxidation state and thermal evolution of these suites , which are key controls on Cu mineralization .
Six distinct Cenozoic igneous suites are defined : Paleocene - Eocene syn - collisional Gangdese magmatic arc rocks ( ΔFMQ = −1 . 2 to + 0 . 8 ) ( suite I ) , and five broadly contemporaneous Miocene suites .
A distinct change in magmatism along the length of the belt occurs at around 88°E in the Miocene suites : to the east , porphyry copper mineralization is associated with a moderately oxidized , high - Sr / Y granitoid suite ( suite II , ΔFMQ = + 0 . 8 to + 2 . 9 ) with minor occurrences of transitional ( hybrid ) monzonitic ( suite III ) and trachytic rocks ( suite IV ; both with zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + > 50 - 100 , Eu N / Eu N * = ~ 0 . 5 , and ΔFMQ = ~ + 1 to + 2 ) .
To the west of 88°E , trachytic volcanic rocks ( suite V ) are more voluminous but more reduced ( zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + < 50 , ΔFMQ < + 1 ) , and are associated with sparse , poorly mineralized high - Sr / Y granitoids ( suite VI ) which are moderately oxidized ( zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + = 20 - 100 , ΔFMQ = ~ + 1 to + 3 ) .
The Miocene high - Sr / Y granitoids have many compositional and isotopic similarities to the Paleocene - Eocene Gangdese arc rocks , and are interpreted to have been derived by melting of the hydrated arc root , with minor mantle input .
In contrast , the highly evolved isotopic signatures of the Miocene trachytic rocks , combined with deep seismic profiles and a xenolith - derived geotherm , suggest their derivation from the underthrust Indian Proterozoic subcontinental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) or old fore - arc Tibetan SCLM during phlogopite breakdown at temperatures of ~ 1100 °C .
Based on published geophysical data and tectonic reconstructions , we develop a model that explains the origin of the various Miocene magmatic suites , their spatial differences , and the origin of related PCDs .
Following the early stages of continental collision ( Eocene - Oligocene ) , shallow underthrusting of the Indian continental lithosphere and subcretion of Tethyan sediments ( including oxidized carbonates and possibly evaporites ) under eclogite facies conditions promoted the release of aqueous fluids , which hydrated and oxidized the base of the overlying Tibetan plate .
This metasomatism rendered the Tibetan lower crust fusible and fertile for metal remobilization .
During the mid - Miocene , the Indian slab steepened in the eastern sector ( east of ~ 88°E ) .
In this eastern belt , deeply derived trachytic magmas were trapped in melt zones at the base of the Tibetan crust , and variably mixed with the crustally - derived , high Sr / Y granitoid magmas .
They may also have released water that contributed to fluid - fluxed melting of the lower crust , producing voluminous high - Sr / Y granitoid magmas , which were associated with significant PCD mineralization .
Hybridization between the trachytic magmas and lower crustal partial melts is indicated by intermediate isotopic compositions , enriched Cr and Ni contents , and high Mg # in some intermediate - to - felsic ( 56 - 70 wt . % SiO 2 ) high - Sr / Y granitoids .
Trapping of the trachytic melts in deep crustal melt zones explains the relatively small volumes of trachytic magmas erupted at surface in the east .
Porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) are generally associated with oxidized and H 2 O - rich magmas , which are the typical features of magmatic arcs ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
In island arcs and continental arcs , where porphyry deposits form , it is generally thought that oxidized , sulfur - rich fluids released from subducting slabs migrate into the asthenospheric mantle wedge , where they cause partial melting and mobilization of metals ( Richards , 2003 ; Audétat and Simon , 2012 ) and ultimately transfer these metals into the crust .
Recently , large PCDs have been found in association with postcollisional ( Miocene ; 22 - 12 Ma ) , high - Sr / Y granitoid plutons emplaced in the eastern section of the Paleocene - Eocene Gangdese magmatic arc in the Himalayan - Tibetan orogenic belt ( Fig . 1 ; Hou et al . , 2004Hou et al . , , 2015Yang et al . , 2009Yang et al . , , 2016Lu et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2014aWang et al . , , 2014bWang et al . , , 2015a .
These discoveries raise questions about the nature of magmatic and metallogenic processes during continental collision .
In the Gangdese magmatic arc , the porphyry - related intrusions are coeval with a suite of Miocene potassic volcanic rocks ( 24 - 8 Ma ) , which have been collectively termed ultrapotassic volcanic rocks ( UPVs ) in the literature ( Williams , 2000 ; Williams et al . , 2001Williams et al . , , 2004Ding et al . , 2003 ; Chung et al . , 2005 ; Zhao et al . , 2009 ; Zhou et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2014c ; Guo et al . , 2013Guo et al . , , 2015Liu et al . , 2014bLiu et al . , , 2015Liu et al . , , 2017Xu et al . , 2017 ) .
In this paper , we refer to this suite as trachytic .
However , there is a puzzling difference in the spatial distribution of the Miocene intrusive ( high - Sr / Y granitoid ) and trachytic volcanic suites along the length of the Gangdese belt , with abundant PCD - hosting granitoids cropping out east of ~ 88°E , but only a few poorly mineralized granitoids to the west ( Hou et al . , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014c ; Yang et al . , 2016 ) .
In contrast , trachytic volcanic rocks are relatively common along the Gangdese belt west of 88°E but rare along the east ( Fig . 1 ) .
A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the unusual origin of these Miocene PCDs and their high - Sr / Y granitoid hosts ( reviewed by Wang et al . , 2015a , andYang et al . , 2016 ) .
These hypotheses typically link the deposits to the recycling of the subduction - fertilized , deeper sections of the Paleocene - Eocene arc , and many ascribe the magmas to either the remelting of the Tibetan lower arc crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ( Chung et al . , , 2009Hou et al . , 2004 ; Li et al . , 2011 ) or the metasomatized Tibetan lithospheric mantle ( Lu et al . , 2015 ) , while some argue for hybrid magmas from both sources ( Wang et al . , 2015a ; Yang et al . , 2015Yang et al . , , 2016 .
However , none of these models explains all the features ( geochemistry , water content , redox state ) of these Miocene granitoids , and especially their relationship with coeval trachytic volcanic rocks .
Deep crustal and mantle xenoliths entrained by the Miocene trachytes provide direct information regarding crust - mantle hybridization ( Chan et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2014b ; Wang et al . , 2016 ) and suggest a relationship between the origin of high - Sr / Y granitoids and the coeval Miocene potassic volcanic rocks ( Wang et al . , 2017a ) .
The transition from subduction - related magmatism in the Paleocene to collisional magmatism in the Miocene is accompanied by significant changes in geochemical and isotopic ( Sr - Nd - Hf - O ) magmatic compositions ( Wang et al . , 2015a ( Wang et al . , , 2015bYang et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting that the underthrusting of the Indian plate was a major control on the nature of Miocene Gangdese magmatism .
Following the India - Asia collision at ~ 55 - 50 Ma ( Van der Voo et al . , 1999 ; de Sigoyer et al . , 2000 ; Meng et al . , 2012 ; Ding et al . , 2016 ; Zhu et al . , 2015Zhu et al . , , 2017 , the subsequent magmatic quiescence in the late Eocene - Oligocene reflects a shallowangle underthrusting of the Indian continental margin ( Guillot et al . , 2008 ; Ji et al . , 2009 ; Ding et al . , 2016 ) .
However , recent seismic studies revealed a contrasting Indian plate subduction geometry from west to east , with shallow underthrusting beneath the western Gangdese belt and steep underthrusting in the east ( Zhao et al . , 2010 ) .
By combining the location of a high - velocity seismic anomaly corresponding to the subducted Indian plate in the deep mantle with the paleogeographic position of India , Replumaz et al . ( 2010 ) suggested that steep subduction of India was initiated before 25 Ma .
We suggest that the transition to steeper subduction in the east should have occurred in the Miocene , thus leading to the opening of an asthenospheric mantle wedge in the east but not in the west .
Such differences impact the tectono - thermal regime of the evolving collisional system , and the impact on magmatism is shown by the differences in the spatial distribution of intrusive and volcanic suites in the Miocene .
Here , we review the major aspects of the geodynamic setting of the Himalayan - Tibetan orogen and the Miocene evolution of the Gangdese magmatic arc .
We start with a brief summary of the geological setting followed by an overview of the geodynamic aspects of the orogen .
We then use a compilation of 288 published geochemical and isotopic analyses to distinguish between the six Cenozoic igneous suites exposed in the Gangdese belt .
We add new titanium - in - zircon thermometry and zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + data to constrain the temperatures and redox states of these suites and new plagioclase compositional data to constrain the magmatic water contents .
These features are combined with geodynamic reconstructions to derive an integrated petrogenetic model for Miocene magmatism and mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
