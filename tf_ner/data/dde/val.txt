The E - trending Gangdese porphyry copper belt in southern Tibet is a classic example of porphyry mineralization in a continental collision zone .
New zircon U - Pb geochronological , zircon Hf - O , and bulk - rock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene mineralizing intrusions from the Qulong , Zhunuo , Jiru , Chongjiang , and Lakange porphyry copper deposits and Eocene igneous rocks from the western Gangdese belt , together with literature data , show that both Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks and Miocene granitoids exhibit coupled along - arc isotopic variations , characterized by bulk - rock εNd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then decreasing toward ~ 95°E .
These are interpreted to reflect increasing contributions of subducted Indian continental materials from ~ 92° to ~ 84°E and from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E , respectively .
The Miocene mineralizing intrusions were derived from subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust represented isotopically by the Paleocene - Eocene intrusions , with contributions from Indian plate - released fluids and mafic melts derived from mantle metasomatized by subducted Indian continental materials .
Involvement of isotopically ancient Indian continental materials increased from east ( Qulong ) to west ( Zhunuo ) , which is interpreted to reflect an increasingly shallower angle of the downgoing Indian slab from east to west , consistent with geophysical imaging .
Exploration of Gangdese Miocene porphyry copper deposits should focus on the Paleocene - Eocene arc where the subarc mantle was mainly enriched by fluids from the subducted Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab .
Neodymium - Hf isotope data for mineralizing igneous rocks from porphyry copper deposits globally show no obvious correlations with Cu endowment .
Although Nd - Hf isotopes are useful for imaging lithospheric architecture through time , caution must be taken when using Nd - Hf isotopes to evaluate the potential endowment of porphyry copper deposits , because other factors such as tectonic setting , crustal thickening , magma differentiation , fluid exsolution , and ore - forming processes all play roles in determining Cu endowments and grades .
Porphyry - type mineralization above subduction zones generally shows some variability of mineralization styles and ages and geochemistry of mineralizing intrusions along and across strike of magmatic arcs ( Kay et al . , 1999 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Jones et al . , 2015 ; Angerer et al . , 2018 ) .
However , it is not clear whether such variability occurs in continental collision zones .
Many porphyry copper deposits have been recognized in the continental collision zones of the Tethys orogen , including the Gangdese belt in southern Tibet , the Chagai belt in Pakistan , and the Arasbaran - Kerman belt in Iran ( Hou and Zhang , 2015 ) .
Variability of collisionrelated porphyry copper deposits along or across these orogens has been poorly understood .
In this study , we focus on porphyry mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
It was recently noted that the Gangdese porphyries exhibit distinct acrossstrike metallogenic variability characterized by porphyry Cu mineralization in the southern Lhasa subterrane and porphyry Mo mineralization in the central Lhasa subterrane ( Fig . 1B ; Sun et al . , 2017b ) .
However , it is unclear whether there is along - strike variability of porphyry copper mineralization in the Gangdese belt , despite many studies providing geochronological and geochemical data for ore - related intrusions and associated mineralization ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2015aLi et al . , 2011 ; Leng et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015Yang et al . , , 2016aSun et al . , 2017aSun et al . , , 2018 .
Here , we present new zircon U - Pb and Hf - O and bulkrock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene ore - related intrusions from five Gangdese porphyry copper deposits ( Qulong , Lakange , Chongjiang , Jiru , Zhunuo ) and Eocene felsic and gabbroic rocks from the western Gangdese belt .
Combined with literature data , our new results enable recognition of the contrasting isotopic characteristics of porphyry copper mineralization along the strike of the Gangdese belt , which has important implications for exploration of collision - related porphyry cop
Chongjiang is a low - grade porphyry Cu deposit , located in the Gangdese belt , south Tibet .
The petrogenesis and geodynamic settings of the Miocene intrusions associated with the deposit remain controversial .
This study presents new results on in situ zircon Hf - O isotopic compositions and U - Pb ages , whole rock major and trace elements , and Sr - Nd isotopes for the adakitic intrusions from Chongjiang deposit .
The ore - bearing biotite monzogranite porphyry has adakitic characteristics , with enriched large - ion - lithophile elements ( LILE ) and light rare earth elements ( LREE ) , and depleted in high - field - strength elements ( HFSE ) , P and Ti .
LA - ICP - MS zircon U - Pb dating indicates that the ore - bearing and barren adakites were emplaced at 14 . 9 ± 0 . 3 Ma and 12 . 9 ± 0 . 3 Ma , respectively .
The porphyry is characterized by relatively high initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios ( 0 . 7059 to 0 . 7066 ) , and negative whole - rock ε Nd ( t ) values ( − 3 . 8 to − 2 . 6 ) .
Zircon δ 18 O is slightly higher than mantle values ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 2‰ ) , with varied ε Hf ( t ) ( −1 . 0 to 7 . 6 ) .
Most of the in situ zircon Hf - O isotopic data plot in a binary mixing trend between MORB and lower continental crust - derived melts .
These results indicate contributions from mixing of a mantle - like source ( e . g . , slab melts ) with continental crust .
Interestingly , most of the samples plot in the field defined by Dabie adakites ( representing partial melting of the lower continental crust ) , with several samples near / in the circum - Pacific adakite field ( representing partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs ) , which seemingly indicates that Chongjiang adakites mostly formed through partial melting of lower continental crust , with a small amount derived from oceanic slab melts .
These may be plausibly explained by plagioclase retention in the thickened Tibetan continental crust , which lowers Sr contents in the magmas during crustal assimilation .
Such a model is supported by other adakite discrimination diagrams , which all point towards slab melting .
Crustal contamination can compellingly explain the low grade of the Chongjiang deposit .
Considering the temporal - spatial distribution of porphyry Cu deposits , geochemical characteristics and high oxygen fugacity , we propose that the subducting Ninetyeast Ridge probably played a critical role in controlling the formation of Miocene adakites and porphyry copper deposits in the eastern Gangdese belt .
Porphyry Cu deposits are mainly located above active subduction zones ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2015 .
It also has been proposed that porphyry deposits may form in continent - continent collisions or post collisional settings ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ; Hou et al . , 2004bRichards , 2009 ) .
The Gangdese porphyry belt on the south Tibetan Plateau has been taken as the best example of a post - collision porphyry deposit ( Hou et al . , 2004b ( Hou et al . , , 2015Qu et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) .
A number of porphyry and related skarn Cu ( Mo , Au , and Pb - Zn ) deposits were discovered in this belt ( Fig . 1a ) , including Jiama , Qulong , Tinggong , Chongjiang , Bairong , Zhunuo , etc .
Some porphyry Cu deposits in this belt have been well studied , such as Qulong and Jiama ( Hu et al . , 2015b ; Qin et al . , 2014 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2015 ; Ying et al . , 2014 ) .
The Chongjiang deposit , located in the western part of the eastern section of the Gangdese belt ( Fig . 1a ) , is a low - grade porphyry Cu ( Mo ) deposit ( Lin et al . , 2004 ; Mo et al . , 2006 ; Xie et al . , 2006Xie et al . , , 2007 .
These deposits are controversial with regard to the source region of the Gangdese ore - bearing adakitic magmas , and their tectonic settings .
Different models have been proposed for the formation of adakites in the south Tibetan Plateau , including the ' convective removal ' model ( Chung et al . , 2003 ( Chung et al . , , 2005Miller et al . , 1999 ; Williams et al . , 2004 ) , and ' slab roll - back and break - off ' ( Aitchison et al . , 2009 ; Davies and Von Blanckenburg , 1995 ; Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Miller et al . , 1999 ; Pan F . B .
et al . , 2012 ; Wang R . et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Williams et al . , 2004 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) .
Remelting of the lower crustal sulfide - bearing Cu - rich Jurassic cumulates ( Hou et al . , 2015 ) , and partial melting of subducted oceanic slab ( Hu et al . , 2015b ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) , have been proposed for the formation of adakites with porphyry mineralization .
In this study , we report systematic in situ zircon U - Pb ages and Hf - O isotopic compositions , whole rock major and trace elements , and Sr - Nd isotope data for the adakites from the Chongjiang deposit , aiming at deciphering the origin of the adakite , constraining the tectonic setting and better understanding the formation of Chongjiang porphyry copper deposit .
