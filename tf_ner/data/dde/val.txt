The E - trending Gangdese porphyry copper belt in southern Tibet is a classic example of porphyry mineralization in a continental collision zone .
New zircon U - Pb geochronological , zircon Hf - O , and bulk - rock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene mineralizing intrusions from the Qulong , Zhunuo , Jiru , Chongjiang , and Lakange porphyry copper deposits and Eocene igneous rocks from the western Gangdese belt , together with literature data , show that both Paleocene - Eocene igneous rocks and Miocene granitoids exhibit coupled along - arc isotopic variations , characterized by bulk - rock εNd ( t ) and zircon εHf ( t ) values increasing from ~ 84° to ~ 92°E and then decreasing toward ~ 95°E .
These are interpreted to reflect increasing contributions of subducted Indian continental materials from ~ 92° to ~ 84°E and from ~ 92° to ~ 95°E , respectively .
The Miocene mineralizing intrusions were derived from subduction - modified Tibetan lower crust represented isotopically by the Paleocene - Eocene intrusions , with contributions from Indian plate - released fluids and mafic melts derived from mantle metasomatized by subducted Indian continental materials .
Involvement of isotopically ancient Indian continental materials increased from east ( Qulong ) to west ( Zhunuo ) , which is interpreted to reflect an increasingly shallower angle of the downgoing Indian slab from east to west , consistent with geophysical imaging .
Exploration of Gangdese Miocene porphyry copper deposits should focus on the Paleocene - Eocene arc where the subarc mantle was mainly enriched by fluids from the subducted Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab .
Neodymium - Hf isotope data for mineralizing igneous rocks from porphyry copper deposits globally show no obvious correlations with Cu endowment .
Although Nd - Hf isotopes are useful for imaging lithospheric architecture through time , caution must be taken when using Nd - Hf isotopes to evaluate the potential endowment of porphyry copper deposits , because other factors such as tectonic setting , crustal thickening , magma differentiation , fluid exsolution , and ore - forming processes all play roles in determining Cu endowments and grades .
Porphyry - type mineralization above subduction zones generally shows some variability of mineralization styles and ages and geochemistry of mineralizing intrusions along and across strike of magmatic arcs ( Kay et al . , 1999 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Jones et al . , 2015 ; Angerer et al . , 2018 ) .
However , it is not clear whether such variability occurs in continental collision zones .
Many porphyry copper deposits have been recognized in the continental collision zones of the Tethys orogen , including the Gangdese belt in southern Tibet , the Chagai belt in Pakistan , and the Arasbaran - Kerman belt in Iran ( Hou and Zhang , 2015 ) .
Variability of collisionrelated porphyry copper deposits along or across these orogens has been poorly understood .
In this study , we focus on porphyry mineralization in the Gangdese belt .
It was recently noted that the Gangdese porphyries exhibit distinct acrossstrike metallogenic variability characterized by porphyry Cu mineralization in the southern Lhasa subterrane and porphyry Mo mineralization in the central Lhasa subterrane ( Fig . 1B ; Sun et al . , 2017b ) .
However , it is unclear whether there is along - strike variability of porphyry copper mineralization in the Gangdese belt , despite many studies providing geochronological and geochemical data for ore - related intrusions and associated mineralization ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2015aLi et al . , 2011 ; Leng et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2015Yang et al . , , 2016aSun et al . , 2017aSun et al . , , 2018 .
Here , we present new zircon U - Pb and Hf - O and bulkrock Sr - Nd isotope data for the Miocene ore - related intrusions from five Gangdese porphyry copper deposits ( Qulong , Lakange , Chongjiang , Jiru , Zhunuo ) and Eocene felsic and gabbroic rocks from the western Gangdese belt .
Combined with literature data , our new results enable recognition of the contrasting isotopic characteristics of porphyry copper mineralization along the strike of the Gangdese belt , which has important implications for exploration of collision - related porphyry copper deposits .
