Subduction processes are thought to ultimately cause enrichment of metals ( Cu , Au ) and S ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ) and the relatively high oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and high H 2 O contents in arc magmas ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) that are critical to the formation of PCDs .
The Jurassic arc rocks are mainly calc - alkaline , and are characterized by enrichment in large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE ; e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSE ; e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) with flat heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) , thus showing typical subduction - related geochemical features ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1993 ) .
The average zircon e Hf ( t ) values of the Jurassic rocks decrease significantly from the WSJA ( average + 16 ) to the ESJA ( average + 6 ) , suggesting distinct intra - crustal magmatic processes along the arc .
The India - Asia continental collision zone was built on a complex tectonic collage of terranes accreted onto the southern margin of the Asian continent since the Mesozoic ( Fig . 1A ; Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
The Miocene PCDs show a close spatial relationship with the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , despite being separated by a time interval of ~ 170 - 130 m . y .
Pronounced crustal thickening at 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) and subsequent slab break - off ( or tearing ) starting at 25 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) triggered this remelting as isotherms rebounded and / or hot asthenospheric melts infiltrated the lithosphere ( Richards , 2009 ) .
For example , the giant Qulong deposit ( 1420 Mt at 0 . 5 % Cu and 0 . 03 % Mo ; is partly hosted by Jurassic dacitic lavas .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions with those of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
By contrast , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are free of inherited zircons , and have relatively " depleted " isotopic compositions and younger Hf model ages ( average 800 Ma ) , suggesting a juvenile source ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2013a .
In addition , the Miocene Cu - Morelated porphyries have higher Sr / Y ratios ( 23 - 186 ) and higher ( La / Yb ) N ratios ( 11 - 47 ) than the Jurassic rocks , showing geochemical affinity with adakite ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
In contrast , localization of Miocene PCDs within the Jurassic arc implies that metal - rich Jurassic cumulates could release Cu into the Miocene porphyry systems ( Lee et al . . , 2012 ) .
Other PCDs are ~ 20 - 50 km away from Jurassic magmatic rocks ( Fig . 1B ) .
Geochemical and isotope data suggest that the WSJA arc rocks associated with the subduction - related PCDs derive from subductionmodified asthenospheric mantle ( Fig . 2 ; Fig . DR1 ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .
By contrast , incorporation of older crust by the ESJA basaltic rock , indicated by the lower and variable zircon e Hf ( t ) ( + 1 to + 12 ) , may be responsible for lowering magmatic f O 2 ( e . g . , Ripley and Li , 2013 ) , thus inducing sulfide saturation ( Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) and sequestering Cu - rich sulfides ( Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) in the Jurassic lower - crustal arc cumulates ( Fig . 3 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons from the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
This suggests that remelting of the Jurassic cumulates took place in a thickened crust ( > 50 - 55 km ) within the amphibole and garnet stability field ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) , consistent with Cenozoic collision - induced crustal thickening in south Tibet ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
Copper contents of primary magmas are controlled by the oxidation state of their source , which determines the stability of residual sulphide phases , the main host of Cu ( refs 8 , 11 ) : higher oxidation states in the source result in higher Cu contents of the primary magma 8 .
Averages of median Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot values at 4 - 6 wt % MgO are also significantly correlated for the 23 arcs ( Fig . 2c ) .
Magmatic H 2 O contents and fO 2 play a prominent role in the development of tholeiitic versus calc - alkaline trends [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 18 : high water contents and fO 2 lead to calc - alkaline trends through suppression of plagioclase fractionation and promotion of early magnetite and amphibole fractionation 4 , 6 .
Copper saturation in magmas is intimately bound to the onset of magnetite crystallization 23 , which induces sulphide saturation and consequent Cu sequestration into either a fluid 24 or , more likely , a sulphide melt 25 , 26 .
The ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc carried by magmas in thin arcs correspond to the theoretic average global Cu flux through arcs ( Supplementary Table 5 ) , suggesting that in thin arcs Cu is quantitatively carried by magmas .
A simple fractional crystallization model using MELTS , a software package for modelling phase equilibria in magmatic systems ( refs 21 , 22 ) , reproduces the observed Fe 2 O 3tot - MgO trends by varying H 2 O contents ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ) .
I find that magmas of thicker arcs are systematically more calc - alkaline and more depleted copper than magmas of thinner arcs .
As far as the water content effect on the calc - alkaline trend is concerned , this correlation is better accounted for by the fact that magmatic evolution occurs on average at deeper crustal levels in thick arcs compared with thin arcs 17 , 19 .
In contrast , arc magmas evolving in thicker crust start to lose Cu early because of early magnetite crystallization , which also produces a calc - alkaline trend therein ( Fig . 1a , b ) .
The formation of calc - alkaline magmas is favoured by high water content and oxygen fugacity 4 - 7 .
The differential Cu evolution in thin ( tholeiitic ) and thick ( calc - alkaline ) arcs implies that magmatic products in thin arcs carry on average ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc , whereas those in thick arcs carry on average only 4 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc ( Supplementary Table 4 and Fig . 2 ) .
Figure 2b shows that the thicker the arc crust the more calc - alkaline magmas ( see also refs 16 , 17 ) .
The authors inferred that the Cu lost by evolving arc magmas is sequestered by sulphide phases in the lower crust .
These characteristics , as well as magmatic metal contents , are thought to be imparted in the mantle source by fluids of the subducted slab 8 - 10 .
The global scale correlations among arc crustal thickness , Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot have important implications for the understanding of firstorder factors controlling the development of calc - alkaline versus tholeiitic trends and Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas .
The results presented here suggest that larger amounts of Cu can be concentrated within or at the base of the crust of thicker arc segments and may provide a consistent explanation to why porphyry copper systems form preferentially ( although not exclusively ) in thick arcs in association with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
8 ) , recent studies 14 , 15 suggest that the oxidation state of the subarc mantle is not significantly different from that of the mantle under ocean ridges and that Cu contents of the primitive magmas generated in these two contexts are similar 11 .
The above arguments suggest that the processes of Cu depletion in arc magmas , which may ultimately play an important role in the Cu deficit of the continental crust and in the formation of porphyry copper deposits 11 , are controlled by the upper plate .
Nonetheless , as shown by the heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of porphyry - type deposits also within thick arcs 12 , only a special combination of regional to local scale conditions 28 will ultimately allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems within the generally favourable environment of thick arcs .
Hypogene sulfide mineralization principally occurred within the potassic , transitional potassic–phyllic and phyllic alteration zones as disseminations , stockwork veinlets and open - space fillings .
Hydrothermal fluids derived from the crystallization of the quartz monzonite porphyry stock and its subsequent boiling events – inferred from the banded texture in quartz - sulfide veins indicating multiple re - opening and sealing occurrences , as well as the results of fluid inclusion study carried out by Simmonds et al . ( 2015 ) , which will be discussed in the next section – caused rupturing and hydro - fracturing within the cupola zone of the stock and led to the development of the mineralized stockwork and associated alteration zones reported in the Kighal area .
Zircon U–Pb ages for quartz - monzonite porphyry stock in Kighal indicate that magma crystallization occurred in the early Miocene between 20 . 0 ± 0 . 2 and 18 . 8 ± 0 . 2 Ma ( Fig . 8 ) .
Sphalerite and galena are mainly present in marginal parts of the porphyry stock , occurring within the quartz–sulfide and carbonate– sulfide veinlets .
The quartz monzonite porphyry stock at Kighal is one of the numerous Cenozoic intrusions in this zone , located ~ 12 km north of the city of Varzeghan .
The Kighal porphyry stock is therefore slightly younger than the porphyry stock and mineralization at Sungun , for which zircon U–Pb ages of porphyritic quartz - monzonite 22 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 stock range from 22 . 1 ± 0 . 5 Ma to 20 . 1 ± 0 . 4 Ma ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ) , whereas molybdenite Re–Os dating yielded ages between 22 . 9 ± 0 . 2 and 21 . 7 ± 0 . 2 Ma ( Simmonds et al . , 2017 ) .
Such wide ranges salinities and homogenization temperatures were also reported by many workers from typical PCDs throughout the world ( e . g . , Etminan , 1978 ; Wilkinson , 2001 ; Gonzalez - Partida and Levresse , 2003 ; Calagari , 2004b ) .
These hypogene minerals include pyrite , chalcopyrite and molybdenite , along with lesser amounts of sphalerite and galena at the marginal parts of the porphyry stock .
Further petrographic and microthermometric evidence such as the occurrence of two - phase and multiphase inclusions homogenizing over the same temperature range , as well as systematic distribution of the densities of liquid - and vapor - rich two - phase inclusions testify to the occurrence of liquid - vapor immiscibility ( boiling ) and separation of a high - salinity liquid phase from a low - salinity vapor - rich phase .
Moreover , mineralization of sphalerite and galena also took place at the marginal parts of the porphyry stock .
Moreover , metal fractionation occurs during the fluid immiscibility , and a significant fraction of Cu and Mo was transported by the vapor phase .
Meanwhile , fluid neutralization 20 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 by wall - rock reaction appears to be the main driving force for Zn deposition in more distal portions of the porphyry system ( Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ) , which is also evident at Kighal .
After that the porphyry stock was exposed to surface weathering processes with development of an oxidized and leached zone above the existing ground water table and a supergene sulfide blanket in phreatic zone , leading to ore enrichment represented by the replacement of supergene sulfide minerals .
The relatively high fO2 during the potassic alteration is inferred 18 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 from the precipitation of hypogene magnetite and hematite in this zone , while the acidic nature of the hydrothermal fluids is inferable from the widespread occurrence of phyllic alteration , for which feldspars are replaced by sericite under low pH conditions and following the decrease in temperature and a ( K + ) / a ( H + ) of the fluids ( compared to the potassic alteration ; Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) through hydrolysis ( and K + metasomatism in the case of plagioclase ) ( e . g . , Montoya and Hemley , 1975 ) .
Intrusion of the first generation of quartz–dioritic dikes ( qd1 ) probably occurred during this stage , which are weakly to moderately sericitized , containing some euhedral pyrite crystals but no copper sulfides .
4 . 1 Sequence of the hydrothermal events Zircon U–Pb age data constrain the crystallization of the sub - volcanic quartz monzonite porphyry stock at Kighal to the early Miocene .
Moreover , the salinity of fluid inclusions ranges from 1 . 4 to 70 wt % NaCl eq .
Following the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids and changes in their physico - chemical characteristics ( discussed in the next section ) , phyllic alteration zones were developed in the Kighal porphyry system .
Similarly , the wide range of bulk density values in coexisting set of inclusions testifies to entrapment from heterogeneous boiling fluids during multiple events of phase immiscibility .
This age corresponds to the third magmatic and mineralization epoch of porphyry copper deposits and prospects in northwestern Iran ( Simmonds et al . , 2017 ) and shows an overlap with the mineralization age in the Masjed Daghi PCD and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , while it is slightly younger than the porphyritic quartz - monzonite stock in Sungun PCD and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Niaz porphyry Cu prospect .
These magmatic events brought about Cu–Mo porphyry deposits and prospects ( e . g . , world - class Kadjaran and Agarak on the Armenian side and Sungun and Haft Cheshmeh on the Iranian side ) and spatially associated precious metal epithermal occurrences in both areas ( Moritz et al . , 2016b ) .
4 . 4 Temporal relationship between the Kighal porphyry stock and the neighboring intrusive bodies and porphyry host stocks In general , porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Iran are predominantly located along the UDMA , including the Ahar–Jolfa , Central Iran and Kerman metallogenic zones ( Fig . 1 ) .
By taking into account the development of hydrothermal alteration zones and their spatial distribution , stockwork - type mineralization of Cu–Mo minerals , and even the occurrence of mineralization zoning with Cu–Mo - rich ore within the stock and Cu–Pb–Zn ore in the marginal parts , mineralization at Kighal in association with the quartz monzonite sub - volcanic stock can be regarded as of porphyry copper type .
Adamia et al . ( 1981 , 2011 ) include the South Armenia terrane together with the Sanandaj– Sirjan zone into the Central Iranian platform since the Jurassic , an interpretation which is shared by Golonka ( 2004 ) and Alavi ( 2007 ) .
This led to the instability and breakdown of metal transporting complexes and consequently to metal deposition .
Taking into account the published ages for the PCDs and prospects in Ahar–Jolfa zone , Simmonds et al . ( 2017 ) proposed three epochs of magmatic - hydrothermal activities associated with porphyry Cu mineralization , including the late Eocene with the Saheb Divan PCD , the middle Oligocene associated with the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , Siah Kamar porphyry Mo deposit and the vein - type porphyry - like Cu–Mo–Au mineralization in the Qarachilar area , and the early Miocene characterized by the formation of Sungun , Masjed Daghi and Niaz PCDs and prospects ( Fig . 10 ) .
Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) stated that the majority of porphyry copper deposits , which contain magnetite , either without sulfides or as part of ore - grade assemblages of bornite and / or chalcopyrite , as well as those with the dominance of pyrite + chalcopyrite in the ore zone , are of intermediate sulfidation state .
The age data show that it is a little younger than the quartz - monzonite porphyry stock in the Sungun porphyry copper deposit ( PCD ) and the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Niaz prospect , while it is almost coeval with the porphyritic granodiorite stock in the Haft Cheshmeh PCD , as well as with the mineralization at the Masjed Daghi PCD in NW Iran .
The late stage is barren , characterized by the formation of late quartz , calcite and anhydrite–gypsum veinlets , along with minor amounts of sulfide minerals , though pyrite is still the dominant sulfide phase .
It can be concluded that the principal process resulting in the deposition of ore minerals ( especially the stockwork mineralization ) in the studied area was boiling of the hydrothermal fluids ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) during which , acidic volatiles escaped through the resulted hydro - fractures inducing a pH increase ( Barnes , 1979 ) , accompanied by rapid cooling of the fluids due to the abrupt pressure lifting .
However , these ages overlap within uncertainties with the youngest magmatic event in the MOP , corresponding to the emplacement of the early Miocene adakitic high - K calc - alkaline porphyritic granodioritic intrusions and dikes dated between 22 . 8 ± 0 . 5 Ma and 21 . 2 ± 0 . 3 Ma in the Kadjaran mining area ( Moritz et al . , 2016 ; Rezeau et al . , 2016 ) .
Three distinct and separate populations of fluid inclusions were recognized in the salinity vs . TH ( L - V ) plot ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) : high salinity ( halite - bearing ) with wide range of TH ( L - V ) , moderate salinity and low - salinity ( two - phase ) with relatively narrow TH ( L - V ) ranges .
It must be acknowledged that these two early stages were responsible for most of the mineralization discovered at Kighal .
These data are also in the range of those 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 from the MOP ( median initial εHf values between 8 . 0 and 11 . 3 ) reported by Rezeau et al . ( 2016 ) .
However , its low Cu and Mo grade detracts its economic potential . 1 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 Zircon U–Pb geochronology of the porphyry stock yielded Early Miocene ages of 20 . 0 ± 0 . 2 to 18 . 8 ± 0 . 2 Ma with a weighted mean of 19 . 24 ± 0 . 17 Ma , which correspond to the third porphyry Cu metallogenic epoch in NW Iran .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .
The composite metallogenic system was dominantly characterized by the multi - episodic and diverse mineralization concomitant with one or more features including mineralization evolved from the previous metal enrichment , later overlap of ore deposit , and diversifying of metal species derived from 2 GR Focus Review reworked lithosphere .

Biotite and muscovite Ar - Ar thermochronology of mylonitic gneiss from Sulu belt suggest that the UHP metamorphic rocks started to exhume at ~ 220 - 200 Ma ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .

The Cu - Mo carrying granitoids generated at ~ 15 Ma in the same location show large zircon εHf ( t ) variation from elevated positive values to largely negative ones which concentrated mostly at 10 to −5 , suggesting a juvenile crustdominated source with involvement of older lower crust materials ( Fig . 13 ) .
The Sanjiang orogenic belt experienced Proto - , Paleo - , Meso - Tethyan evolution and the subsequent oblique continental collision ( Deng et al . , 2014a ( Deng et al . , , 2014b .
The Mesozoic and early - Cenozoic evolution of the Baoshan and Tengchong blocks was largely influenced by eastward oceanic subduction of the Meso - and Neo - Tethys from late - Permian to middle - Cretaceous and from late - Cretaceous to ~ 50 Ma , respectively ( Fig . 15 ) ( Xu et al . , 2012 ; Xie et al . , 2016 ) .
The molybdenite Re - Os age of the Tongchanggou deposit is 88 - 82 Ma ( Li et al . , 2012c ; Yang et al . , 2016b ) and that of the Hongshan deposit is 77 ± 2 Ma ( Xu et al . , 2006a ) , which are similar to the zircon U - Pb age of 81 . 1 ± 0 . 5 Ma for the associated porphyry bodies ( Wang et al . , 2011a ) .

The orebodies of auriferous quartz vein and wall rock alteration occur in NNW - striking fracture zones hosted by weakly metamorphosed turbidite of the Lower Silurian age .
The markedly low rhenium contents ( 4 . 9 to 13 . 0 × 10 −3 ppm ) in molybdenite from the deposit suggest that the ore was derived from a crustal source ( Guo et al . , 2013 ) .
The E - W - trending Middle - Lower Yangtze Valley metallogenic belt , located in the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton ( Fig . 16 ) , hosts two major types of ore deposits : porphyry - skarn - stratabound Cu - Au - Mo - Fe deposits with an age range of 137 - 143 Ma and apatite - magnetite ( or magnetite porphyry ) deposits with ages of 125 - 123 Ma ( Mao et al . , 2006 , Mao et al . , 2011b .
The granites show bulk rock εNd ( t ) values in the range of - 12 . 2 to - 10 . 8 and zircon εHf ( t ) values from − 15 . 5 to − 2 . 5 , with Meso - Paleoproterozoic T DM C ages for both Nd and Hf isotopes .
The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction of Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The regional lithospheric extension may have been the driving force for generation and emplacement of the mafic / crust derived magmas , which induced partial melting overlying crustal materials to produce felsic magmas ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) .
The zircon εHf ( t ) values and whole - rock Sr / Y ratios concentrated at 100 - 10 of the Dexing metallogenic granites suggests that the magma was derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust , formed through thickened lithospheric mantle delamination intracontinental setting Wang et al . , 2015b ) .
The Tibetan region was affected by the accretionary orogenesis from Proto - , Paleo - , Meso - Tethyan consumption ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) with normal continental collision initiated from ~ 55 Ma ( Figs . 4 , 12 , and 25 ) .
The superimposed orogeny is best exemplified by the Tibet orogenic belts , which comprise blocks separated from Gondwana through the opening of Paleo - , Meso - , and Neo - Tethyan oceans ( Fig . 5 ) .
The blocks were located along the Gondwana margin from Cambrian to Ordovician , and they experienced subduction of Proto - Tethyan Ocean resulting in the long - lasting magmatism within the blocks .
The shearing disaggregated the ophiolite forming mélange zone , and the magmatism developed along the Tethyan or even earlier subduction zones developed with subduction - related igneous rocks .
The ancient sutures between blocks , craton margins , and arcs acted as favorable locations for the production of ore deposit during the later tectonic events ( Fig . 18 ) .
The reactivation ancient deep faults or syn - depositional faults formed in the previous tectonic regimes was favorable for the transportation of metal - carrying magmas and fluids .
The preliminary metal enrichment magmatic rocks erosion provides favorable fundamental setting for the later metallogenesis .
The different sources proportions of magma mixing yielded three potential sources that caused a large variation in the metal species and their combinations .
The lithospheric stacking crustal thickening could have occurred simultaneously with the formation of the juvenile lower crust which evolved from the mantle .
The reactivation arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal , eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) . Precursor subduction - related magmatism is important because such processes leave ore - metal enriched residue in cumulate zones within the juvenile crust , which can be re - mobilized during later partial melting .
The partial melts from juvenile crust will be hydrous and oxidized , and will therefore have the potential to form magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits in the upper crustal levels .
The melt generated from the metasomatized mantle was considered to partly trigger the crustal melting and mix with the crust - derived magma ( Deng et al . , 2010b ( Deng et al . , , 2015a .
The transition of tectonic regime within the same tectonic unit over a long period of time result in the re - mobilization and superposition of same ore deposit ( Zhai et al . , 2009 ) . In the Bayan Obo super - large REE ore deposit , located in the northern margin of North China Craton ( Fig . 8 ) , the REE - Nb - Fe orebodies were produced in related to the intrusion Mo - Sn porphyry skarn orebodies underneath the Carboniferous stratiform orebodies at a deposit - scale ( Fig . 22 ) .

It is proposed that the Ge was leached from underneath Ge - rich Lincang granites via circulating hydrothermal fluids .
This suggests that these Cu - carrying magmas were sourced from the melting of depleted mantle or subducting oceanic crust .
It is suggested that the Mo - Cu metallogenic magma was derived from the juvenile crust formed during the oceanic subduction at ~ 230 - 220 Ma with involvement of the ancient lower crust materials .
In the former case , the ore fluid was composed of both basinal brine and magmatic hydrothermal , which take different percentage fluid ( Tao et al . , 2011 ) ; and in the later , the fluid components include metamorphic fluid and basinal brine , and these two kinds of fluid both formed independent ore deposit and participated in the same deposit ( Deng et al , 2016c ) .

The earlier to later phase of granites high K calc - alkaline and shoshonitic series , and the associated metal species changed from Cu - dominant to Mo - dominant .
It is thus concluded that the ancient lower crust has contributed Mo into the parental magma , and the involvement of mantle or juvenile crust melt induced complex metal associations and lowered A / CNK values .
Based on the recent extensive geochronological data constraining the timing of ductile shearing and the emplacement of ( ultra - ) potassic rocks , it has been recognized that the ductile shearing postdated the magmatism ( Lu et al . , 2012 ( Lu et al . , , 2013a .

Porphyry Cu systems were generated worldwide since the Archean , although Meso - Cenozoic examples are most abundantly preserved ( e . g . , Singer et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) , probably because younger arc terranes are normally the least eroded ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Kesler and Wilkinson , 2006 ; Wilkinson and Kesler , 2009 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .
Typical hypogene porphyry Cu deposits have average grades of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent Cu , < 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 percent Mo , and 0 . 0× to 1 . 5 g / t Au , although a few " Auonly " deposits have Au tenors of 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 g / t but little Cu ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Individual porphyry Cu belts are commonly spatially separate rather than superimposed on one another , reflecting arc migration as a result of steepening or shallowing of subducted slabs between the individual magmatic - metallogenic epochs ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Faults and fault intersections are invariably involved , to greater or lesser degrees , in determining the formational sites and geometries of porphyry Cu systems and their constituent parts .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline or , less commonly , alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may be similarly blind , beneath a thick limestone sequence in the case of Pueblo Viejo .
Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .
Mo - rich porphyry Cu deposits are normally tied to the more felsic intrusions , whereas Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits tend to be related to the more mafic end members , although intrusions as felsic as quartz monzonite may also host Au - rich examples ( e . g . , Mamut , East Malaysia ; Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ) .
The breccia clasts may be set in rock - flour matrix , hydrothermal cement , fine - grained igneous material , or some combination of the three .
Phreatic breccias , as exemplified by pebble dikes , normally contain polymictic clast populations set in muddy , rock - flour matrices ( Table 1 ) .
Alteration - mineralization zoning in porphyry Cu deposits
Sericitic alteration tends to be more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits , whereas chlorite - sericite alteration develops preferentially in porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Sodic - calcic alteration , commonly magnetite bearing ( Table 2 ) , is normally rather poorly preserved at depth porphyry Cu deposits , commonly in the immediate wall rocks to the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Panguna , Papua New Guinea and El Teniente ; Ford , 1978 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , a position that may give rise to confusion with propylitic alteration ( Fig . 10 ) .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .
Absence anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components of many ledges .
Peripheral veins cutting propylitic halos may also be Au rich , and at Mineral Park an outward zoning from Pb - Zn to Au - Ag is evident ( Eidel et al . , 1968 ; Lang and Eastoe , 1988 ; Fig . 9b ) .
Magma and fluid production
The shallow - level porphyry stocks do not themselves generate the bulk of the magmatic fluid volume , but simply act as " exhaust valves , " conduits for its upward transmission from the parental chambers , perhaps via cupolas on their roofs ( Fig . 4 ) .
The single - phase liquid , the mineralizer in deeply formed porphyry Cu deposits , may generate the relatively uncommon EDM halo veinlets ( Rusk et al . , 2008a ; Proffett , 2009 ) , whereas the two - phase fluid produces the more common A - and B - type quartz veinlets ( e . g . , Roedder , 1984 , and references therein ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal brecciation may be triggered by sudden release of fluid overpressures caused by roof failure above large , expanding vapor bubbles ( Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; Burnham , 1985 ) , particularly near the ductile - brittle transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10× dilution hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .
High Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts where porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms are overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive , thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .
Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .
Thermal regimes that permit vertically extensive ore zone development in potassic zones commonly have greater size potential than those that were excessively hot internally , thereby inhibiting sulfide precipitation and giving rise to large lowgrade or barren cores ; the exception is where the resultant shell - like orebodies are areally extensive and thick ( e . g . , Bingham and Resolution ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are arguably the most studied and potentially best known and understood ore deposit type ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , and their relationships with the skarn environment have been appreciated for many years ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
The pebble dikes and related breccias are chiefly restricted to porphyry Cu deposits , including their marginal parts , whereas brecciation induced by the fluid confinement typifies the overlying highsulfidation epithermal environment ( Fig . 6 ) .
The upper parts of porphyry Cu systems , mainly at shallower levels than their porphyry intrusions , are characterized by lithocaps : lithologically controlled zones of pervasive advanced argillic alteration with structurally controlled components , including their subvertical root zones ( Figs . 4 , 6 , 10 ; Table 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700° to 550 °C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .
The low - salinity liquid , whose ascent is controlled by the preexisting quartz veinlet stockworks , synmineral faults , and permeability contrasts provided by steep intrusive contacts , appears to be responsible for the progressive formation of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic alteration , as well as continued advanced argillic alteration and the principal Cu and Au mineralization in the overlying lithocaps Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Rusk et al . , 2008b ) .
If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps quartz - pyrophyllite ± muscovite ± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .
The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz - bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them .
Each belt corresponds to a magmatic arc of broadly similar overall dimensions .
The volcanic sequence is a stratovolcano ( but could just as readily be a dome complex ; Fig . 6 ) and has been partly eroded prior to porphyry Cu formation .
The earlier porphyry bodies are not destroyed when intruded by later phases but merely split apart , causing overall inflation of the rock package as would occur during ordinary dike emplacement .
The porphyry phases in some individual deposits may have clear compositional differences ( e . g . , Bajo de la Alumbrera ; Proffett , 2003 ) and / or characteristic igneous textures ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) ; however , particularly in many porphyry Au and Cu - Au deposits , the different phases are commonly only subtly different or nearly identical .
The diatremes , particularly their contact zones , may localize part of the high - sulfidation Au mineralization ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu , Papua New Guinea ; Fig . 6 ) .
the magmatic - hydrothermal breccias and pebble dikes at the porphyry Cu level , these phreatic breccias in the high - sulfidation environment may attain the paleosurface , where hydrothermal eruptions result in subaerial breccia accumulation as aprons around the eruptive vents ( e . g . , Hedenquist and Henley , 1985 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The chalcopyrite ± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) , with one or more bornite - rich centers characterizing the deeper , central parts many deposits .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .
The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low ( e . g . , quartz sandstone , felsic igneous rocks ) rather than high acid - buffering capacities .
The veinlet sequence in porphyry Cu deposits , first elaborated by Gustafson and Hunt ( 1975 ) at El Salvador and widely studied since ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ; Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) , is highly distinctive .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers of both translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage , nearly monomineralic veinlets .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
The Cu ± Mo ± Au cores typically have kilometer - scale halos defined by anomalous Zn , Pb values that reflect lower temperature , hydrothermal conditions ( Fig . 9a , b ) .
Any carbonate rocks affected by the lithocap environment may be particularly receptive .
Many porphyry Cu deposits are formed as vertically extensive bodies , which become progressively lower grade both outward and downward , whereas others have a bell - or cap - like form because little Cu was precipitated internally at depth ( e . g . , Resolution ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
These phreatic breccias host ore in many high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu deposits ( e . g . , Choquelimpie , northern Chile ; Gröpper et al . , 1991 ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ºC ) of silica deposition .
These pressure variations may induce changes in the fluid phases present and consequent remobilization as well as precipitation of metals ( e . g . , Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu ± Au ± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
As the thermal regimes of porphyry Cu systems decay , shallowly generated alteration - mineralization types become telescoped over more deeply formed ones ( e . g . , Gustafson , 1978 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) , thereby causing the sequence of metal remobilization and reprecipitation events emphasized above .
There , Cu ± Mo ± Au characterize the potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic cores of systems .
In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .
Although Cu and / or Au tenors of the former potassic zones may undergo depletion during the chlorite - sericite overprints ( e . g . , Esperanza , northern Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) , metal introduction is also widely recognized ( e . g . , Leach , 1999 ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) and , at a few deposits , is considered to account for much of the contained Cu ( e . g . , Cerro Colorado , northern Chile ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .
The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .
The same liquid continues upward into the lithocap where , upon cooling in an unbuffered environment , it evolves into a high sulfidation - state liquid ; if properly focused , it may generate high - sulfidation ( HS ) epithermal deposits .
Note that subvolcanic basement rocks host much of the porphyry Cu deposit on the left , whereas that on the right is mainly enclosed by two phases of the precursor pluton .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K ± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , effects that are accompanied by downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Unusually large , laterally extensive proximal skarn bodies may form preferentially where suitable carbonate host rocks abut the tops of porphyry stocks ( e . g . , Antamina ; Redwood , 2004 ) .
Along with calc - alkaline batholiths and volcanic chains , they are the hallmarks of magmatic arcs constructed above active subduction zones at convergent plate margins ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ) , although a minority of such systems occupies postcollisional and other tectonic settings that develop after subduction ceases ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .
Changes in crustal stress regime are considered by some as especially favorable times for porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposit generation ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) , with Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera , Argentina , for example , both apparently occupying such a tectonic niche ( Presnell , 1997 ; Sasso and Clark , 1998 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
There , it condenses into ground water to oxidize and produce the low - temperature , acidic fluid responsible for the blanketlike , advanced argillic alteration zones characteristic of the steam - heated environment ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
Diatremes , upward - flared volcanic vents generated mainly by phreatomagmatic eruptive activity , are widespread in porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1985 ) , including their shallow , epithermal parts ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Addition of mafic melt to the parental chambers could be an effective means of augmenting S and metal budgets Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Maughan et al . , 2002 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Similarly , proximal skarns lacking hydrous , retrograde overprints are unlikely to host significant Cu - Au deposits .
Injection of fine - grained , igneous matrix defines the igneous breccia near the base of the body .
In contrast , D - type veinlets may be up to 1 km laterally away from the target .
However , the erosion involved in the unroofing porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .
However , the patches may also comprise alunite or kaolinite , suggesting that the texture may result by either preferential nucleation of any common advanced argillic mineral or even advanced argillic overprinting of a nucleation texture developed during earlier potassic or chlorite - sericite alteration of fragmental rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 , and Caspiche ) .
In contrast , Mo may be transported as different , possibly oxochloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( Ulrich and Mavrogenes , 2008 ) .
The resultant telescoping is potentially more extreme , giving rise to deep penetration of advanced argillic alteration into porphyry stocks , where porphyry Cu systems undergo either rapid , synhydrothermal erosion under high uplift , pluvial or glacial conditions ( Fig . 14 ) or , perhaps less commonly , gravity - induced sector collapse of any overlying volcanic edifices ( Sillitoe , 1994 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Landtwing et al . , 2002 ; Carman , 2003 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the El Indio and Yanacocha high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga and Cajamarca - Huaraz belts , respectively .
Although many hydrothermal breccias , like the late diatremes mentioned above , are commonly diluents to ore , some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias give rise to anomalously highgrade rock volumes despite their intermineral timing .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .
In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous , retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .
Apart from the massive enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched in Na , K , and Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Cooling of the hypersaline liquid in contact with external wall rocks and dilution with meteoric water in the propylitic halos may be the main causes of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn precipitation ( Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) , giving rise to the geochemical halos of these metals and , in some systems , localized vein concentrations ( Jerome , 1966 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
The size of the stocks does not appear to bear any obvious relationship to the size of the associated porphyry Cu deposits and their Cu contents ( cf .
Each individual deposit or prospect must be carefully constructed using surface mapping and core logging , with particular attention paid to the temporal as well as spatial relationships of its constituent parts .
Several types of phreatic ( meteoric - hydrothermal ) breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .
younger than the potassic zone that it overprints ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Padilla - Garza et al . , 2004 ) , reflecting the time needed for the telescoping to take place .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .
The forms of many porphyry Cu deposits mimic those of their host intrusions ; thus , cylindrical stocks typically host cylindrical orebodies ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas laterally extensive dikes give rise to orebodies with similar narrow , elongate shapes ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
Once formed , the quartz - bearing veinlets are permanent features that are not erased during subsequent alteration overprinting , although their metal contents may be wholly or partially removed ( see above ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma convection ceases , there are marked reductions aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H . SILLITOE 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 6 and 10 to show the evolution of the main magmatic fluid and alteration - mineralization types in concert with progressive downward magma solidification , cooling , and paleosurface degradation .
( 6 ) why do some porphyry Cu deposits develop large and high - grade magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , whereas others have only minor examples or none at all ?
The pro - gressive thermal decline of the systems combined with synmineral paleosurface degradation results in the char - acteristic overprinting ( telescoping ) and partial to total reconstitution of older by younger alteration - mineral - ization types .
Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .
In contrast , large high - sulfidation deposits average 1 to 3 g / t Au but have only minor or no recoverable Cu , commonly as a result of supergene removal .
Large parts of many porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Titley , 1982 ) , especially deeply formed ( e . g . , Butte ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008a or relatively deeply eroded examples like El Abra ( Ambrus , 1977 ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) and Gaby ( Gabriela Mistral ) , northern Chile ( Camus , 2001 ( Camus , , 2003 , are made up predominantly of potassic alteration , which grades marginally into generally weakly developed propylitic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
( 8 ) what controls metal depletion versus enrichment during chlorite - sericite and sericitic overprints ?
Much of the metal in many porphyry Cu deposits is contained in the quartz - dominated , group 2 veinlets and as disseminated grains in the intervening potassic - altered rocks , although some of the late , group 3 quartz - sulfide veins and their wall rocks may also be important contributors .
Elsewhere , however , lower temperature quartz - kaolinite is the dominant overprint assemblage ( e . g . , Caspiche , northern Chile ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric but possibly containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .
Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .
However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .
The large size of some porphyry Cu systems , with maximum radii of ~ 8 km ( e . g . , Fig . 9 ) and maximum areal extents approaching 100 km 2 ( Singer et al . , 2008 ) , complicates their effective exploration because attention is unavoidably focused on the more prominently altered parts , such as pyrite - bearing porphyry Cu mineralization , pyrite halos , and pyrite - rich lithocaps .
At the district scale , porphyry Cu systems and their contained deposits tend to occur as clusters or alignments that may attain 5 to 30 km across or in length , respectively .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .
There , distinction from phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias may be difficult because of texture obliteration caused by intense advanced argillic alteration ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ) .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Lateral transfer of such liquids beyond lithocaps to form intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits is also dependent on the existence of suitable permeability , which in a few cases is the direct continuation of that utilized by the contiguous high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Colquijirca , Tintic ) .
In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au ± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .
They are distinguished from the phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias by several features ( Table 1 ) , particularly the absence of tuffaceous material .
The existence of even minor erosional remnants of steam - heated horizons and their chalcedonic bases , generated above and at paleowater tables , respectively , guarantees that the appropriate near - surface level is preserved ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
The main development of these bornite bearing , high - sulfidation assemblages is largely confined to white sericitic alteration that overprints now - barren quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
Spatial relationships between porphyry Cu stocks , underlying pluton , overlying comagmatic volcanic rocks , and the lithocap .
High water contents result in magmas becoming saturated with the aqueous phase , into which the ore metals can partition efficiently ; and high oxidation state suppresses magmatic sulfide , such as pyrrhotite , precipitation , a process that may cause sequestration of metals before they can partition into the aqueous phase .
a . Bingham , Utah , where the porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposit is followed successively outward by Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and distal sediment - hosted Au deposits , the latter formerly exploited at Barneys Canyon and Melco ( after Babcock et al . , 1995 ) .
A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) .
Notwithstanding the ubiquity of porphyry Cu belts , major deposits may also occur in isolation or at least as distant outliers of coherent belts and provinces ( e . g . , Pebble in Alaska , Butte in Montana , and Bingham in Utah ; Sillitoe , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .
Narrow , mineralogically complex quartz - sericite - K - feldspar - biotite veinlets with centimeterscale halos defined by the same minerals ( ± andalusite ± corundum ) along with abundant , finely disseminated chalcopyrite ± bornite characterize the changeover from group 1 to 2 veinlets in a few deposits , although they may have been confused elsewhere with D - type veinlets because of their eye - catching halos ; they are termed early dark micaceous halo veinlets at Butte ( Meyer , 1965 ; Brimhall , 1977 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) and Bingham ( Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and type 4 ( T4 ) veinlets at Los Pelambres ( Atkinson et al . , 1996 ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity veining , alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
The empirical relationship between well - established magmatic ( including postcollisional ) arcs containing major , highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits and contractional tectonic settings characterized by high surface uplift and denudation rates ( see above ) may prove to be a useful criterion for selection of underexplored arc segments with incompletely tested potential . Contractional settings are strongly suggested where entire arc segments possess only minor volcanic rock volumes contemporaneous with the development of porphyry Cu systems , particularly where lithocaps are widely preserved as evidence for shallow erosion .
The alteration - mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren , early sodic - calcic through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic , to advanced argillic , the last of these constituting the lithocaps , which may attain > 1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion .
It also needs to be emphasized that few porphyry Cu systems , whatever their exposure level , contain the full spectrum of potential ore types depicted in Figure 6 , although the Bingham district with its porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and sediment - hosted Au deposits ( Babcock et al . , 1995 ) and the more shallowly exposed Lepanto district with its porphyry Cu - Au , high - sulfidation Cu - Au - Ag , and intermediate - sulfidation Au - Ag - Cu deposits ( Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) are exceptionally well endowed in this regard .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper saline vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper - saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .
The largest concentrations of peripheral Zn , Pb , and Ag are confined to systems carbonate rocks , where fluid neutralization induces the precipitation of these metals in skarn and carbonate - replacement deposits ( Seward and Barnes , 1997 ) .
The main geochemical difference between the Cu - Au zones in porphyry Cu deposits and those in the overlying lithocaps is the elevated As ( ± Sb ) contents consequent upon the abundance of the Cu sulfosalts in the latter .
The fluid most likely to lead to appreciable high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu mineralization in the relatively barren , earlyformed lithocaps is the low - to moderate - salinity , H 2 S - rich , aqueous liquid that produces the underlying sericitic zones Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Locally , early A - type veinlets displaying aplitic centers or along - strike transitions to aplite and / or aplite porphyry ( vein dikes ) are observed ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Heithersay et al . , 1990 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
These transverse features , possibly reflecting underlying basement structures , may facilitate ascent of the relatively small magma volumes involved in porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , Clark , 1993 ; Richards , 2000 ) .
Open - space filling is also uncommon , except in phreatic breccias and unusual , isolated veins ( e . g . , La Mejicana alunite - pyrite - famatinite vein at Nevados del Famatina ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) .
The same situation is also apparent in several giant high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits generated in thickened crust during tectonic uplift , such as Pascua - Lama Veladero northern Chile Argentina , where the near absence of contemporaneous volcanism is more certain ( Bissig et al . , 2001 ; Charchaflié et al . , 2007 ) given the much shallower erosion level , including partial paleosurface preservation ( see below ) .
( 9 ) what are the main mechanisms controlling the bulk Cu / Au / Mo ratios of porphyry Cu deposits ?
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that certain lithologic units may enhance grade development in both porphyry Cu and related deposit types .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high temperatures and oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .
Furthermore , there seems to be no obvious relationship between the size of porphyry Cu deposits and the duration of the intrusive activity , the latter seemingly being the main parameter defining the total hydrothermal life spans of porphyry Cu systems .
Isotopic dating , using the U - Pb zircon method , suggests that the multiphase porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu systems can be assembled in as little as 80 , 000 years ( Batu Hijau , Indonesia ; Garwin , 2002 ) , but the process commonly takes much longer .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .
However , at the shallower depths typical of most deposits ( < ~ 4 km ) , the mineralization is introduced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction of hypersaline liquid ( brine ) and a much larger volume of lowdensity vapor ( Fournier , 1999 ) , produced by either direct exsolution from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more typically , as the single - phase liquid decompresses cools intersects its solvus ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Cline , 1995 ) .
Furthermore , the current geologic knowledge base permits meaningful deployment of sophisticated geochemical and geophysical techniques in some exploration programs ( e . g . , Kelley et al . , 2006 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) .
Some investigators emphasize the importance of intersections between continentscale transverse fault zones or lineaments and arc - parallel structures for porphyry Cu formation , with the Archibarca and Calama - El Toro lineaments of northern Chile ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 2 ) , the Lachlan Transverse Zone of New South Wales ( Glen and Walshe , 1999 ) , comparable features in New Guinea ( Corbett , 1994 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , and the much wider ( 160 km ) Texas lineament of southwestern North America ( Schmitt , 1966 ) being oft - quoted examples .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late crystalline veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .
range from restricted veneers near the stock or dike contacts to kilometer - scale zones , such as those in the mafic host lithologic units mentioned previously at El Teniente , Resolution , and Oyu Tolgoi .
The Bingham , Island Copper , and Agua Rica , Argentina , porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are exceptions to this generalization because of their deep , centrally located molybdenite zones ( John , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995Perelló et al . , , 1998 .
For example , the 12 . 5 - Gt resource at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic is confined to the 14 - km - long stock referred to above ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Camus , 2003 ) , whereas perhaps only roughly 20 percent of the similarly sized El Teniente deposit and < 10 percent of the 1 . 5 - Gt El Abra deposit are hosted by the porphyry intrusions ( Camus , 1975 ( Camus , , 2003Ambrus , 1977 ) .
Concentrations of chalcophile and siderophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance of residual sulfide phases in the mantle source .
Concentrations of chalcophile and siderophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance residual sulfide phases mantle source .
Small amounts chalcophile and siderophile element - rich sulfides may also be left in these cumulates .
Alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits are an extreme end - member of this range of post - subduction deposits , formed from subduction - modified mantle sources in extensional or transtensional environments .

Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .
Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Sediment melting in subduction zones
Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .
Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .
Associated magmas are typically calcalkaline , but tend towards somewhat more alkaline compositions compared with normal arc magmas ( Richards , 2009 ) .
Xenoliths from supra - subduction zone mantle ( McInnes et al . , 1999 ) and samples of mafic cumulates from lower crustal arc roots ( Fig . 5 ; Canil et al . , 2010 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2007 ) reveal the common presence of small amounts of sulfide , typically trapped as inclusions in silicate phases ( suggesting a primary magmatic rather than secondary hydrothermal origin ) .
Collisional orogens commonly undergo crustal thickening followed by extensional or transpressional collapse .
Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .
Magmas may be characterized by high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the presence of hornblende ( ± garnet , titanite ) in the amphibolitic lower crustal source rocks .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 are high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 are high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
At R - factors below ~ 10 2 , magmas will be depleted in both Cu and Au .
In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .
The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .
The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Nb , and Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .
The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .
The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .
Such magmas have the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Mo deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .
Such magmas have the potential to form Au - rich as well as normal Cu ± Mo porphyry and epithermal Au systems , depending on the amounts of sulfide present in the lower crustal source .
This process occurs most efficiently at depths greater than ~ 6 km large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes fed by arc or post - subduction magmas .
Such magmas , they argued , should be particularly suitable for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry copper deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .
These trace element characteristics are therefore an indicator of high magmatic water content rather than being a source signature , and this likely explains the common association of high - Sr / Y ( i . e . , hydrous ) magmas with magmatic - hydrothermal ore depositswithout magmatic water , such deposits cannot form .
Such magmas therefore have the potential subsequently to form porphyry Cu - Mo deposits .
These high sulfur contents have great significance for the behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals ( see Sections 2 . 1 . 1 , 2 . 5 . 1 , and 3 ) .
These volatiles drive buoyant , bubbly , evolved magma upwards into the cover rocks to form subvolcanic stocks and dikes , or explosive volcanic eruptions if they reach surface .
At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
Under lower f S2 post - subduction conditions ( a flux S from the subduction zone is no longer present ) , any residual sulfide phases would likely dissolve into the S - undersaturated silicate melt , carrying their metal loads with them ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ) .
These high observed metal solubilities are consistent with or exceed experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on chloride complexing alone ( e . g . , Holland , 1984 , 1986 ) , and suggest that other volatile ligands such as sulfide species may enhance the solubility of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in high temperature aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz et al . , 2008Zajacz et al . , , 2011 .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .
Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions of the supra - subduction zone mantle wedge , the bulk of the sulfur flux will likely consist of SO 2 or 1 4 0 0 °C 1 4 0 0 °C 60 0 °C 1 0 0 0 °C E c l o g i t e Sediment Metasomatized asthenosphere Fig . 1 .
Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .
Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .
Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .
Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .
Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .
Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
The ultimate metal inventory and metal ratios in any given porphyry deposit is secondarily controlled by late - stage magmatic and shallow crustal processes .
Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .
They include porphyry Cu - Mo deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .
Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .
In contrast , deep crustal amphibolites are preserved in the lithosphere , and will be susceptible to partial melting at any later time due to thermal rebound or reheating by invading asthenospheric melts .
Also shown are the thermal structure , fluid flow pathways and characteristics during the main stage of hydrothermal activity , and overlapping hydrothermal alteration zones .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry deposits .
The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .
Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .
Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .
Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .
( b - d ) During post - subduction tectonic processes , previously subduction - modified sub - continental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) or lower crustal hydrous cumulate zones residual from previous arc magmatism ( black layer ) may undergo small - volume partial melting .
Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .
Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
On the other hand , fluid focusing controls the lateral extent of mineralization .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
With the exception of porphyry Sn - W deposits that are associated with crustally derived S - type granites , most other deposits in this grouping are formed by calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline I - type granitoids directly or indirectly related to subduction .
Consequently , it is in collisional orogens such as the Neo - Tethyan belt southern Asia that some of the clearest examples of post - subduction magmatism and mineralization are found .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .
Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .
The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .
Depths are indicated for hydrostatic ( hyd ) and lithostatic pressure conditions .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
The question of whether the downgoing oceanic slab melts during subduction has prompted lively debate recently , not only in the petrology literature ( e . g . , Conrey , 2002 ; Kepezhinskas , 2001 , 2002 ; Garrison and Davidson , 2003 ) , but also amongst economic geologists because of the suggestion that " slab melts " might in some way be uniquely fertile for later porphyry ore formation ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Oyarzun et al . , , 2002Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Thiéblemont et al . , 1997 ; for contrary opinions , see : Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition Mo ± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .
A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .
A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .
A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical characteristics magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile elements .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .
A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .
In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .
The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .
Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .
( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed a similar model for giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposits in the southwestern USA .
However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .
In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .
Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .
Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant Bingham , Butte , Climax , Henderson , and Questa porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .
Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .
The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .
In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .
Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu original arc magmas .
Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .
Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming melts .
Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently , driving the oxidation potential of sulfate up to the hematite - magnetite oxygen fugacity ( HM ) buffer , which is ~ ΔFMQ + 4 .
Sulfate reduction and ferrous Fe oxidation form H + , which dramatically lowers pH values of ore - forming fluids and causes pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Porphyry Cu and Au deposits almost do have systematically higher oxygen fugacities and FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
Sulfates , including anhydrite and alunite ( likely related to the epithermal mineralization ) are abundant in the mineralization system , and hematite formed during chlorite alteration , indicating high oxygen fugacity up to the HM buffer ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
Adakites found in the Qulong deposit are mixtures of continental and slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Hematite has been reported , but it occurs as a secondary supergene ore forming mineral ( Shahabpour , 1991 ) .
Henderson porphyry Mo deposit is located in the Climax - Henderson Mo belt , Colorado .
High zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios indicate very high oxygen fugacity , comparable to those of Chuquicamata ( Fig . 12 ) .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ΔFMQ 0 ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Oxygen fugacity of Manus glasses was calculated using the following equa - ( Kress and Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes copper and a variety of other metal resources .
Sulfate reduction in hydrothermal fluids lowers the pH and consequently elevates oxygen fugacity of the system up to the HM buffer .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .
Degassing of SO 2 is not likely to be a main process for forming porphyry deposits because it cannot explain the features of reduced porphyries .
Water is the most abundant volatile component released during plate subduction .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent by processes crystallization , assimilation , degassing , etc ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 .
Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics arc magmas .
Thick continental arcs are more favorable for porphyry mineralization because of accumulation of copper rich sulfide cumulates ; ( B ) after Wilkinson ( 2013 ) , which also proposes that sulfide saturation and accumulation are very important for the formation of porphyry Cu deposits ; ( C ) after Richards ( 2011b ) , illustrating porphyry and epithermal mineralizations in arc and postcollisional settings ; ( D ) after Richards ( 2013 ) , highlighting features or processes that may result in supercharging of these systems to form giant deposits .
Crystallization of sulfide cannot explain this phenomenon , because Ni and Pt are even more chalcophile than Cu , with partition coefficients between sulfide and silicate melts of several hundreds and more than 20 thousand , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Adakite , slab melting , ridge subduction and porphyry Cu deposits
Adakite and porphyry Cu deposits
Partial melting of thickened eclogitic lower continental crust ( Wang et al . , 2006a ( Wang et al . , , b , 2007aZhang et al . , 2001a ) and fractional crystallization of garnet ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) or amphibole ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) may also form high Sr Y magmas .
Copper is incompatible in most major silicate minerals , but could be compatible in amphibole , depending on the composition of the magmas and amphibole ( Sun al . , 2012b , 2014a ) .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Geochemical signatures of ridge subduction are important exploration targets for large porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration is mainly controlled by pH values of the ore - forming fluids ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Dominant mineral changes from biotite in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , to K - feldspar in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Quartz K ± Nafeldspar overprints may destroy the more typical potassic assemblages .
Sericitic alteration in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages .
Metals porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require reduction of sulfate to sulfide during the final stage of mineralization .
Ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Hydrogen and methane form during the final mineralization porphyry deposits .
, slab melts with high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios ( Mungall , 2002 ) , as well as other oxidized components , e . g . , carbonates , or other oxidized sediments .
At oxygen fugacities below ΔFMQ + 1 , 10 % or less partial melting of the mantle wedge allows preservation of residual sulfides , assuming that the S abundances in the mantle wedge is also 250 ppm .
In highly oxidized porphyry magmas , sulfate , CO 2 and H 2 O are the dominant species , which are already oxidized and thus cannot reduce sulfate to sulfide , leaving ferrous iron as the only probable reducing agent ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The formation Baogutu porphyry deposit
The heterogeneous and reduced characteristics of the deposit are attributed to significant country rock contamination after emplacement ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) in an arc setting ( Shen et al . , 2013a , b ) .
The lack Re in these sulfides can be plausibly interpreted by the high oxygen fugacity , under which most of the Re is Re 6 + , and thus behaves as lithophile rather than chalcophile elements .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous Fe lower the pH value .
B . Porphyry deposits are associated with slab melts ( modified after Wilkinson , 2013 ) , which have high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ) .
The hematite - magnetite ( HM ) oxygen buffer has been taken as the upper limit of oxygen fugacities that are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The Cu - Au mineralizations that occur in the same ore bodies usually do not happen at the same time , indicating different sources and / or different mineralization processes .
The deposit spatially corresponds to the Juan Fernandez Ridge ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , and thus has been attributed to slab melting during ridge subduction ( Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
The Dexing porphyry deposit is closely associated with highly oxidized magmas ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Li and Sasaki , 2007 ) , e . g . , it is famous for abundant specular hematite , which mostly formed during late stage hydrothermal alteration ( Fig . 13 ) .
The Sar - Cheshmeh and several other giant Miocene porphyry deposits of Iran and Pakistan are located in a region undergoing continent - continent collision .
The sulfur content at sulfide saturation ( SCSS ) increases solely as a function of increasing fO 2 ( Jugo , 2009 ) : SCSS ¼ S 2 - h i 1 þ exp 2 : 23ΔFMQ - 2 : 89 ð Þ ð Þ ð9Þ and ΔFMQ C ¼ 1 : 29 þ 0 : 45 ln S 6þ h i - ln S 2 - h ið10Þ where ΔFMQ C refers to the critical fO 2 for simultaneous saturation of sulfide and sulfate ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
The reduction Cu and Au during magma evolution is well - known in arc magmas ( Moss et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Togashi and Terashima , 1997 ) , and has been referred to as the magnetite crisis .
The oxidation potential of the SO 4 2− - S 3 − reaction also rises with decreasing pH ( Fig . 11 ) , so that magnetite may be further oxidized to hematite by SO 4 2 − , releasing OH − ( Eq .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The mineralization ( 40 . 9 Ma ) and the emplacement age of the Catface porphyry ( 40 . 4 - 41 Ma ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) are both within the age range of the Mt Washington adakite .
The resulting adakites may then have been reduced through reaction with the thick ( maximum thickness of 4 km ) carbon - rich Cretaceous Nanaimo Group sediments ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) as they migrated upward .
This immiscibility implies that water is stable in the mantle under high pressure ( Bali et al . , 2013 ) .
The sulfide phase contains high Au and Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements , such as Ni , Re , and Pt .
The sulfide phase contains high Au and Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements Pt .
The alteration is characterized by transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
This deposit is related to the closure of a small backarc basin between Indonesia and the South China Sea .
Both Re - Os isochron and U - Pb zircon dating give the same age of ~ 111 Ma , which assigns it to the third mineralization pulse of the East Qinling Mo belt ( Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008Mao et al . , , 2011 .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma that is saturated with S - and metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
These anhydrite occurrences indicate that the Qulong magmatic - hydrothermal system was highly oxidized and sulfur - rich , with abundant sulfates ( Xiao et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 14 ) .
During mantle melting , Cu as well as Au and Mo are all moderately incompatible elements , with partition coefficients ranging between those of Yb and Ce ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003aSun et al . , , b , 2004a .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
A small sulfur - ( N 3 wt . % ) and copper - rich ( N0 . 5 wt . % ) fine - grained igneous rock known as " Porphyry A " stock ( b1 km 3 , 6 . 09 ± 0 . 18 Ma ) ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) has abundant igneous anhydrite , with varied textures ranging from interstitial to poikilitic and corresponding modal abundances from 10 to 20 % , respectively .
Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .
Copper , Au and Mo are chalcophile elements , which are strongly controlled by the behavior and speciation of sulfur .
Although reduced porphyry deposits are rare , with tonnages much smaller than oxidizing porphyry deposits ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , the mechanism needs to be clariﬁed .
Indeed , magnetite crystallization / alteration is often taken as the controlling process for porphyry Cu and Au mineralization by causing sulfate reduction and presumably also oxygen fugacity fluctuations ( Liang et al . , 2009 ) .
Although most of the porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas , a small group porphyry deposits are reported as apparently related to reduced magmas with oxygen fugacities ranging from ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Fig . 19 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The final porphyry mineralization is controlled by sulfate reduction , which is usually initiated by magnetite crystallization , accompanied by decreasing pH and correspondingly increasing oxidation potential of sulfate .
Source of copper
Given that volcanic systems are far more open , the initial Au contents are not of critical importance to porphyry mineralization .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
Thus , the magma chamber would need to be unrealistically thick , e . g . , thicker than the continental crust .
( 25 ) ) , releasing H + , which lowers pH and promotes further oxidation of ferrous Fe .
Many large porphyry Cu - Au deposits are connected to subduction of spreading and aseismic ridges ( Fig . 27 ) ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Most of the porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas , with sulfate the dominant sulfur mineral species .
Most of the sulfur magmas is present as sulfate at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 .
Therefore , residual sulﬁdes are more efﬁciently destroyed at oxygen fugacities higher than FMQ + 2 , releasing their chalcophile elements ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
Therefore , the crystallization of magnetite and hematite tends to lower the proportions of ferric iron in the magma , which apparently would lower the oxygen fugacity .
It contains native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Most of the C in magma occurs as CO 2 , therefore the oxygen buffer changes from graphite - CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria as the magma ascends ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .
In general , porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have FeO contents systematically lower than porphyry Cu , but higher than pure porphyry Mo deposits , with oxygen fugacities also falling between them ( Fig . 8 ) .
All types of porphyry deposits , ranging from Cu + Au , Cu + Mo , and Mo deposits , may be oxidized sufficiently to reach the redox states of the HM buffer .
Then , how do reduced magmas get enriched in Cu ?
Most of these ridges , however , are older 100 Ma ( W . D .
For example , Cenozoic porphyry deposits located in island arcs in the southwestern Pacific are all Cu - Au deposits , e . g . , Grasberg and Batu Hijau in Indonesia ; Panguna and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea ; Lepanto - Far South East , Tampakan , Atlas and Sipilay in the Philippines ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast , metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require low oxygen fugacity for their stabilization during the final stage of mineralization .
In addition , degassing cannot explain the decoupling between δD isotope compositions .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
For example , epithermal deposits formed in the mid ocean ridge and backarc basins usually do not have any associated porphyry deposit .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .
All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .
Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large Cu .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
In general , the alteration mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .
Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins arcs .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin Mariana arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .
At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

The lower portion of argillic lithocaps may overprint the upper parts porphyry Cu deposits , whereas the sericitic alteration transforms upwardly to quartz - pyrophyllite .
There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
It may also constitute ore Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence garnet and absence of plagioclase .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .
Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 ≥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 ≥ 15 wt . % , Y ≤ 18 ppm , Yb ≤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr ≥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .
One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .
It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .
Such conditions will promote the formation hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ﬂuids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .
Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
There are several ways to describe the oxidation of ferrous Fe .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
( 11 ) ) to the right , which leads to the oxidation of sulfide .
This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .
In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .
This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene magnetite and hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .
Basic principles of isotope geochemistry dictate instead that in degassing , i . e . , evaporating , the remaining liquid becomes isotopically heavier O .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .
tion : ln XFe2 O3 XFeO ¼ a lnƒO 2 þ b T þ c þ ΣdiXi , The occurrence of primitive hematite in closely association with magnetite strongly suggests a very high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 11 ) , such that reaching the HM oxygen fugacity buffer ( equivalent tõ ΔFMQ + 4 ) during porphyry Cu mineralization .
Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid immiscible phase separation .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .
Hydrothermal mineralization can cause enrichment or depletion elements in ore bodies and surrounding country rocks .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
In D - type veins the values of the parameter τ Fe and S compared to other elements considered in this study ( Table 2 and Tables Table 1 .
The spatial distribution of ore - forming elements at different scales is of primary importance for ore exploration , and researches in recent decades have demonstrated that similarity exists at different scales , or non - scale distribution , which can be investigated by fractal theory .
The rock samples were collected at different localities from veins within hydrothermal systems of the Dexing porphyry copper deposit ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
The total width or aperture f ( α ) spectrum reflects the enrichment in concentration of elements in local space .
The latest alteration and mineralization stage is characterized by carbonate - sulphate - oxide alteration and associated with H - type veins ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ) .
All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
The ∆α and ∆αL values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .
A range of trace elements , including Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti were analyzed on the surface of pyrite crystals using ESEM .
In recent years , fractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .
The values of the asymmetry index , R α , are all negative indicating that the widths of the left part f ( α ) spectrum are in all cases less than the widths of the right part .
We note , however , that fractured parts of the crystals often contain higher levels of trace elements .
To 1 achieve our goal , the distribution patterns of element concentration values of eight elements ( Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si and Ti ) on the pyrite surface selected from B - type , D - type and H - type veins and veinlets were represented by multifractal spectra .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of elements caused by mineralization is crucial for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
The results indicate that the element concentration pattern in D - type veins dispersed and , therefore , most favorable for Cu ore - concentration .
To achieve this objective , the distribution Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
Furthermore , a parameter called asymmetry index ( R α ) of multifractal spectrum curve , can effectively provide information about the ore - forming potential assessment .
These differences in the aperture of multifractal spectrum suggest a wide range of differences in the overall variability and in the heterogeneity of the studied element distributions which provide direct information on element behavior during crystallization and related differentiation processes .
This does not only contribute to obtain a full spectrum of element distributions at different scales , but should also provide a new way to characterize different vein types .
These parameters are found to be higher in the D - type veins late phyllic alteration and mineralization in comparison with other veins and vein systems , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are highly enriched in D - type veins .
This is consistent with field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis and previous investigations by other authors including Mao et al . ( 2011 ) , showing that the D - type veins are the most important for the mineralization in the Dexing porphyry deposit .
These parameters are indicators of symmetry / asymmetry of the multifractal system ( Montero , 2005 ; Miranda et al . , 2006 ; Arias et al . , 2012 ) .
Most applications of fractal theory use the monofractal - approach , which assumes that the spatial distribution of an element or other property of an object can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .
Carlson , 1991 ) , but little has been done on the concentration micro - distribution of elements at the crystal surfaces of major ore minerals ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low - quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO 4 , Fe , and associated metal ( loid ) s . Acid generated during the oxidation of sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .
Sulfide ore deposits are also important sources of Au and Ag , which may occur as native elements or be associated with sulfides .
Silicates , carbonates and sulfides generally dominate the mineralogical assemblage of fresh tailings .
Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of S - oxidizing bacteria .
High dissolved concentrations of Fe and SO4 generated via sulfide oxidation can promote formation of hardpan layers comprised of Fe ( oxy ) hydroxides or ( hydroxy ) sulfates .
The mineralogical and geochemical composition of sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The Greens Creek Mine is a NMD site and the Sherridon Mine is an AMD site .
Several metals including Fe , Al , Mn , Zn , Ni , Cu , and Pb may occur at high dissolved concentrations under AMD conditions .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
The resulting clay - to silt - sized particles are combined with water to form slurry and then treated with surfactants to render sulfide ore minerals hydrophobic .
In contrast , weakly hydrolyzing metals ( e . g . , Fe ( II ) , Zn , Cd ) and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements ( e . g . , As , Se , Sb ) tend to exhibit greater mobility under circumneutral pH conditions .
In contrast , ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Sb , Se , and Mo commonly exhibit greater mobility at circumneutral pH associated with neutral mine drainage ( NMD ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
Reductive dissolution or transformation of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide phases can enhance Fe , Mn , and As mobility within sulfide tailings .
Understanding the dynamics of these interrelated geochemical and mineralogical processes is critical for anticipating and managing water quality associated with sulfide mine tailings . Geochemistry and mineralogy of sulfide mine tailings are reviewed Case studies highlight metal transport and attenuation processes Interactions among chemical , biological and physical processes are complex Effective tailings management requires comprehensive understanding of processes
The extent of environmental impacts associated with sulfide tailings deposits depends upon their mineralogical and geochemical composition , and upon in - situ chemical , biological , and physical processes .
The extent of environmental impacts associated with sulfide tailings deposits depends upon their mineralogical and geochemical composition , and upon in - situ chemical , biological , and physical processes .
An integrated understanding of these complex interactions among chemical processes is critical for anticipating and mitigating potential environmental impacts associated with sulfide tailings .
Price ( 2009 ) provides a comprehensive description of methods for predicting drainage chemistry from sulfide mine tailings and other sulfide - bearing geologic materials .
Detailed reviews on aspects of tailings dams ( Kossoff et al . , 2014 ) and methods for geochemical and mineralogical characterization of mine wastes ( Raudsepp and Pani , 2003 ; Weisener , 2003 ; Jamieson et al . , this issue ) have also been published during this time .
Metasomatized mantle lithosphere or hydrous lower crustal cumulates residual from ﬁ rst - stage arc magmatism contain small amounts of chalcophile element– rich sulﬁ des , and constitute a fertile source for hydrous , Au - rich , but relatively sulfur - poor magmas during later remelting .
Porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au and related epi thermal Au deposits are intrusion centered , and are formed at ≤4 and ≤1 km depth , respectively , by fl uids exsolved from magmas emplaced at ~ 5 - 10 km depth in the upper crust ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
Arc magmas are predominantly formed by partial melting of the metasomatized wedge of asthenospheric mantle between the downgoing oceanic and overriding oceanic plates ( Ringwood , 1977 ) .
The cumulate residues from this process can be seen in exhumed lower crustal - upper mantle arc sections such as Talkeetna ( Alaska ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ) and Kohistan ( Pakistan ; Jagoutz et al . , 2007 ) .
Magmas processed through these lower crustal MASH zones commonly display relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the suppression of early plagioclase crystallization and the preferential partitioning of Y and middle rare earth elements into amphibole and garnet ( Green and Pearson , 1985 ) .
POSTSUBDUCTION MAGMATIC - HYDROTHERMAL ORE DEPOSITS Extensional Environments and Alkalic - Type Epithermal Au Deposits
Gold - rich porphyry and epithermal Au deposits associated with high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic magmas have recently been reported from arc collisional environments ( including collision with continents , microcontinent fragments , or mature island arcs ) .
Postsubduction magmatism can be viewed as a second stage of melting of subductionmodifi ed upper plate lithosphere , which may remobilize metals and other elements introduced during fi rst - stage arc magmatism .
Chalcophile elements such as Cu , Ni , Au , and PGE partition strongly into sulfi de phases relative to silicate melts , with partition coefficients increasing from Cu < Ni < Au and PGE ( Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Porphyry - and epithermal - style mineral deposits associated with postsubduction mag - matism are Au rich relative to many arc - related deposits , a characteristic that may reflect remelting of small amounts of residual sulﬁ de left in the deep lithosphere by arc magmatism .
Such magmas will have the potential to form porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits .
These basaltic magmas evolve and interact with the upper plate litho sphere as they ascend to form hybrid andesitic magmas characterized by relatively high oxidation states ( typically ~ 2 log f O2 units higher than the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer ) and high water contents ( ≥4 wt % H 2 O ) ( as reviewed in Richards , 2003 ) .
Thus , fi rst - stage arc magmas tend to generate Cu - rich porphyry systems , while leaving a relatively Au - rich residue in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle ( Richards , 2005 ) .
In mature island arcs or continental arcs , primitive basaltic magmas ascending from the mantle wedge typically stall at the base of the upper plate crust due to density contrasts ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ) .
Accordingly , arc magmas are commonly associated with high - sulfi dation - style epithermal deposits , whereas postsubduction systems are more typically low sulfi dation .
If this fertile , hydrous residue is subjected to a second stage of melting , either by invasion of small volumes of hot , oxidized asthenospheric magma , or thermal rebound after lithospheric thickening ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) , then Au - rich residual sulfide phases may redissolve ( R ≥ 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) to generate magmas with relatively high Au / Cu ratios ( Solomon , 1990 ; Richards , 2005 ) and perhaps also PGE enrichments ( cf .
Thus , regions of postsubduction magma - tism , which may have been overlooked by min - eral exploration strategies in the past , have the potential to host signiﬁ cant Au - rich porphyry and epithermal deposits .
The recognition that porphyry Cu - Au systems can also form in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings expands the range of geological environments and geographical terranes that are prospective for such deposits .
Examples include the Porgera gold deposits .
Recently , a number of porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits have been described in association with such magmas , with ages and from locations that are incompatible with a relationship to contemporaneous subduction , but consistent with postsubduction or collisional tectonic settings .
Examples include : the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in eastern central Turkey , which postdates Cretaceous - Paleocene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ) ; the late Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwest Iran , which postdates Paleogene - early Neogene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Richards et al . , 2006 ) ; Neogene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the southwest Pacifi c , which followed collision or subduction reversal ( Solomon , 1990 ) ; and mid - Miocene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in Tibet , which postdate Late Cretaceous collision between India and Asia ( Hou et al . , 2005 ) .
All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
Because of their sparsity ( under the relatively oxidizing but S - rich conditions of arc mag - matism ) , these sulﬁ de phases will be enriched in Au and other highly siderophile elements .
Late - stage partition - ing of these metals into hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved during cooling and crystallization of this magma at upper crustal levels generates magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits superﬁ - cially similar to arc - related porphyry and epi - thermal deposits , but more enriched in Au and of generally lower sulﬁ dation state .
They are thus directly linked to the petrogenesis of arc magmas , and derive their fundamental characteristics ( e . g . , relatively high oxidation state and enrichments in alkalies , S , Cl , H 2 O , and some metals ) from subduction processes .
However , there is increasing evidence for the existence of a suite of porphyry Cu - Au deposits related to magmas generated after subduc - tion beneath the arc has ceased .
In a process described by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) as melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) , heat released from this mafi c magma input causes partial melting of crustal rocks .

Richards * ABSTRACT Porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au and some epithermal Au deposits are formed from hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved from cooling , water - rich , calc - alkaline magmas emplaced in volcanoplutonic arcs above subduction zones .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits are mainly formed in subduction - related magmatic arcs ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1972Sillitoe , , 2010Richards , 2003 ) , yet it is still unclear why some magmatic arcs ( or sections of a magmatic arc ) are more Cu - endowed ( e . g . , Andes ; Sillitoe , 2012 ) .
High water contents promote the exsolution of aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Richards , 2011 ; Wang R et al . , 2014 ) , and substantially increase the efficiency of metal extraction from the silicate melts ( or crystal mush ) .
The sulfide - unsaturated magma would dissolve sulfides , if any , in the crust and elevate its PGE contents due to extremely high PGE budget in such sulfides .
5 . 3 Oxidized parental magma of the Pulang complex As mentioned above , two types of amphibole , namely high - Al amphiboles , were identified at the Pulang complex . Mineralogical compositions of different amphiboles can be used to evaluate the physicochemical conditions ( e . g . , pressure , temperature , oxygen fugacity and water content ) of the parental magma 17 from which the amphibole crystallized ( Fig . 14 ) , using the amphibole thermobarometers ( e . g . , Johnson and Rutherford , 1989 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) .
Both the intrusive complex and the related volcanic wall rocks have similar Pd / Pt ratios and primitive mantle - normalized PGE patterns , indicating that no discernible Two types of amphibole , i . e . , high - Al ( Al2O3 = 9 . 4 – 11 . 8 wt . % ) and low - Al ( 5 . 9 – 7 . 3 wt . % ) types , have been identified in the Pulang complex .
Thus , both high oxygen fugacity and water contents are ( 2 ) The Pulang complex was likely formed in a long - lived ( ~ 5 m . y . )
Although these magmas were oxidized , which is favorable for ore metal transport , they may have different physicochemical properties as indicated by the varying amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) .
The variation in PGE concentrations between different types of rocks at Pulang is probably ascribed to magma mixing between mafic and felsic end - members .
Furthermore , the PGE variations in the studied rocks can also be explained by the mixing of two melt end - members .
At Pulang , most of the volcanic rocks have consistent Pd / Pt ratios of ~ 1 ( Fig . 12 ; Table 3 ) , indicating that the lavas may not have fractionated Pt - alloys or sulfides .
5 . 2 Genetic link between porphyries and volcanic rocks at Pulang Porphyry stocks , as by - products of subduction - related magmas , are commonly emplaced in a subvolcanic environment covered by a volcanic edifice of pyroclastic rocks and / or lava flows ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1973 , 2010 ) , which is also documented at 15 plutons ( mostly intermediate in composition ) .
216 – 217 Ma and titanium - in - zircon temperatures of 685 – 706℃ , indistinguishable from those of the syn - mineralized MP and QMP ( 215 . 9 Ma and 695 ± 20℃ , and 215 . 1 – 217 . 1 Ma and 676 – 698 ℃ , respectively ) ( Table 1 ; Fig . 5 ) .
However , the genetic link between the intrusive and extrusive rocks is not always clear .
Our petrological modeling demonstrates that most zircons from the Pulang complex crystallized from a melt containing up to 40 – 50 % crustal materials , and around 10 – 20 % for the volcanic lavas ( Fig . 13 ) .
Three models have been proposed to interpret this linkage : ( 1 ) fractional crystallization from a common parental magma ( e . g . , Sisson and Grove , 1993 ; Sisson et al . , 2005 ; Feig et al . , 2006 ; Ulmer , 2007 ) , ( 2 ) mixing and hybridization of two end - member melts ( e . g . , Groves et al . , 2005 ; Reubi and Blundy , 2009 ) , and ( 3 ) the melt expulsion model ( especially for rhyolite , Bachmann and Bergantz , 2004 ; Bachmann et al . , 2007 ; Bachmann and Huber 2016 ) , in which the volcanic rocks are regarded as erupted melt - rich regions , while the crystal mush crystallized to form the depleted in incompatible and compatible elements ( Fig . 10e , f ) .
However , this hypothesis was challenged by Richards ( 2015 ) , who argued that the volume of sulfide accumulations is too small to significantly affect the Cu budget of primary arc magmas .
The QMP has a gradational contact with the QDP , suggesting that the QDP and QMP ( possibly also MP ) were formed in a these two slightly younger dikes yielded an elevated titanium - in - zircon temperature ( ~ 730 ℃ ; Fig . 5 ) , indicating that the late dike emplacements were likely triggered by brief injection of hotter magmas , which promoted the incremental growth of the of years , rather than tens of million years as previously considered ( e . g . , Zeng et al . , short timespan that cannot be distinguished by LA - ICP - MS dating method .
Vein types at Tongchang ore body and their alteration and mineralization characteristics .
This apparent multifractal behavior reveal that the spatial variability of studied element concentrations on surface of pyrite crystals from different veins and veinlets can be successfully correlated with the vein types and related alteration and mineralization zone delineated using other customized geological methods .
The multifractal analysis of elemental micro - distributions on scale of pyrite crystal surfaces were employed to allow quantitative insights into the geometrical organization of these elements .
Generally , all of the pyrite contains variable concentrations of Cu and other elements .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of elements caused by mineralization is crucial for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for ore - forming processes .
All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
The latest 11 alteration and mineralization stage is characterized by carbonate - sulphate - oxide alteration and associated with H - type veins ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
Electron microprobe analyses elements in magnetite and hematite from a range of mineral deposit types ( iron oxide - copper - gold ( IOCG ) , Kiruna apatite– magnetite , banded iron formation ( BIF ) , porphyry Cu , Fe - Cu skarn , Fe - Ti , V , Cr , Ni - Cu - PGE , Cu - Zn - Pb volcano - genic massive sulfide ( VMS ) and Archean Au - Cu porphyry and Opemiska Cu veins ) show compositional differences that can be related to deposit types , and are used to construct discriminant diagrams that separate different styles of mineralization .
Iron oxides also form minor to trace minerals in a large number of deposit types , including Ni - Cu - PGE magmatic massive sulfides , Cu - Zn - Pb VMS , Opemiska - type Cu veins and clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits ( Leach et al . 2010 ) .
Iron oxides also form minor to trace minerals in a large number of deposit types , including Ni - Cu - PGE magmatic massive sulfides , Cu - Zn - Pb VMS , Opemiska - type Cu veins and clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits ( Leach et al . 2010 ) .
Vanadium partitioning , in contrast , is decreasing with higher oxygen fugacity , and has a higher mineral - liquid partition coefficient in magnetite ( ~ 0 . 4–1 . 5 ) than clinopyroxene ( Toplis and Corgne 2002 ) .
Partition of Nb , Ta , and Hf between magnetite and mafic to intermediate silicate melts is strongly controlled by the Ti and Al content of magnetite ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
HFS elements are more incompatible relative to Ti in magnetite at lower temperature and / or lower pressure ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
Porphyry - Cu , IOCG and Kiruna - type high - temperature hydrothermal deposits have intermediate average Mn similar to lower temperature VMS deposits .

The average concentrations of several elements ( e . g . , Ni ) , typical magmatic deposit types , are however significantly higher from those of other types of mineral deposits ( Fig . 2 ) .
The Ni + Cr vs . Si + Mg diagram can be used to isolate Ni - Cu - PGE , and Cr deposits from other deposit types .
The VMS deposits studied comprise examples formed in four of the five lithotectonic settings recognized for this deposit type ( Franklin et al . 2005 ) , range in age from Archean ( ex . Ansil ) to Recent ( ex . ODP Mound ) , and have been affected by sub - greenschist to amphibolite metamorphism .
These divalent cations have small ( Mn ~ 1–4 ) to moderate ( Ni ~ 20–100 ) magnetite - liquid partition coefficients ( Toplis and Corgne 2002 ) .
Only two elements ( Co and Ga ) have concentrations that are too low for analysis by Miner Deposita ( 2011 ) 46 : 319–335 333 EMPA .
Based on the trace element composition of magnetite from selected VMS , skarn , IOCG deposits from Australia , Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) concluded that magnetite incorporates trace elements that are typical for a specific deposit type .
Variations in the whole rock chemical environment in which magnetite grows control its chemical composition ( Hutton 1950 ; Buddington and Lindsley 1964 ; Scheka et al . 1980 ; Razjigaeva and Naumova 1992 ; Deer et al . 1992 ) .
In addition to forming iron ore in various types of sedimentary ironstones , iron oxides are abundant in iron oxide - copper - gold ( IOCG ) and Kirunatype apatite - magnetite deposits .
Other diagrams such as the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or the Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V are not discriminant for Ni - Cu - PGE and VMS deposits , but are useful to distinguish IOCG from Kiruna - type , porphyry Cu , BIF , skarn , and Fe - Ti - V deposits .
Other diagrams such as the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or the Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V are not discriminant for Ni - Cu - PGE and VMS deposits , but are useful to distinguish IOCG from Kiruna - type , porphyry Cu , BIF deposits .
On the other hand , even if Cr , Fe - Ti , and V deposits are represented by fewer analyses ( Table 2 ) , their chemical composition is characteristic enough to allow their classification within the discriminant diagrams pre - sented in this paper .
Moreover , 11 out of the 14 elements ( Ti , Si , Al , Mg , V , Cr , Mn , Ni , Cu , Zn , Sn ) detected in magnetite using the LA - ICP - MS method by Carew ( 2004 ) are also measured using EMPA method , whereas only three elements measured by Carew ( 2004 ) are not detected by EMPA .
Samples plotting outside the Ni - Cu - PGE and Cu - Zn - Pb VMS fields are discriminat - ed using the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V diagrams that discriminate for IOCG , Kiruna deposits .
Samples plotting outside the Ni - Cu - PGE and Cu - Zn - Pb VMS fields are discriminat - ed using the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V diagrams that discriminate for IOCG , Kiruna , porphyry Cu , BIF , skarn , Fe - Ti , and V deposits .
Discriminant diagrams such as the Ni + Cr vs . Si + Mg diagram for Ni - Cu - PGE deposits , and the Al / ( Zn + Ca ) vs . Cu / ( Si + Ca ) diagram for VMS and clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits are useful to distinguish these types of deposits .
For example , the h ighes t ave rage Mn is measured no t on ly in h igh temperature magmatic Ni - Cu deposit - types but also in low - temperature clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits ( Fig . 2 ) .
Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) measured the trace element composition of magnetite from selected VMS deposits from Australia , and divided the data into three groups : group A elements ( Mg , Al , Ti , V , Mn , Co , Ni , Zn , Ga , Sn ) are commonly measured above the detection limit using LA - ICP - MS and have consistent results and elemental patterns from grain to grain in one sample , group B elements ( Cr , As , Zr , Nb , Mo , REE , Ta , W , Pb ) yielded lower and heterogeneous concentration and patterns , whereas group C elements ( Cu , Ag , Se , Tl , Te , Bi , Au ) were commonly below the minimum limit of detection .
In summary , Carew ( 2004 ) showed that magnetite from Cloncurry district IOCG deposits is characterized by higher Sn and Mn and lower V , Ti , Mg , Si , Cr , and Zn concentrations compared to barren ironstones whereas hematite is characterized by higher As , Ga , Sb , and W concentration .

Finally , Nadoll et al . ( 2009 ) measured trace elements in magnetite from hydrothermal ore deposits and their host rocks in the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup of western Montana and northern Idaho ( USA ) using both electron microprobe ( EMPA ) and LA - ICP - MS methods .
Razjigaeva and Naumova ( 1992 ) showed that Ti , Mn , Cr , V concentration could be used to trace the source rocks of sediments whereas Grigsby ( 1990 ) used a combination of petrographic exsolution features and chemical composition criteria in a flowchart decision tree to determine the likely source of detrital magnetite grains .

According to Nadoll et al . ( 2009 ) , the fact that only subtle geochemical differences were observed can be explained by the low temperature of formation of the orebodies and the metamorphic history of the Belt terrane , resulting in sub - solidus re - equilibration of hydrothermal magnetite .
Finally , some deposit types have not been studied , such as diamond - bearing kimberlite deposits .
Factor analysis reveals small but distinct differences between magnetite from the various geological settings that define magnetite varieties : ( 1 ) magnetite with elevated Mg - Mn from hydrothermal Ag - Pb - Zn veins and postmetamorphic igneous intrusions , and ( 2 ) magnetite with elevated V - Co - Zn from burial metamorphic rocks , postmetamorphic igneous intrusions and sediment - hosted Cu - Ag deposits .
Despite the uneven detail of investigation , the selected examples of Ni - Cu massive sulfides , porphyry Cu , VMS deposits display a range of deposits considered typical for these deposit type ( Table 2 ) .
However , we propose other discriminant criteria to similarly discriminate between VMS , skarn deposits ( Figs . 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
Despite extensive experimental evidence and theoretical modeling , significant uncertainty remains on the calibration of the thermo - oxybarometer at temperature below 600 °C and for oxides with minor concentration Cr2O3 ( Sauerzapf et al . 2008 ) .
Carew ( 2004 ) used the laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) technique to measure a large range of trace elements in magnetite , hematite , pyrite , and chalcopyrite from IOCG deposits , Na - Ca and K - Fe alteration , barren ironstones , and hostrocks from the Cloncurry district in Australia .
EMPA spot analyses have a higher spatial resolution ( < 10 μm ) compared to lower spatial resolution for LA - ICP - MS analyses ( > 50 μm ) such that EMPA analyses are less susceptible to contamina - tion by small inclusions in the mineral of interest .
Least - altered samples from the Yulong intrusion have high SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) and Al2O3 ( 14 . 9–15 . 5 wt % ) contents , high Sr / Y 1 / 58 Journal Pre - proof ( 46 . 0–76 . 3 ) ratios , and low MgO ( 0 . 63–1 . 24 wt % ) and Cr ( < 30 ppm ) contents , similar to adakitic rocks deriving from thick juvenile lower crust .
Magmatic water contents decrease from early - ( 3 . 5–4 . 6 wt % ) to late - stage ( 2 . 8–3 . 5 wt % ) amphibole , which is interpreted to indicate fluid exsolution from the magma chamber during emplacement of the Yulong intrusion .
Porphyry Cu deposits are typically developed in oceanic slab subduction - related magmatic arcs ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 1972 , 2010 ) , and are genetically related to partial melting of mantle wedge ( Richards , 2003 , 2011 ) .
Lithospheric mantle - derived mafic lavas coeval with Journal Pre - proof the Yulong intrusion are widely developed in the Nangqian Basin ( Deng et al . , 2001 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ) , which is about 100km NW of Yulong ( Fig . 1B ) .
Textural and compositional variations of silicate mineral phenocrysts ( amphibole , plagioclase ) suggest that the magma chamber beneath Yulong ( 7 . 1–12 . 5 km in depth ) might have been recharged by a mafic magma , and was saturated in magmatic fluids at the time of emplacement of the Yulong intrusion ( 4 . 0–5 . 6 km in depth ) .
The Yulong intrusion has mainly positive zircon εHf ( t ) values ( 0 . 5–8 ) and young Hf mantle model ages ( Figs . 8C and 9A ; Table 3 ) , suggesting its origin from a depleted or juvenile source .
The magmatic oxidation states are high , and increase during magma evolution , which may have been essential to the enrichment of metals in the evolving magma .
These Sr - Nd - Hf - O isotopes , in combined with the high whole - rock SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) contents and La / Yb ratios ( 36 . 4–68 . 0 ) , low MgO ( 0 . 63–1 . 24 % ) and Cr ( < 30ppm ) contents , and the arc - like trace element patterns , suggest that the 25 / 58 In summary , the magma chamber beneath Yulong might have been recharged by a compositionally less evolved magma , and was saturated in magmatic fluid before or coeval with the emplacement of the Yulong stock in the magma chamber .
These Hf isotopes ages overlap those of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related arc 20 / 58 Journal Pre - proof magmas in the north Qiangtang terrane ( Fig . 10 ; Zi et al . , 2012b ) .
Although partial melting of alkalic - rich igneous rocks has been attributed to asthenospheric upwelling ( e . g . , Zhang and Xie , 1997 ) , the cause of asthenospheric upwelling remains controversial . Several models have been 22 / 58 suggested that efficient hybridization between mafic and felsic magmas could only happen under the conditions of high temperature and intense magma convection in depth ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) .
Mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components could have happened in the source , or by magma mixing during emplacement .
The elevated oxygen fugacity will suppress early formation of Cu - rich sulfides , and thus will be favorable for metal transportation and enrichment during magma evolution and emplacement ( Mungall , 2002 ; Jugo et al . , 2005 ; Richards , 2015 ) .
Although a few inherited zircons have been found in the Yulong intrusion ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , the relatively uniform zircon Hf - O and apatite Sr - Nd isotopes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) probably indicate that crustal contamination is insignificant during emplacement of Yulong .
Despite a mass of whole rock geochemical and zircon Hf isotopic studies , origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains controversial . Major disputes include partial melting of the ancient subduction - metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or the juvenile mafic arc lower crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal 3 / 58 precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant between zircon εHf ( t ) and δ18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant between zircon εHf ( t ) and δ18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .
This is possibly caused by late - stage fractionation or fluid exsolution process , 24 / 58 Journal Pre - proof as the caculated fO2 values are negatively correlated with water contents ( Fig . 12D ) .
It has been suggested that the Yulong intrusion originated directly from low - degree partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or formed by assimilation - fractional crystallization ( AFC ) of 19 / 58 Journal Pre - proof metasomatized mantle - derived melts ( Hou et al . , 2003 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .
Collectively , we propose that the magma chamber beneath Yulong was recharged by a less evolved magma , and was saturated in fluids to produce intensive alteration and mineralization .
It is widely accepted that relatively high magmatic oxidation states ( ΔFMQ > + 1 , where FMQ is the fayalite - magnetite - quartz buffer ; Mungall , 2002 ; Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2015 ) , high water contents ( > 4 wt . % ; Richards , 2011 ) , and high sulfur and halogen contents ( Streck snd Dilles , 1998 ; Chelle - Michou and Chiaradia , 2017 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) are all indispensable conditions for porphyry Cu mineralization .
In this contribution , 4 / 58 we present new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes of the ore - related Yulong intrusion , with the aim of providing new evidences for the origin of Yulong deposit .
This indicates that they may have formed in similar geodynamic setting .
This interpretation is consistent with the conclusion based on periodic sulfur zonation in apatite crystals at Yulong ( Huang et al . , 2019b ) , and is also in agreement with the repeated exsolution of fluids ( Chang et al . , 2018 ) .
Andesitic magmas containing more than about 1 - 1 . 5 wt % dissolved H 2 O have more H 2 O than can be accommodated in hydroxyl sites of igneous minerals , so the rest migrates to country rocks or to the atmosphere during crystallisation .
Orthosilicates such as olivine and zircon that use only silica monomers should rise in saturation temperature owing to increasing supply of monomers upon addition of the first few percent H 2 O to dry melt ( cf .
Tectonic disturbance may disrupt the magmatic plumbing system , causing volcanic vents and subvol - canic apophyses to relocate , with the result that succes - sive mineralisation pulses do not superpose to generate a large composite ore deposit .

The two Neogene ore provinces along the west side of the Neogene - Quaternary Altiplano uplift and along the west side of the Sierras Pampeanas Neogene thrust and fold belt are coincident in time and space with latitude intervals of strong orogenic deformation by agents illustrated in blue .
Values of Sr / Y > 35 and V / Sc > 32 . 5–0 . 385  wt % SiO2 at 58–70 wt % SiO2 are typical of arc magmas parental to magmatic - hydrothermal copper ore deposits at conver - gent plate margins throughout Phanerozoic time , accord - ing to my compilation of compositions of ore - forming intrusions in 135 deposits .
Thus , in more hydrous mafic - to - felsic magmatic differentiation series , the ratios Al 2 O 3 / TiO 2 and Sr / Y in wholerock analyses may be expected to rise more strongly with rising SiO 2 , whereas these ratios may be expected to remain flat or decline with rising SiO 2 in weakly hydrous differentiation series ( Loucks 2000 ) .
At high contents of dissolved H 2 O in the melt , hornblende can saturate before titanomagnetite ( Figure 2 ) and can deplete the melt Fe 3þ as well as Fe 2þ and thereby delay and suppress production of magnetite .
Chemical screening of whole - rock analyses to identify arc segments , individual igneous complexes within them , and stages in the evolution of long - lived magmatic centres that match the chemical features of copper - ore - forming arc magmas , is one of two principal criteria that exploration geologists should apply to selection of geologically favourable target regions .
At P H2O ¼ 0 ( dry ) , the crystallisation order of silicates from the cooling melt is plagioclase first , followed by olivine , orthopyroxene and then augite .
Figure 1 shows the distribution of late Paleogene copper ( AE gold AE silver AE molybdenum ) - bearing magmatichydrothermal ore deposits in the central Andes .
can it be explained by serendipitous subduction of local compositional anomalies in the oceanic lithosphere such as volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits or serpentinised fracture zones .
Cognate xenoliths of high - pressure cumulates in volcanic rocks provide corroborative evidence ( e . g .
Each black dot represents an experiment in which the crystallising mineral assemblage was identified by Moore & Carmichael ( 1998 ) , and the melt ' s content of dissolved H 2 O ( dotted grey contours ) was determined from the composition of the quenced glass according to the method of Moore et al . ( 1998 ) .
My survey of the extensive literature on petrology of late Cenozoic igneous centres in the unmineralised Southern Volcanic Zone of Chile finds that the latitude interval 35 - 45 S contains a larger proportion of basalts , and corroborates the report by Hildreth & Moorbath ( 1988 ) that its andesites hornblendepoor or - absent .
The take - away messages from this time - space distribution of ore deposits are that : ( 1 ) the controls on metallogenic fertility operate not at the at the scale of individual magmatic centres , but rather over hundreds of kilometres of arc length including many magmatic centres ; and ( 2 ) the ability of certain arc segments to turn on and shut off metallogenic activity and migrate fore and aft while remaining magmatically active implies that copper metallogenic fertility is not due to recycling pre - existing Cu enrichments within the lithosphere , such as often appears to be the case for tin , molybdenum , uranium and fluorine ore provinces .

The H 2 O þ or loss - on - ignition in a whole - rock chemical analysis does not represent the water content of hydrous magmas from which the rock crystallised , so the hydration state of magmas must be assessed from thermodynamic analysis of mineral - melt equilibria , such as the plagioclase / melt hygrometer ( Housh & Luhr 1991 ; Rohrlach & Loucks 2000 ; Lange et al . 2009 ) or inferred qualitatively from whole - rock element ratios .

seamount chains , or oceanic plateaus was synchronous with ore formation , resulting in crustal thickening , rapid uplift , and exhumation .
Volatiles from the ridge may cause metasomatism of the mantle wedge , possibly accompanied by an increased sulfur flux due to subduction of metalliferous sediments in pressure shadow zones behind highs on the downgoing plate .
In oceanic island arcs , ridge subduction may lead to slab flattening and / or brief episodes of arc reversal .
These giant deposits are clustered within three provinces , central Chile , northern Chile , and southwest Arizona - northern Mexico .

Without efficient mineralizing processes , the most fa - vorable geodynamic processes and crustal architecture may still only produce a giant , low - grade geochemical anomaly .
He inferred that the flat slab was related to an elongate swell and associated oceanic plateau related to the ancestral Yellowstone hot spot .
Other factors , such as sutures in the overriding plate , permeability architecture of the upper crust , efficient processes of ore transport and deposition , and , in some cases , formation and preservation of su - pergene enrichment blankets are also vital for the development of high - grade giant ore deposits .
While most of the available isotopic , fluid , and melt inclusion evidence points toward a preponderance of magmatic - de - rived fluids in porphyry systems ( e . g . , Davidson et al . , 2005 ; 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 815 Downloaded from http : / / pubs . geoscienceworld . org / segweb / economicgeology / article - pdf / 100 / 5 / 801 / 3459346 / 801 . pdf by China University of Geosciences Beijing user on 15 June 2021 816 COOKE ET AL .
The approximate position of the Murray Ridge has been interpreted from bathymetry images of the National Geophysical Data Centre ( http : / / www . ngdc . noaa . gov / ngdc . html ) .
This may lead to the generation of oxidized melts that can transport copper , gold , and sulfur dioxide from the mantle to the upper crust ( e . g . , Richards , 2003 ) .
Other ongoing controversies regarding porphyry systems that are discussed in this volume include the relative importance of cooling ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , hy - drothermal alteration ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , and fluid mix - ing ( e . g . , Frikken et al . , 2005 ) for deposition of high - grade ore in porphyry systems , the relative importance of ridge subduc - tion and flat subduction in the formation of giant porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ) , the nature and origin of copper mineralization at the largest of the Andean deposits , El Teniente ( e . g . , Skewes et al . , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , the duration and timing of magmatic - hydrothermal activity ( e . g . , Río Blanco - Los Bronces : Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; El Teniente : Maksaev et al . , 2004 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , and the relative importance of strike - slip , compressional and extensional tectonism during the formation of the Eocene - Oligocene porphyry belt of northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ) .
In the last 20 m . y . , the formation of giant porphyry copper - molybdenum deposits in the cir - cum - Pacific region has been closely associated with subduction of aseismic ridges , seamount chains , and oceanic plateaus beneath oceanic island and continental arcs .
Bold arrows indicate the direction of relative plate motions .
Harris et al . , 2005 ) , there are data from individual deposits that are not readily explained by a purely orthomagmatic model for ore formation and probably require input of exter - nal fluids during the mineralizing processes ( e . g . , Frikken et al . , 2005 ) .
Also shown are the locations of the Reko Diq and Sar Chesmeh porphyry copper - gold deposits and the Sungun porphyry copper - molybdenum deposit ( 650 Mt at 0 . 76 % Cu and 0 . 01 % Mo ; Kirkham and Dunne , 2000 ) .
This review has focused on young systems , where the ar - chitecture of the downgoing plate can be inferred from sea - floor bathymetry .
Overall , the aim of the special issue is to help explorers and researchers better understand how and where processes of ore formation have combined effectively to produce some of the world’s largest high - grade hypogene porphyry copper and gold resources .
Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotope data have long been used as a powerful tool in evaluating crustal evolution ( e . g .
Gabbro in this zone has Ordovician LA–ICP - MS U–Pb zircon ages for MORB - type ophiolite assemblages ( Wang et al . , 2013a ) , and the ages of oceanic deep - marine chert range from late Early Devonian to Middle Triassic ( Feng and Ye , 1996 ) .
Three high - Hf and low TDM c domains are present along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan tectonic belt ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) , which correspond to the Eocene - Oligocene associated mineralization .
Hf isotopic mapping and relationships with mineralization The Late Triassic porphyry Cu and Eocene - Oligocene porphyry Cu ( –Mo ) deposits are clustered in regions with Hf values of 0 to 2 , and TDM c ages of 1100 - 800 Ma along the Garze–Litang and Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan sutures ( Figs . 8 , 9 , 10 ; Table S1 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) .
Cretaceous magmatism and associated Sn mineralization are probably related to the subduction and collision of the Neo , Meso - Tethyan plate .
Intrusions associated with Pb–Zn–Ag mineralization are characterized by nearly positive zircon εHf values ( −3 . 1 to + 0 . 2 ) and Meso - to Neoproterozoic TDM c ages ( 1300 to 1100 Ma ) ( Table S1 ) .
Late Triassic and Eocene– Oligocene porphyry–skarn Cu– ( Mo ) deposits are distributed in the Yidun Arc Terrane , and along or in the vicinity of the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture .
Cretaceous–Paleogene hydrothermal vein - type Sn–W systems , are located within the Tengchong–Baoshan and Yidun Arc terranes , and are probably related to the subduction and collision of the Neo - , Meso - Tethys .
Late Triassic intrusions with variable Hf values and TDM c ages , and associated skarn and hydrothermal vein - type Pb–Zn–Cu–Ag mineralization show a wide distribution along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture , and within the Tengchong–Baoshan and Yidun Arc terranes .
Late Triassic and Cretaceous–Paleogene hydrothermal vein - type Pb–Zn–Cu–Ag mineralization show a wide distribution along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture , and within the Tengchong–Baoshan and Yidun Arc terranes .
Magmatism 30 associated with porphyry–skarn Cu– ( Mo ) mineralization with high Hf values and low TDM c ages has a mantle source .
Granite magmatism associated with Pb–Zn–Cu–Ag mineralization , with variable Hf values and TDM c ages is characterized by source components involving both older reworked crust and subordinate contribution from juvenile material .
The Changning–Menglian Suture separates two distinct Hf isotopic domains with an old , reworked , crustal block to the southwestern part of the SJTO , and a juvenile crustal block with significant mantle - derived components to the northeastern part of the orogen .
The magmatic source intrusions in the eastern high - Hf , low TDM c domain , is dominated by mantle components and gave rise to porphyry and porphyry–skarn Cu– ( Mo ) mineralization .
The high Hf low TDM c domains are present within the East Qiangtang and Simao terranes , and the South China Craton , and one low - Hf , high TDM c domain is present in the Zhongza and Yiduan Arc terranes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The high - Hf and low TDM c 22 domains are present within the East Qiangtang and Simao terranes , and the South China Craton , and one low - Hf , high TDM c domain is present in the Zhongza and Yiduan Arc terranes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The suture clearly represents an important boundary between the Baoshan and Simao terranes .
The collision resulted in a thickened lithosphere along and near the suture , causing partial delamination of the thickened lithospheric mantle , and the generation of intracontinental potassic intrusions and associated mineralization ( Lu et al . , 2013a , b , 2015 ; Deng et al . , 2014a , b ) .
The Early Cretaceous skarn and hydrothermal vein - type Sn–W systems are located around a residual older crustal block with the oldest TDM c ages in the Tengchong and Yidun Arc terranes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The Early Cretaceous , Late Cretaceous and Paleogene hydrothermal vein - type Sn–W systems are located around a residual older crustal block with the oldest TDM c ages in the Tengchong and Yidun Arc terranes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The late Triassic granodioritic plutons and related skarn Cu mineralization are generally located along the Jinshajiang Suture .
The suture represents the remnant of Meso Tethyan Ocean , and Hf isotopic data indicated that the SJTO is into an old , reworked , crustal terrane to the west , and a juvenile crustal terrane to the east .
These potassic intrusions are interpreted as the product of the partial melting of a K - rich mafic source in the lower crust hybridized with a metasedimentary component .
These intrusions were probably derived from the partial melting of a Neoproterozoic lower crust related to the subduction and collision of the Neo - , Meso - Tethys ( Deng et al . , 2014b ; Li et al . , 2014 ) .
The 28 Paleogene magmatism and associated Sn mineralization , however , might be the product of post - collisional processes ( Ma et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2014b ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) .
Thus , the suture appears to have exerted important controls on the localizations Triassic magma and associated porphyry - skarn mineralizations .
The younger Eocene - Oligocene Cu– Au mineralization along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture were formed in a post - collisional intracontinental setting ( Lu et al . , 2013a , b , 2015 ) .
However , the relationship crustal boundaries magma - related deposits has not been investigated in detail , which is critical in understanding the crustal evolution and spatio - temporal distribution of the different mineral deposits .
However , the India–Asia continental collision during the Eocene–Oligocene reactivated the Mesozoic Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture .
However , the Late Cretaceous intrusions and associated Pb–Zn–Ag mineralization took place in a post - collisional intracontinental setting .
In contrast , the magma sources for intrusions in the low - Hf , high TDM c domains contain an old reworked crustal component and gave rise to granite - related Sn–W mineralization .
If this is correct , the Late Triassic porphyries and associated copper deposits formed during or after arc - continent collision followed by slab break - off and upwelling of hot asthenosphere at ~ 216 Ma , not during active westward - directed subduction .
The high TDM c values correspond to metamorphic rocks and are interpreted to reflect the presence of a long - lived Paleoproterozoic crustal block ( Yunnan BGMR , 1990 ) .
Integrating the available information from tectonic events , sedimentary successions , paleobiogeography , and paleolatitude based on paleomagnetic data , the Hf isotopic maps that we construct highlight the Changning– Menglian Suture as an important tectonic boundary between the Gondwana and Cathaysian continents .
The figure shows that there is a ~ 38 km thick continental crust in the Tengchong–Baoshan Terrane , with low - Hf high TDM c values magmatic rocks .
Several investigations were focused on the important Cu–Mo , Pb–Zn–Ag , Au deposits including the Yulong porphyry Cu–Mo deposit , the Gacun volcanogenic massive sulfide ( VMS ) - type Pb–Zn–Ag deposit , the Zhenyuan orogenic Au deposit , the Jinding Mississippi Valley Type ( MVT ) Pb–Zn deposit , and the Lailishan granite - related Sn deposit ( e . g .
Smith and Smith , 1976 ; Hickmott et al . , 1992 ) , Sm–Nd isotopic mapping have recently been regarded as tools for the evaluation of crustal evolution , including defining the boundaries of terranes and constraining the localization of mineral deposits ( Mole et al . , 2012 , 2014 ; Wyche et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2013a ; Champion and Huston , 2015 ; Hou et al . , 2015 ) .
If these interpretations are correct , the formation of Sn ore in the SJTO could have been triggered by granitic magmatism in both subduction and post - collisional tectonic settings ( Fig . 11 ) .
In this study , we present an overview and re - evaluation of the Cu–Mo , Pb–Zn–Ag , Au , and Sn metallogenesis in the SJTO .
Despite some disagreement , most researchers prefer the mechanism involving the removal lower lithospheric mantle along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture , which acted as a mechanically weakened lithospheric discontinuity ( Lu et al . , 2012 , 2013a , b , 2015 ; Deng et al . , 2014b ) .
This suggests the presence of an old , reworked crustal component , whereas the ~ 42 km thick crust high - Hf low TDM c values suggesting the presence of a juvenile crust component for the magmatic rocks there ( Fig . 10 a–c ) .
Partial melts of hydrated oceanic crust in subduction zones ( slab melts , or " adakites " ) are thought to have high Sr / Y ratios because of the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase in basaltic rocks undergoing eclogite facies metamorphism ( Kay , 1978 ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ) .
Unradiogenic Sr isotope compositions furthermore indicate that continental crustal components , which could generate " adakite - like " trace element signatures , were not present in the source .
Fractionation of or equilibration garnet
Such rocks share many trace element characteristics of adakites , but are demonstrably not slab melts ( e . g . , Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ) .
Chondrite - normalized REE compositions of rocks from two Quaternary Central Andean stratovolcanoes , Ollaguë and Llullaillaco , illustrating typical patterns reflecting garnet fractionation .
Metals therefore remain in the magma until they are partitioned into exsolving hydrothermal fluids .
Arc magmas with high water content will crystallize large amounts of amphibole ± garnet during early differentiation in deep crustal MASH or hot zones ( up to 90 % amphibole ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) , and will therefore evolve to high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) compositions , with listricshaped REE patterns ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ) .
High magmatic water content is a prerequisite for the forma - tion of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits ; thus , this para - meter can be used to evaluate the prospectivity of arc mag - matic suites .
If deep crustal ( MASH zone ) magmatic systems need time to evolve to more hydrous compositions , then this may explain why many major porphyry epochs form late in the history of a given arc , commonly after several million years of largely barren magmatism ( Richards , 2003 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009b ) .
under eclogite facies conditions , rather than melting of overlying mantle wedge ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) .
But in more mature continental arcs , they typically stall at density barriers in the mantle or at one or more levels in the crust , where they undergo wall - rock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) , or MASH processes ( melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Annen et al . , 2006 ) , leading to the development of intermediate composition calcalkaline magmas .
However , high sulfur content and oxidation states alone will not result in the exsolution of an aqueous volatile phase : high magmatic water content is the sine qua non of magmatic - hydrothermal ore - forming systems .
Stalling of mafic magmas in the mantle or at the base of the crust results in the crystallization of ultramafic to gabbroic cumulates in which garnet is a common early fractionating or residual phase ( Hamilton , 1981 ; DeBari and Sleep , 1991 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Macpherson , 2008 ; Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Coldwell et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to water , slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur ; when generated by flat subduction with associated compressional stress in the upper plate , these magmas might be trapped as non - erupting , closed - system , upper - crustal plutons , where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being vented to the surface as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ) .
Consequently , the high Sr / Y ratios in some intrusive rocks associated with porphyry deposits have been taken as an indication that the parental magmas slab melts , and that such magmas are uniquely fertile for porphyry ore formation upon emplacement in the upper crust ( Thiéblemont et al . , 1997 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .
This leads to the formation of andesitic to dacitic differentiates with HREE - depleted normalized REE patterns , and consequent high Sr / Y ratios ( Fig . 1 ; Feeley and Davison , 1994 ; Kay et al . , 1999 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ) .
Estimates for initial water content in primary arc magmas typically range from 1 to 3 wt percent H 2 O ( Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ) , but may reach 6 to 8 wt percent H 2 O in some primitive arc basalts ( Wallace , 2005 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) .
An additional effect of high magmatic water content is the suppression of plagioclase crystallization relative to hornblende ( Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ) , resulting in early increases in Sr content , and weak or absent Eu anomalies on normalized REE diagrams ( Fig . 2 ) .
The critical role of water High sulfur contents and relatively high oxidation states are characteristic of all arc magmas , to greater or lesser degrees ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) .
The mineralogical origins of high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) ratios in arc magmas do not in themselves seem to have any direct effect on the potential of these magmas generate hydrothermal ore deposits : garnet , amphibole , or plagioclase fractionation are not suggested to have any significant effect on the partitioning of metals into magmas .
The disagreement lies in the different sources magmas , the implications that these different models have for plate tectonic settings conducive to porphyry ore formation , and the consequences for mineral exploration strategies .
However , it is the case that magmas with high Sr / Y ratios can be derived by several postmelting magmatic processes , including the following : ( 1 ) fractionation or equilibration with garnet in deep crustal reservoirs , ( 2 ) contamination with deep crustal partial melts , and ( 3 ) fractionation of hornblende ± titanite ± zircon .
Additional factors that affect arc magma fertility are relatively high oxidation states and sulfur content , but these are secondary to the requirement for sufficient water .
The latter parameter ensures that the bulk of the sulfur dissolved in the magma is present in oxidized forms , and the tendency to saturate extensively in sulfide phases , which could remove chalcophile elements from the magma , is low ( Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ) .
Evidence for the voluminous precipitation of amphibole from arc magmas is found in amphibole - rich gabbroic cumulates in lower crustal arc sections of Talkeetna , Alaska ( DeBari and Sleep , 1991 ) , Vancouver Island , Canada ( Larocque and Canil , 2010 ) , Kohistan , Pakistan ( Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ) , and in lower crustal hornblende - ( titanite ) gabbro cumulate xenoliths from Egmont volcano , New Zealand ( Gruender et al . , 2010 ) .
Inset shows progressive increase of La / Yb with SiO2 in the Escondida area , from sub - adakitic dioritic plutons to adakitic values in evolved plutons and mineralized porphyries .
Along with mineralogical evidence for the presence of hydrous phenocryst phases ( hornblende and / or biotite ) , and geochemical evidence for extensive frac - tionation , this parameter is most simply interpreted to reflect high magmatic water content , which results in hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization .
Magmatic water contents > 4 wt percent H2O cause abundant amphibole ( ± gar - net ) fractionation but suppression of plagioclase crystallization at deep crustal levels , resulting in increasing Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios with differentiation , commonly into “adakitic” ranges , but not reflecting slab melting .
However , simi - lar geochemical characteristics are readily developed in normal asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived magmas by fractionation of amphibole and / or garnet , and / or by interaction crustal materials upper plate lithosphere .
In recent years , a number of authors have noted a link between intermediate composition plutonic rocks with relatively high Sr / Y ratios and porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits ( e . g . , Baldwin and Pearce , 1982 , and others cited below ) .
Indeed , Davidson ( 1996 ) has argued that the inevitability of some or all such open - system processes affecting magmas ascending through the lithosphere , and especially continental lithosphere , means that detecting unique source trace element signatures is effectively impossible .
High magmatic water contents are a prerequisite for the shallow crustal emplacement of arc magmas and the subsequent generation of potentially ore - forming subvolcanic magmatic - hydrothermal systems .
Intrusive rocks associated with porphyry Cu deposits in three separate segments of Neo - Tethyan arcs in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan display similar temporal and geochemical characteristics when compared with earlier , barren volcanoplutonic suites from the same regions .
Early and abundant fractionation of hornblende from these hydrous magmas ( Romick et al . , 1992 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; Rooney et al . , 2011 ) preferentially depletes the magma in MREE - HREE and Y , leading to listric - shaped REE patterns and low Y and Yb concentrations that decrease with SiO 2 ( as a measure of fractionation ) .
The porphyry - related suites formed in continental arcs , with thickened crust in the case of the Kerman porphyries ; the Chagai belt evolved from an early ( barren ) island arc to a later ( mineralized ) continental arc .
If this flux of hot magma is maintained , then a large magma complex develops at the base of the crust ( the MASH zone ) , in which fractionation of the mafic magma and mixing with partial melts of crustal lithologic units gives rise to evolved , hybrid calc - alkaline intermediate composition magmas , whose lower density allows them to rise into the upper crust .
Measured 40 Ar / 36 Ar ratios were 280 . 84 ± 0 . 67 % during this work ; thus , a discrimination correction of 1 . 0523 ( 4 AMU ) was applied to measured isotope ratios .
Many of these deposits are relatively small , but larger porphyry and epithermal deposits include Roşia Montanȃ ( Romania ; Manske et al . , 2006 ) , Bor and Majdanpek ( Serbia ; Ciobanu et al . , 2002 ; Lips et al . , 2004 ) , Chelopech ( Bulgaria ; Moritz et al . , 2005 ) , Çöpler ( Turkey ; Imer et al . , 2010 ) , Sungun ( Iran ; Hezarkhani , 2006 ) , Sari Gunay ( Iran ; Richards et al . , 2006 ) , Sar Cheshmeh ( Iran ; Waterman and Hamilton , 1975 ) , Saindak ( Pakistan ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ) , Reko Diq ( Pakistan ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ) , and Qulong ( Tibet ; Hou et al . , 2009 ) .
In all cases , a long - lived mature arc setting is required for these fertile magmatic characteristics to be developed .
Together , these petrologic behaviors result in porphyryrelated rocks having relatively high Sr / Y ratios , which some have misinterpreted as a source characteristic arising from melting subducted oceanic crust ( i . e . , adakites ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Omrani et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .
Further , a sustained magmatic flux from the asthenosphere is required to extend the thermal anomaly of arc magmatism into the upper crust , where large , relatively long - lived batholithic magma chambers and subvolcanic cupolas can develop .
Regional - scale changes in upper - plate stress conditions may also control the commonly observed pulsation of arc magmatism and the spatiotemporal nature of metallogenic belts ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
It was formed during two major orogenic events , one in the earlymid Mesozoic reflecting closure of the Paleo - Tethys ocean , and the second in the early Cenozoic to Recent , reflecting closure of the Neo - Tethys ocean ( Sengör and Yilmaz , 1981 ; Glennie , 2000 ; Ilbeyli et al . , 2004 ) .
This study focuses on a segment of the orogen that runs from central Iran through westernmost Pakistan , where there is a major transition from collisional tectonics ( the Zagros fold - and - thrust belt of southwestern Iran ) to ongoing subduction ( the Makran accretionary complex and Chagai volcanoplutonic belt of southeastern Iran and western Pakistan ) .
It is thus suggested that the fertility of arc magmas within a given arc terrane can be assessed by observing the relative timing of plutonic suites ( later suites are more prospective ) , noting the common presence of hornblende or biotite phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and through lithogeochemical fingerprinting of magmatic fractionation processes ( relatively high Sr / Y ratios , and Eun / Eu * ratios ≈ 1 , indicating abundant early hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization in hydrous magmas ) .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the porphyry magmas and related rocks indicate that they are relatively evolved and fractionated significant amounts of hornblende prior to plagioclase crystallization as a consequence of high magmatic water contents .
These conditions result in progressive temporal changes in arc magmatism toward geochemically evolved andesiticdacitic magmas with high volatile ( especially H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and incompatible element contents , which are the essential starting ingredients for porphyry deposit formation ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Cline , 1995 ) .
A diverse array of mineral deposit types is also associated with the belt , including volcanic - hosted massive sulfide deposits , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au deposits , and low and high sulfidation epithermal Au deposits .
An age of 28 . 02 Ma ( Renne et al . , 1988 ) was used for the Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine fluence monitor in calculating ages for samples .
Computer automated operation of the sample stage , laser , extraction line , and mass spectrometer , as well as final data reduction and age calculations , were done using LabSPEC software written by B . Idleman ( Lehigh University ) .
Re - Os dates on molybdenite are between 89 . 7 and 90 . 4 Ma .
Illite ± kaolinite alteration overprinted potassic and sodic - potassic alteration throughout the deposit and variably redistributed copper and gold .
High - grade copper - gold mineralization is related to advanced argillic alteration controlled by a synhydrothermal brittle - ductile fault zone which overprinted potassic , sodic - potassic alteration in the East zone .
Grade - destructive quartz - sericite - pyrite alteration forms a halo to the entire deposit and yields outward to propylitic alteration .
The large size and high hypogene grades of the Pebble deposit may reflect a combination of multiple stages of metal introduction with vertically restricted , lateral fluid flow induced by hornfels aquitards in flysch .
The Pebble deposit is notable for its size , its high hypogene grade , and because it is the only world - class porphyry deposit thus far discovered in a highly prospective region of south - west Alaska .
Tectonic and structural controls on formation of Pebble The regional and local tectonic and structural controls on the location of Pebble remain poorly understood .
The late , molybdenum - rich type B3 veins plausibly reflect the different compatibilities of molybdenum during advanced fractionation and ac - companying fluid loss in intermediate and felsic magmas ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) .
Porphyry deposits typically contain discrete intra hydrothermal intrusions , which are variably associated with mineralization events ( e . g . , Proffett , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Pebble probably formed at a depth of less than 2 km .
Geochronology of alteration min - erals along with paragenetically well - constrained studies of fluid inclusions and light stable isotopes will be particularly important in determining the temporal and genetic relation - ships between multiple stages of hydrothermal alteration and metal redistribution .
A thin incompletely developed zone of supergene mineralization occurs in the West zone and is overlain by a thin leached capping .
The late advanced argillic alteration introduced additional copper and gold to the East zone and produced the highest grades of mineralization in the deposit .
The Pebble deposit , as currently delineated , has a flat - tab - ular geometry which extends to greater depth primarily along the brittle - ductile fault zone , although the system remains nearly undrilled east of the ZG1 fault .
Most Cu - Au - Mo mineralization is related to early sodic - potassic alteration .
Discrete intrusions related to either early Cu - Au - ( Mo ) or late Cu - Mo - ( Au ) mineralization have not , however , been identified and if present are likely located below the limits of drilling ( Fig . 12B , D ) .
Controls on hypogene grade and deposit geometry The high hypogene grades in the Pebble deposit at least par - tially reflect multiple stages of metal introduction ( Fig . 12 ) .
Variations in hypogene grade and metal ratios reflect multiple stages of metal introduction and redistribution .
The absence of hydrothermal breccias , except within the brittle - ductile fault zone , is compatible with vertical fluid confinement .
The preference of alter - ation sills suggests that the intense hornfels in Kahiltna flysch acted as aquitards and that deposit geometry may reflect a significant component of lateral fluid flow ( Fig . 12B ) , as documented in some porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 1997 ) .
Similarly complex , mid - Late Cretaceous settings in southwest Alaska both currently constitute prospective ground for porphyry exploration .
Regardless of whether intrusions related to the Pebble de - posit are unique , the broader host environment manifests a column of crust that experienced long - lived episodic magma - tism and deep - seated structural activity .
On the east side of the deposit , high - grade mineralization has been dropped 600 to 900 m into the NE - trending East graben , where the deposit remains undelineated to the east and to depth .
The relatively primitive Nd isotope signatures of granodiorite intrusions at Pebble ( Hart et al . , 2010 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) suggest a possible evolu - tionary departure , of unknown potential significance , from that of normal , porphyry - related , felsic to intermediate intru - sions ( e . g . , Seedorf et al . , 2005 ) .
The relatively primitive Nd and Sr isotope signatures of granodiorite intrusions at Pebble ( Hart et al . , 2010 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) suggest a possible evolu - tionary departure , of unknown potential significance , from that of normal , porphyry - related , felsic to intermediate intru - sions ( e . g . , Seedorf et al . , 2005 ) .
It is completely concealed by Late Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary rocks .
This setting is similar to fertile porphyry environments in northern Chile and suggests that southwestern Alaska is highly prospective for porphyry exploration .
One possible scenario comprises an earliest substage of Cu - Au - ( Mo ) mineralization associated with biotite - rich al - teration in the host rocks granodiorite plutons and a later substage of Cu - Mo - ( Au ) mineralization related to K - feldspar - enriched alteration within and proximal to the granodiorite plutons ( Fig . 12B , C ) .
The near - surface paleoexpression of the Pebble deposit re - mains speculative .
Summary of the Geologic Evolution of the Pebble Deposit A provisional magmatic - hydrothermal - structural history of the Pebble deposit has the following major components which are illustrated in the cartoons of Figure 12 : ( 1 ) the Kahiltna flysch was deposited before about 99 Ma , ( 2 ) diorite and granodiorite sills were emplaced into the flysch at about 96 Ma , ( 3 ) the alkalic suite plutons and associated breccias were intruded at about 96 Ma , ( 4 ) the Kaskanak batholith , controlled by regional local extensional structures , was emplaced at about 90 Ma and a wide hornfels aureole formed at its top and margins ( Fig . 12A ) , ( 5 ) intrusions approximately coeval with the Kaskanak batholith may have been emplaced at depth and generated fluids responsible for an early sub - stage of Cu - Au - ( Mo ) mineralization ( Fig . 12B ) , ( 6 ) the ex - posed granodiorite plutons within the Pebble deposit were in - truded at about 90 Ma and were related to both the zones of high quartz vein density and the potentially later substage of Cu - Mo - ( Au ) mineralization ( Fig . 12C ) , ( 7 ) additional molyb - denum mineralization formed in association with type B3 veins as the early stage of alteration and Cu - Au - Mo mineral - ization waned ( Fig . 12C ) , ( 8 ) the entire system cooled and was overprinted by illite ± kaolinite alteration which redis - tributed copper and gold , ( 9 ) additional intrusions were prob - ably emplaced at depth along the brittle - ductile fault zone and generated fluids responsible for advanced argillic alter - ation and its associated Cu - Au mineralization ( Fig . 12D ) , ( 10 ) magmatic - hydrothermal activity ceased , ( 11 ) rapid deposition of the Late Cretaceous Cover sequence ( Kelley et al . , 2012 ) in a very dynamic sedimentary environment , ( 12 ) uplift and erosion of the Cover sequence in the West zone during the late Eocene to early Oligocene , ( 13 ) paleosupergene mineral - ization formed between 8 and 6 Ma , ( 14 ) the entire deposit 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 459 460 LANG ET AL .

The West zone was discovered in 1989 by Cominco America ( Bouley et al . , 1995 ) and contains moderate hypogene grades of Cu - Au - Mo mineralization overprinted by thin , partially developed supergene mineralization .
Detailed geo - logic study combined with dedicated exploration will ulti - mately determine whether Pebble deposits Bingham Canyon , or is only the first major discovery in a highly fertile metallogenic belt .
The 65 zone prospect ( Fig . 2 ; see above ) , although not yet ex - plored to depth , comprises several square kilometres of geo - chemically anomalous , strong to intense quartz - sericite - pyrite and propylitic alteration cut by mineralized breccias with as - sociated potassic alteration and may be a high - level analogue to the scenario proposed for Pebble .
Porphyry deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB )
Subduction and arc building activity on the Paleo - Pacific Ocean margin continued to the Mid Mesozoic as the Indo - Sinian and Yanshanian orogenic cycles ( Seltmann and Porter , 2005 , and references cited therein ) .
Exceptionally large porphyry Cu deposits are the principal exploration targets in the TEMB .
Porphyry Cu - Mo and Cu - Au deposits in this sector are related to Neo - Tethyan subduction .
The mineralization dated at 170 - 135 Ma may have formed within a continental magmatic arc , with widespread magmatism and back - arc extension caused by low - angle subduction of the Paleo - pacific plate .
The porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au - Ag systems in pullapart volcanic - sedimentary basins in the eastern continental margin of China can be ascribed to large - scale lithospheric thinning , delamination and thermal erosion triggered by the changing direction of the Paleo - Pacific plate from oblique to parallel to the continent margin ( Mao et al . , 2007 ( Mao et al . , , 2008 ( Mao et al . , , 2010 ( Mao et al . , , 2013Goldfarb et al . , 2007Goldfarb et al . , , 2013 .
The TEOB is of global size extending approximately for over 10 , 000 km from the western Mediterranean ( northern Africa and eastern Spain ) , across the Alps and Carpatho - Balkans , to SE Europe over the Pontides and the Lesser Caucasus through Iran , western Pakistan , Central and SE Afghanistan , the Hjndu Kush , Southern Pamirs , Karakorum and the Tibet Plateau to Myanmar and Southwest Indonesia , where it joins the Pacific metallogenic belts ( Jankovic , 1986 ; Fig . 1 ) .
The magmas associated with these Cu - Au ( Mo ) deposits show both island arc geochemical signatures and include alkalic compositions , and share similarity with the Skouries porphyry in Greece .
The porphyry Mo and hydrothermal vein type Pb - Zn deposits in the Nianqing - Tanggula area ( or northern Gangdese ) developed in the back arc basin of the continental margin .
The ore formation ages of these porphyry Mo and vein type Pb - Zn deposits range from 65 to 51 Ma ( Gao et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) .
The Three River porphyry Cu belt comprises the Triassic porphyry Cu - Au and Cretaceous porphyry Cu - Mo deposits of the Zhongdian magmatic arc , and the Jinshajiang - Red River Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo deposit belt associated with alkaline igneous rocks .
The Zhongdian magmatic arc is also a significant Triassic porphyry - skarn Cu district in China , hosting several major deposits Chundu , Xuejiping , as well as several smaller and sub - economic occurrences ( Li , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Peng et al . , 2013Peng et al . , , 2014 .
The partial melting subducted oceanic slab largely metasomatized and transformed the arc lithosphere during a long subduction - related tectonic process .
Both porphyry Cu - Mo ( Au ) deposits are common in East China .
Major Cu - Au and Cu - Mo porphyry deposits are distributed over an interval of almost 5000 km across central Eurasia , from the Urals Mountains in Russia in the west , though the Central Asian countries , Mongolia , Xinjiang ( NW China ) , Inner Mongolia and Northeast China to the east ( Seltmann et al . , 2013 ( Seltmann et al . , , 2014Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .
These geochemical signatures suggest that subduction played a dominant role in their petrogenesis and that residual garnet was left in the magma sources .
In the Eurasian continent there are three huge metallogenic belts of Cu and Mo porphyry deposits , comprising the Paleozoic Central Asian Ore Belt in the north , the Tethyan Eurasian Ore Belt of Jurassic to Cenozoic age in the southwest , and the East Margin Ore Belt Eurasian Continent of Jurassic to Cretaceous age in the east .
By the Mid to Late Permian , as the Kazakh Orocline had continued to develop , both the Sakmara and Khanty - Mansi back - arc basins closed and the collage arcs was sutured by accretionary complexes .
In the Pontides - Caucasus sector there are many base , rare and precious metal deposits , but typical porphyry Cu deposits are relatively rare ( e . g . , Kisladag and Copler ; Jankovic , 1977 ; Yigit , 2009 ; Fig . 1 ) .
During the Permian and Triassic , the North China craton approached and docked with the Siberian plate , closing the Mongol - Okhotsk sea ( an embayment on the Paleo - Pacific margin ) to form the Mongolian Orocline .
Age peaks of magmatism occurred at 77 , 85 , and 91 Ma , and porphyry copper deposits formed at 77 , 85 , and between 91 and 80 Ma ( Lips et al . , 2004 ) .
It comprises the Narigongma , Yulong , Mangzong , Malasongduo , Zhalaga and Duoxiasongduo deposits in the north which are dated at 35 . 4 - 36 . 6 Ma ( Du et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) , the Machangqing porphyry and Beiyaskarn Au - Cu - Pb - Zn deposit in the central part have Re - Os ages of 33 - 36 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; He et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the Harbo , Chang ' anchong , Tongchang porphyry Cu - Mo , and O Qyo Ho porphyry Mo deposits in the south have ages of 35 - 34 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) .

There are two types of porphyry copper systems : ( 1 ) porphyryskarn Cu with ages of 175 - 135 Ma , distributed along the Qin - Hang belt , Middle - Lower Yangtze River Valley , Northeast Taihang - Southeast Great Hinggan Range from south to north ; and ( 2 ) porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au with ages of ca .
They are the results of Neotethyan oceanic subduction , collision and post - collisional events during the convergence of India with the Eurasian plate .
The recurrent feature of these ore systems and related felsic rocks is their derivation from partial melting of stagnant or residual oceanic slabs , and mixing with a variable amount of crustal material during magma ascent to shallower levels .
In particular , the key role of postsubduction - related porphyry ore systems is emphasized , comprising collisional Cu - Mo porphyry deposits during the geological history of the Eurasian continent .
100 Ma , which are located in the Cretaceous basins of Shanghang in western Fujian province ( Southeast China ) , Yangchun in western Guangdong province ( South China ) , and Xiaoxinancha in Jilin province ( Northeast China ) .
et al . , 2013a , b ) , and a group of porphyry Mo deposits along the Xilamulunhe area in southeast Inner Mongolia ( 245 - 220 Ma , Zeng et al . , 2013 ; Nie et al . , 2011 ; Jiang et al . , 2011 ) .
Alternatively , Gao et al . ( 2013 ) linked the porphyry Cu - Mo deposits with the destruction of the North China Craton ( NCC ) keel during Late Mesozoic and inferred that the ore - bearing porphyries and associated volcanic rocks have a common parental basaltic magma , derived from partial melting of metasomatized mantle lithosphere beneath the NCC .
Subsequent to subduction , remelting of the residual oceanic slab most likely further metasomatized the arc lithosphere , as described by Richards ( 2009 ) .
The study carried out by Qu et al . ( 2007 ) indicates that the porphyry intrusions responsible for the Cu - Mo deposits in the Gangdese belt are K - enriched and belong to the shoshonitic to high - K calc - alkaline series , characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) Rb , K , U , Th , Sr , Pb and depletion of high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta , Ti and heavy rare earth elements ( HREE ) and Y without Eu anomalies .

At the same time , the Paleo - Pacific Ocean began subducting beneath the Siberian craton to form the Sayan - Transbaikal arc , which by the Permian expanded to become the Selanga - Gobi - Khanka arc , and for a period was continuous with the Kazakh - Mongol arc .
Peng et al . ( 2013Peng et al . ( , 2014 suggest that during the subduction of the Garze - Litang oceanic slab , partial melting mantle wedge above the slab caused the formation of abundant Triassic porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits in the Zhongdian arc .
So far , exploration is concentrated on the Duobuza , Bolong , Nadun , Dibaonamugang , Rongna , Narou and Tiegelong porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au - Cu deposits .
Mao et al . ( 2003bMao et al . ( , 2005Mao et al . ( , 2011aMao et al . ( , 2013 , Sun et al . ( 2010 ) and Ouyang et al . ( 2013 ) have provided comprehensive reviews on the metallogeny and tectonic settings polymetallic deposits in East China .
Lithocaps can have large areal extent ( > 20 km 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) and , because they resist erosion , are typically prominent at the surface , which generally makes them easy to find .
SWIR spectral features of alunite and some trace elements in alunite show indications of sys - tematic variations relative to the Far Southeast porphyry source .
Combining the results alter - ation mineralogy , illite crystallinity , and geochemical anom - alies may improve the targeting of such a vein prospect , despite the anomalies being weak .
Alteration mapping , aided by SWIR equipment , is essential to assess the advanced argillic lithocap environment , as is mapping of lithology and structures .
White mica - pyrite alteration , coupled with various elements of the epithermal suite—both As and Se at Mankayan—may indicate the presence of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins , especially in a district with known porphyry or high - sufidation mineralization or large lithocaps .
The alteration and its subhorizontal geometry indi - cate that it is a lithocap or coalesced lithocaps .
The hypersaline liquid causes the deep potassic alteration , whereas the vapor , being buoyant , ascends toward the surface along structures .
The orebodies are located at deeper positions and relatively close to the intrusive source ( Figs . 1 , 3 ) .
The Victoria and Theresa vein systems can be tentatively re - lated to a zone of probable demagnetization , consistent with the white mica - pyrite alteration .
Lead in alunite is higher in distal positions ( Fig . 10a ) , prob - ably because Pb substitutes for K , as the ionic radius of Pb2 + ( 1 . 32 ) is closer in size to K + ( 1 . 33 ) than to Na + ( 0 . 98 ) .
Zonation in mineralogy and texture At Mankayan , the alteration halo to structural feeders of the Lepanto lithocap and ore deposit are zoned ( Fig . 4 ) , sim - ilar to the classic zonation pattern at the structurally con - trolled Summitville high sulfidation epithermal deposit ( Steven and Ratte , 1960 ) ; the alteration zonation , from struc - ture to margin , commonly has a scale of 10s of meters .
The concealed Victoria epithermal veins consist of intermediate sulfida - tion mineralization on the southwest flank of the porphyry .
In addition to crystal lattice effects , the solubility of these trace elements at different temperatures may also have played a role .
Their contents in alunite have a trend that in - creases near the intrusive center ( Apps .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal and / or porphyry mineralization nearby .
In sum - mary , the geometry unconformity and the spatial distribution of the rock units may have caused the asymmetry of the lithocap .
The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized , alunite - bearing whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .
There is no systematic mineralogical or textural zoning in the Lepanto lithocap that indicates direc - tion to the intrusive source .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
It is critical to locate the structural feeders of lithocaps , as high sulfidation mineralization—if present—is most likely to be concentrated there .
In a district that contains many low magnetic anomalies , those closest to the margin of a large lithocap may deserve priority in follow - up investigation .
To use the vectors , the outcrops of lithocap alter - ation are assumed to be genetically linked .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .

Vectors found in this study include the following : ( 1 ) the alunite peak position at ~ 1480 nm on SWIR spectrum shifts toward higher wavelength in samples that are closer to the intrusive source of acidic condensates ; ( 2 ) in alunite the Pb content decreases closer to the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , La / Pb , and Sr / Pb increase ; ( 3 ) the whole - rock compo - sition alunite - containing , non - mineralized ( < 0 . 1 % Cu and < 100 ppb Au ) lithocap samples can also point to the intrusive source : Hg , Pb , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center .
But not all structurally con - trolled zones of hypogene advanced argillic alteration have as - sociated lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999 ) , either because they did not intersect permeable horizons , or such horizons have subse - quently been eroded .
These patches are probably con - nected by fractures with the main lithocap below and thus constitute perched horizons .
The veins are not exposed , but their presence at depth is indicated by subtle alteration ( illite or interstratified illite and / or smectite or smectite + pyrite ) and geochemical ( As , Se ) anomalies at the surface .
This is consistent with the spatial distribution of the samples relative to the intrusive heat source , with Na - rich samples closest to the Far Southeast porphyry .
Conse - quently , these patterns indicate the direction to the intrusive 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1384 EXPLORATION TOOLS FOR PORPHYRY & EPITHERMAL DEPOSITS , MANKAYAN Cu - Au DISTRICT 1385 source of volatiles .
The subtlety of signatures is strongly dependent on the erosion level ; therefore , even if such indications are not pre - sent at some erosional surfaces , e . g . , > 350 m above the upper extent of veins—similar to those in the Mankayan district— the potential of the district should not be ignored if there are other indications of mineralization potential , e . g . , mineralized fragments in an exposed diatreme , or within 2 to 3 km of a porphyry deposit or lithocap .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits above upper crustal magma chambers represent focused zones o f magma fluid flow , hydrothermal alteration , and mineral precipitat ion of great economic significance ( Dilles et al . , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Porphyry Cu mineralization is generally produced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction o f hypersaline brine and a much larger mass o f low - density vapor either direct ly exsolved from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more likely , generated when a single - phase fluid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .
Liquid - rich inclusions from a boiling assemblage in DL vein have homogenizat ion temperature of ~ 370 °C and salinity o f ~ 6 wt % NaClequiv .
Liquid - rich inclusions in DL veins have higher Cs / K and As / K than other fluid inclusion types in the early - and transit ional - stage quartz veins ( Fig . 12 ) , suggesting that the late - stage fluids are more evo lved than the ore - forming fluids .
The similar metal ratios magmatic sulfides , ore - forming fluids , and ores indicate that these sulfides release their metal load to the ore - forming fluids upon bulk disso lution of the sulfides during magma degassing ( Halter et al . , 2002a ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) .
The DL veins formed from fluids low temperatures ( ≤370 °C ) and low salinity ( 3 - 7 wt % NaClequiv . ) .
The porphyry intrusions with various who le - rock composit ions ( 62 - 72 wt % SiO2 ) contain 19 abundant inclusion - rich apatite ( ~ 27 - 30 % of all apatite ) that occurs commonly as inclusions in phenocrysts ( e . g . , hornblende and biot ite ) .
The fluid inclusion data , however , cannot explain why a relat ively deep Mo - rich mineralizat ion represented by BT veins formed in the transit ional stage ( Fig . 2 ) , as the ore - forming fluids of the early and transit ional stages are very similar in all the analyzed elements ( Fig . 13 ) .
Such fluid–melt inclusion populat ions are argued to represent the transient exsolut ion of ore - forming fluids ( Harris et al . , 2003 ; Rottier et al . , 2016 ) , which is recent ly realized to be problematic as the high Cu concentration in the melt inclusions is an artefact from experimental re - melt ing ( Rottier et al . , 2017 ) .
These coexist ing , highly evo lved melt and fluid inclusions are likely only reflect ive of extreme fract ionation ( Halter et al . , 2005 ; Stefanova et al . , 2014 ) .
The giant Eocene Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in eastern Tibet , China was produced by mult istage veining , Cu - Mo sulfide deposit ion , and hydrotherma l alteration associated with pulsed magmat ic intrusions ( i . e . , early , transit ional , and late stages ) last ing for a prolonged period of t ime .
Although the magmat ic - hydrothermal process associated with porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) mineralizat ion has been extensively studied , the fo llowing quest ions remain not well understood : 1 ) the nature and long - term evo lut ion of source magmas ; 2 ) the main carriers of Cu and Mo and factors governing Cu - Mo decoupling during hydrothermal process ; 3 ) the origin o f the common post - ore pyrite + quartz veins and associated sericit ic alteration .
In addit ion , FIAs in the early - and transit ional - stage quartz veins with obvious features of post - entrapment modification such as defo rmation or decrepitating halos were largely avoided , but several lines o f evidence suggest that the best - preserved ID and brine FIAs still commonly suffered from post - entrapment modification : ( 1 ) the homogenizat ion of some unambiguous bo iling assemblages b y final disso lut ion of halite at much higher temperature than that of bubble disappearance ; ( 2 ) individual ID or brine fluid inclusions in some FIAs show different homogenizat ion behaviors and / or large ranges of homogenizat ion temperature ; and ( 3 ) two thirds of brine inclusion assemblages homogenized to liquid by halite disso lution with a minimum entrapment pressure est imated at up to ~ 3 kbar ( Fig . 10B ; Becker et al . , 2008 ) , whereas the real fluid pressure was likely < 1 kbar ( see below ) .
with ~ 9300 ppm Cu and ~ 330 ppm Mo ) coexist ing with a large amount of vapors ( vapor / brine mass ratio of ~ 4 ) .
The sequent ial deposit ion of Mo and Cu from the condensed brine phase of the early stage caused the local Cu - Mo decoupling at shallow levels o f the deposit , whereas the mechanism that formed the deeply located Mo - rich but Cu - poor mineralizat ion of the transit ional stage is less clear .
However , init ial single - phase ID ore - forming fluids ( see below ) of the early and transit ional stage at Yulong were very similar , because the least differentiated ID and brine inclusions from the two stages are essent ially the same in concentrations of all the analyzed elements ( Fig . 13 ) .
Considering that the brine phase occupy a much smaller volume than the same mass of vapor phase , condensat ion of the high - densit y brine phase from a low - density input fluid and its accumulat ion at the level o f the vapor - brine immiscibility could thus be an efficient mechanism to concentrate Cu and Mo in a small rock volume .
The widespread coeval potassium - rich basalt ic vo lcanic rocks in the Changdu - Simao cont inental block ( Fig . 1A ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) also support the hypothesis that basalt ic to andesit ic magmas played an important role in the format ion of the Yulong deposit .
After the intrusion of QAP , the metal - deficient late - stage fluids that formed the DL veins and associated sericit ic alteration exso lved from highly evo lved rhyo lit ic melts during the so lidificat ion of magma chamber , probably due to the lack of new batches o f input magmas ( Fig . 15C ) .
The input of new batches of andesit ic and / or basalt ic magmas into the long - lived upper crustal magma chamber maintained the repeated exsolut ion of composit ionally similar single - phase ID , metal - charged fluids over a long period of ~ 1 . 4 m . y .
It is thus concluded that most Mo and Cu of the early stage precipitated sequent ially from the brine phase .
Therefore , the precipitat ion of chalcopyrite paragenet ically later than the bulk quartz veins at Yulong suggests that the precipitat ion of most Cu was probably driven by further cooling of the brine phase at pressure close to hydrostatic ( Landtwing et al , 2005 ) .
Consequent ly , the format ion of a late Mo - rich mineralizat ion ( similar to the transit ional - stage mineralizat ion at Yulong ) in many porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 and reference therein ) are likely caused by subso lidus hydrothermal processes rather than the progressive increase of Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and 27 Holland , 1986 ) .
The evidence concerning the behavior of Mo in the two fluid phases is less clear ( Wilkinson et al . , 4 2008 ; Seo et al . , 2012 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2015 ) , despite recent experimental studies suggest that Mo strongly part it ions into brines upon phase separation ( Kokh et al . , 2016 ; Zajacz et al . , 2017 ) .
Therefore , the experimentally determined Cu partitioning coefficient of 0 . 11 - 0 . 15 between vapor and brine ( Lerchbaumer and Audétat , 2012 ) are used for a mass balance calculat ion : using the vapor / brine mass ratio on the order of 4 , the total amount of Cu in the brine phase is about 2 times higher than that in the vapor phase .
Recent experimental studies suggest that the high Cu concentrations in vapor - dominated fluid inclusions in quartz are caused by post - entrapment diffusion , and thus favored that Cu is most ly transported by hypersaline brines ( Lerchbaumer and Audétat , 2012 ) .
The fo llowing two lines of evidence suggest that brines indeed played a significant role at Yulong .
A model that invokes the input of new batches of 22 andesit ic magmas into the magma chamber can well explain the repeated exsolut ion of similar ore - forming fluids during a prolonged period of time ( Annen , 2009 ; Gelman et al . , 2013 ; Tapster et al . , 2016 ) .
A recent experimental study suggests that an increase in CO2 concentration in the fluids to up to ~ 4 mo l % may decrease the so lubility o f Mo as well ( Kokh et al . , 2017 ) .
Similar variat ions ( 0 - 2 wt % SO3 ) have also been documented for apatite from oxidized magmas related to porphyry Cu systems and arc vo lcanos elsewhere ( Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2002 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
The transit ional - stage mineralizat ion , which is mainly represented by BT veins , formed rapidly from 40 . 98 ± 0 . 23 to 40 . 92 ± 0 . 17 Ma .
The second pulse of intermediate - density ore - forming fluids at Questa contained ~ 20 times higher Cs concentration than the first one , observations interpreted to reflect major crystal fract ionat ion of the source magma ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ) .
The prolonged durat ion for the bulk ore format ion at Yulong potentially indicates significant composit ional variat ion of the magmat ic hydrothermal fluids as a result of extended magma fractionation ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .
Middle Jurassic ( 160 - 180 Ma ) intra - plate alkaline basalts and gabbros , bimodal volcanic - intrusive complexes ( Fig . 1b ; Zhao et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c , and Jurassic extensional sedimentary basins ( Gilder et al . , 1996 ) are all observed in this region .
Lower crustal delamination may represent an important process in the differentiation of the continental lithosphere ( Ducea & Saleeby , 1998 ) .
Slab - derived adakitic magmas are more favorable for the generation of Cu - Au deposits than slab - derived CO 2 - or H 2 O - or SO 3 - bearing fluids , owing to their higher Fe 2 O 3 content ( Mungall , 2002 ) .

The Dexing adakitic porphyries exhibit the typical geochemical characteristics of adakites , e . g .
The Nd - Sr isotopic compositions of the Dexing adakites , which are comparable with those of coeval basaltic magmas from the Cathaysia Block ( Li et al . , 2003 ( Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c and to those of adakitic rocks derived by partial melting of newly underplated basaltic lower crust ( Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Muir et al . , 1995 ; Petford & Atherton , 1996 ; Fig . 7a ) , invite speculation that they may have occurred due to partial melting of newly underplated , thickened , lower crust .
high La / Yb , Sr / Y ratios and low Y and Yb contents ( Table 2 ; Figs 4b and 6 ) , suggesting that garnet was stable within the source residues when the adakitic magmas were segregated ( Defant & Drummond , 1990 ; Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Rapp & Watson , 1995 ; Rapp et al . , 1999Rapp et al . , , 2003 .
( b ) Nd model age ( T DM ) vs e Nd ( t ) ¼ 171 Ma for the Dexing adakitic porphyries compared with Proterozoic metamorphic rocks from the Yangtze Block ( Chen & Jahn , 1998 ) , Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of cover strata from the Yangtze Block ( Chen & Jahn , 1998 ) , Proterozoic ophiolites from the northeastern Jiangxi Province ( Li et al . , 1997 ) , Middle Jurassic ( 168 - 178 Ma ) within - plate basalts and gabbros in the Cathaysia Block and 400 - 179 Ma MORB .
As the continental crust at this time was probably over - thickened , as a consequence of Triassic compression in South China ( e . g .
Extensive granitic and intermediate - acid volcanic rocks of Cretaceous and Jurassic age are exposed in East China ( Fig . 1b ) .
Samples of the Dexing adakitic porphyries have relatively high e Nd , suggesting a significant depleted mantle component is involved in their petrogenesis .
As effusive rhyolites and tuffs of the late Jurassic Ehu formation are still preserved in the Dexing area ( Fig . 1d ) , the $10 km thick upper crust cannot have been thinned by surface erosion since the formation of the adakitic rocks .
In addition , A - type granites and alkali gabbro - aegirine syenite suites with ages of 165 - 172 Ma have been reported ( Li et al . , 2003 ) .
These include metamorphic , arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks , and ophiolites .

In addition , the Nd - Sr isotopic signatures of the Dexing adakitic porphyries also confirm that a mantle component probably played a role in their petrogenesis ( Figs 7 and 8 ) .
Model 5 : Partial melting of delaminated lower crust
As a consequence , conduction of heat from the underlying asthenosphere heated both the lithospheric mantle and the source ( delaminated lower crust ) of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 12b ) .
However , their high MgO , Cr and Ni contents as well as low initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr and FeO T / MgO values and high eNd ( t ) values suggest that the adakitic magmas include a significant mantle component , contributed by interaction between the crustal melts and the surrounding mantle peridotite .
They exhibit relatively high MgO , Cr , Ni and Sr contents , high La / Yb and Sr / Y ratios , but low Yb and Y contents , similar to adakites produced by slab melting associated with subduction .
Their high Th contents and Th / Ce ratios , and Middle Jurassic age , argue against an origin from a Neoproterozoic ( $1000 Ma ) stalled slab in the mantle .
However , in this study , new Sensitive High - Resolution Ion Microprobe ( SHRIMP ) zircon geochronology data show that the porphyries were intruded in the Middle Jurassic ( 171 AE 3 Ma ) , synchronous with an extensional tectonic event rather than in a compressional tectonic regime ( Gilder et al . , 1996 ; Zhao et al . , 2001 ; Li et al . , 2003Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c .
Castillo et al . 1999 ) ; ( 3 ) partial melting of mafic rocks in the lower part of a thickened crust ( Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Muir et al . , 1995 ; Petford & Atherton , 1996 ; Xiong et al . , 2003 ) ; ( 4 ) partial melting of a stalled ( or dead ) slab in the mantle ( Pe - Piper & Piper , 1994 ; Defant et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) ; ( 5 ) partial melting of delaminated lower crust Xu et al . , 2002 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2004aWang et al . , , 2004b .
This age is contemporaneous with Middle Jurassic extension within the Shi - Han rift zone , and within - plate magmatism elsewhere in South China , indicating that the Dexing adakitic porphyries were probably formed in an extensional tectonic regime in the interior of the continent rather than in an arc setting .
Consequently , it is possible that partial melting of delaminated lower crust could have generated the Dexing adakitic rocks ; the amount of interaction with the surrounding mantle would directly correlate with the e Nd ( 171 Ma ) of the lower crust .
Following the same calculation as for adakitic magma derived from slab melting ( Mungall , 2002 ) , it is found that 1 g of adakitic melt derived from partial melting of delaminated lower crust could oxidize the same amount of sulfide contained in 160 g of mantle peridotite as an adakitic magma derived from slab melting .
Recently , it has been proposed that the Late Mesozoic magmatism of South China was formed in an extensional tectonic setting rather than above a subduction zone ( Li et al . , 2003 ( Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c .
Thus , it is very difficult to distinguish lower crust - derived adakitic rocks in arc settings from subducting slab - derived adakites that may be contaminated by crustal material during their ascent to the surface ( e . g .
Accordingly , it is still difficult to interpret the Dexing adakitic porphyries as partial melts of a subducted slab stalled in mantle , although we cannot completely rule out this possibility .
However , they are characterized by bulk Earth - like Nd - Sr isotope compositions ( e Nd ( t ) ¼ - 1Á14 to þ1Á80 and ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i ¼ 0Á7044 - 0Á7047 ) , and high Th ( 12Á6 - 27Á2 ppm ) contents and Th / Ce ( 0Á19 - 0Á94 ) ratios , which are different from those of Cenozoic slab - derived adakites .
The starting point of Curve 1 represents the composition of a pure slab melt , which is supposed by Stern & Killian ( 1996 ) .
As there is little geodynamic evidence for the existence of contemporaneous subduction , combined with the observation that the Dexing adakitic porphyries have much lower e Nd ( t ) ¼ 171 Ma ) than those of 400 - 179 Ma MORB ( representing appropriate subducted oceanic crustal protoliths ) and Cenozoic adakites ( Fig . 7 ) , and higher Th contents and Th / Ce ratios than subducted slab - derived adakites ( Fig . 5i and j ) , we conclude that the Dexing adakitic porphyries were unlikely to have been produced by partial melting of subducted oceanic crust in the Middle Jurassic .
Rapp & Watson , 1995 ; Rapp et al . , 1999Rapp et al . , , 2002Rapp et al . , , 2003 have also shown that mafic crustal rocks can melt to produce adakitic liquids at sufficient depths ( > 40 km , i . e .

Apatites from mineral deposits are characterized by higher Ca and correspondingly lower total contents of trace elements that partition onto the Ca sites ( rare earth elements ( REEs ) , Y , Mn , Sr , Pb , Th , and U ) than apatites from unmineralized rocks and carbonatites .
Apatites from worldwide carbonatites have the most fractionated REE distributions with light REE enrichment ( Ce / YbCN = 35–872 ) , high V ( 1 . 6–1 , 466 ppm ) , Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , Ba ( 1 . 8–275 ppm ) , and Nb ( 0 . 4–19 ppm ) contents , the low - est W contents ( 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) , and no significant Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ) .
Apatites from alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the North American Cordillera possess high V contents ( 2 . 5–337 ppm ) , whereas apatites from calc - alkaline porphyry Cu - Au deposits have high Mn contents ( 334–10 , 934 ppm ) and typically large negative Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–1 . 1 ) .
Apatites from iron oxide Cu - Au ( IOCG ) and related Kiruna - type iron oxide - apatite ( IOA ) deposits in Canada , China , and Mexico typically have large negative Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–1 . 5 ) and low Mn contents ( 40–5 , 753 ppm ) .
Apatites from orogenic Ni - Cu , porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia , Au - Co skarn deposits have relatively low abundances of impurity cations .
Regional geochemical surveys that collect heavy indicator minerals ( RIMs ) in drift or drainage samples have proven successful in diamond exploration .
Intermediate rocks have similar to slightly higher P2O5 contents , typically ranging from ~ 0 . 1 to 1 wt % ( Belousova et al . , 2001 ; Campos et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 2011 ) .
Calcium , a large cation , has two structural sites in apatite ( Ca1 and Ca2 ) , which are capable of accommodating high concentrations trace elements , including Na , Mg , Mn , Fe , Sr , Y , Ba , lanthanides ( hereafter referred to as REE ) , Pb , Th , and U .

Apatites from carbonatites are characterized by high Si ( < 0 . 05–1 . 3 wt % ) , V ( < 2–1 , 466 ppm ) , Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , Nb ( < 0 . 4–19 ppm ) , Ba ( 1 . 8–275 ppm ) , and Th ( 1 . 6–661 ppm ) contents , the lowest W ( < 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) contents , strongly LREE enriched REE distribution , positive Ce anomalies ( Ce / Ce * = 1 . 0–1 . 7 ) , and by the lack of Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ; Figs . 4a , 5a ) .
Carbonate melts are characterized by very high P , V , and REE ( LREE - enriched ) abundances ( Nelson et al . , 1988 ; Bell , 1989 , 2005 ; Hammouda et al . , 2010 ; Jones et al . , 2013 ) , explaining the consistently high Sr , Ba , and LREE in apatites from carbonatites .

Igneous apatites from two unmineralized samples associated with clinopyroxene contain less Mg ( generally < 200 ppm ) .
Apatites from W skarns partly overlap with apatites from porphyry Mo deposits in DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 2 space ( Fig . 10a ) , but they are separated effectively from each other in DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 3 space ( Fig . 10b ) .
Apatites from porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia show some of the lowest abundances of most trace elements in this study ( Fig . 3a ) .
Apatites from the subduction - related Kiruna - type deposits tend to have more restricted compositions than those from the postorogenic Wernecke IOCG breccias .
Apatites from Kiruna - type deposits have relatively high Si , and S contents ( Table 4 ) which are correlated as charge compensa - tors ( Fig . 3c ) .
Apatites from some Kiruna - type deposits ( Cerro de Mer - cado and Great Bear ) have the highest As contents ( 929– 2 , 251 ppm ) measured in this study .
Hydrothermal apatites in mineralized rocks generally con - tain relatively low concentrations of elements that partition onto the Ca sites due to relatively low crystallization tempera - tures and resultant decreased mobility of impurity elements .
Apatites from carbonatites are characterized by the high - est Nb ( < 0 . 4–19 ppm ) , high Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , and the lowest W ( < 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) contents .
High Nb , coupled with low W contents , is diagnostic of carbonatitic apatites .
Apatites from porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits show very high Mn contents ( 334–10 , 934 ppm ) and variable , but gen - erally strongly negative , Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–1 . 1 , averaging 0 . 4 ) .
Apatites from Wer - necke IOCG breccia also show much higher Eu / Eu * ( 0 . 3– 1 . 5 ) than those from Kiruna - type deposits .
The crystal structure and chemistry of apatite results in relatively high mineral - melt and mineral - fluid partition coefficients for many trace elements ( Hughes and Rakovan , 2002 ; Pan and Fleet , 2002 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) .

The apatites from the Seabee and Dentonia mines have the lowest ( La / Sm ) CN values ( < 0 . 4 ; Fig . 9d ) , possibly due to the pres - ence of monazite and allanite , which incorporate the LREE over the MREE ( Mahood and Hildreth , 1983 ; Michael , 1988 ) .
The elevated V and S contents , coupled with the relatively low Mn contents ( 122–1 , 611 ppm ; Table 4 ) of these apatites , probably indicate crystallization in an oxidizing environment ( Sha and Chappell , 1999 ; Belousova et al . , 2002 ) .
The very high Sr , LREE , V , Ba , and Nb contents in apatites are attributed to the high abundances of these elements in carbonate melts and related fluids .
The high Mn contents are probably related to Mn - rich fluid responsible for phyllic alteration .
The apatites from MORs can be further discrimi - nated by their relatively high Zr and low Sr contents ( Fig . 7b ) , coupled with their relatively high W contents ( Fig . 4a ; T a e b l 5 .
All apatites from the orogenic Ni - Cu group are from the Jason mine in British Columbia .
The apatites from the three alkalic porphyry Cu - Au depos - its studied here ( Dobbin , Mount Polley , Shiko ) are character - ized by very high V ( < 3–337 ppm ; Table 4 ; Fig . 11a ) , high Sr ( 131–2 , 488 ppm ) , and detectable Si ( < 0 . 05–0 . 43 wt % ) and S ( < 0 . 08–0 . 45 wt % ) contents , and a wide range of Ce / Ce * ( 0 . 87–1 . 71 ) .
The low Ca contents of apatites from Kiruna - type deposits are close to those of apatites from unmineralized rocks ( Fig . 2 ) .
The median apa - tite composition for several Norwegian granite pegmatites , including Li - rich , tourmaline - bearing type , also falls within the mineralized field in Figure 7a and b , reflecting the hydro - thermal origin of these apatite megacrysts ( Belousova et al . , 2002 ) .
The high Na and S contents correlate with relative enrichment in LREE as charge compensators .
The calc - alkaline porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits in this study include one porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Kemess South ) and four porphyry Cu - Mo deposits ( Gibraltar , Highmont , Highland Valley Copper , and Lornex ) , which all share simi - lar lithologies , alteration , and mineral assemblages .
Since apatites incor - porate Mn2 + more readily than Mn3 + or Mn4 + , they tend to be relatively Mn poor in oxidizing environments ( Miles et al . , APATITE TRACE ELEMENT COMPOSITIONS : NEW TOOL FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION 1215 ( a ) ( b ) Carbonatites , phoscorites , and associated ijolites MOR IOCG and Kiruna - type Orogenic Au Orogenic Ni - Cu Epithermal Au - Ag Au - Co , Cu , and Pb - Zn skarns W skarn Alkalic porphyry Cu - Au Porphyry Cu - Au Porphyry Cu - Mo Porphyry Mo Porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia Unmineralized rocks Madagascar apatite standard Fig . 11 .

Also , apatites from porphyry Cu - Au deposits have the highest Yb , and the apatites from alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits have the highest V contents ( Fig . 4 ) .
The very low impurity cation contents of apatites from the porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia deposit are consistent with apatite crystallization from relatively low temperature fluids where cation mobility was restricted .
Unlike the apatites from other unmineralized groups , the apatites from MOR ( the unmineralized group ) have Ca and trace element content levels similar to the apatites from min - eralized groups , most likely because the parental MOR melts are depleted in trace elements .
Additional apatites from different orogenic Ni - Cu deposits are required to confirm these trace element characteristics .
The typical mineral assemblage for Kiruna - type deposits is magnetite ± actinolite ± apatite with apatite serving as the main repository for the REEs .
The unusual geochemistry of some apatites from the Wernecke breccia compared with that of Kiruna - type deposits in our study may reflect a different origin for this deposit , as proposed by Hunt et al . ( 2011 ) .
They exhibit strongly LREE enriched REE distribution ( Ce / YbCN = 35–872 ) , with moderate positive Ce anomalies ( Ce / Ce * = 1 . 0–1 . 7 ) and lack Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ) .
In general , apatites from the mineralized groups have higher Ca and lower total contents of trace elements that par - tition onto the Ca sites ( REE , Y , Mn , Sr , Pb , Th , U ) than apa - tites from unmineralized rocks and carbonatites ( Fig . 3a ) .
The relatively low Sr contents in these apatites are consistent with the Sr depletion in the ore zones ( Olade and Fletcher , 1976 ) .
Compared with Kiruna - type apatites , most apatites from the Wernecke IOCG breccia contain higher Mn and lower LREE , Na , Mg , Si , and S contents .
Compared with Kiruna - type apatites , most apatites from the Wernecke IOCG breccia contain higher Mn and lower S contents .
The latter have higher Mn concentration at the same V and Mg concentra - tions ( Fig . 12b ) and a much wider range of Eu / Eu * values ( 0 . 3–1 . 5 ) than the former ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–0 . 4 ) .
Various types of porphyries Kiruna - type deposits are subdi - vided in subsequent steps .
Discrimination of IOCG and Kiruna - type deposits ( step IIIb , DP4 ) The discrimination diagrams for this step were constructed using apatite data from the Wernecke IOCG breccia and Kiruna - type deposits .
Importantly , the low solubility of P2O5 in silicate melts ( Watson , 1980 ; Nash , 1984 ) commonly results in early apatite crystallization that may continue until late - stage fluid saturation and accompanying metallic mineralization .
For most types of deposits , however , it is impossible to use one or two elements to differentiate one group from all others .
In contrast to the Kirkland Lake Au deposits , which are mid - crustal mesozonal orogenic systems ( Rowins et al . , 1991 ; Robert , 2001 ; Ispolatov et al . , 2008 ) , geological features of the Congress ( Lou ) orogenic Au deposit suggest formation at shallower epizonal depths ( e . g . , Groves et al . , 1998 ) .
In the case of the Congress deposit , the high Mg contents of hydrothermal apatites may reflect the mafic protolith .
Even for individual deposit types where apatites displayed significant variation in trace element contents , the linear discriminant functions derived from the multivariate data successfully minimized differences between the data within the same deposit group while enhancing the contrast between the groups .
However , most of the apatite data from MORs and the unmineralized diorites and granodiorites fall within the field of various ore deposits in the DP diagram ( Fig . 7a ) .
An excep - tion is the apatite from highly altered MORs from the Mid - Atlantic Ridge , which have much lower Zr contents ( mostly below the detection limit ) and elevated Sr contents .
The abundances of these chemical impurities in apatite can be affected by many factors .
Discriminant analysis using Mg , V , Mn , Sr , Y , La , Ce , Eu , Dy , Yb , Pb , Th , and U reveals that apatites from mineral deposits can be distinguished from apatites in carbonatites and unmineralized rocks .
A few data points from the mineralized groups that also fall within the carbonatite field are for one sample from Cripple Creek epithermal Au - Ag and for Den - tonia orogenic Au deposits .
This step dis - criminates apatites from orogenic Ni - Cu , orogenic Au , and undivided IOCG and Kiruna - type deposits .
They attributed the slightly higher Ca con - tents of apatites from altered zones to loss of trace elements during hydrothermal alteration and constraints of closure on analytical data totals to 100 wt % .
Discrimination diagrams for apatites from different ore deposits , showing contours of constant Mahalanobis distance outlining bulk of the data in each group ( step II ; Table 5 ; App .
Table 5 ) to separate these deposits IOCG breccia - type and Kiruna - type groups .
This is due to the relatively lower temperatures and pressures of crystallization , resulting in lower solubilities of many trace elements in most aqueous fluids compared to silicate melts .
This distinguishes them from apatites in the other deposit types .
The abundance of some " trace " elements such as Sr and Mn can be up to 8 . 96 and 7 . 59 wt % , respectively , in natural apatite ( Rakovan and Hughes , 2000 ; Hughes et al . , 2004 ) .
Additional work targeting these rocks will help to refine and further test the novel approaches developed in this study .
Only the published data from the Kiruna - type and por - phyry Cu - Mo deposits are projected into the discrimination diagrams for various deposit types ( steps II and III ) .
The large variations in the size of negative Eu anomalies ( Fig . 9a ) may reflect early plagioclase fractionation or partial melting of source rocks that retained feldspar ( Watson and Green , 1981 ; Piccoli and Candela , 2002 ; Tollari et al . , 2008 ) .
The published apatite compositions for barren syenites and dolerite fall within the mineralized field , overlapping our data from MOR , in the DP1 - 1 vs . DP1 - 2 diagram ( Fig . 7a ) .
Table 4 ; Grimes et al . , 2011 ) contain higher Na , Cl , La , Mn , Sr , and Ce and lower HREE , Y , and Zr than apatites from other MORs .
Table 4 ; Grimes et al . , 2011 ) contain higher Ce and lower HREE , Y , and Zr than apatites from other MORs .
Belousova et al . ( 2002 ) documented very high ( Ce / Yb ) CN in apatites from carbonatites and mantle - derived lherzolites .
In terms of the discriminant functions for general deposit types ( DP2 - 1 - 1 vs . DP2 - 1 - 2 , DP2 - 2 - 2 vs . DP2 - 2 - 3 , and DP2 - 3 - 1 vs . DP2 - 3 - 2 ; step II ; Table 5 ) , the published data from porphyry Cu - Mo and Kiruna - type deposits plot within their corresponding fields ( Fig . 8 ) .
These studies have found gradually decreasing whole - rock Mn and Sr contents from the edge of the ore zone to the core of orebody , coincident with the potassic and phyl - lic alteration zones .
Discrimination diagrams are used to subdivide the apatites by origin and the results indicate that apatite is a robust indicator mineral for exploration .
These coefficients are applied to logarithms of the concentration values , and all the DPA functions are calculated similarly to the equation ( 9 ) ( App .
Below we discuss the three - step DPA results based on the apatite data from known deposits comprising our training dataset .
However , where projected using the discriminant functions for porphyries and skarns ( DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 2 and DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 3 ; Table 5 ) , only about half of the data from the porphyry Cu - Mo deposit are classified cor - rectly as apatite from a porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , with a few data points falling within the alkalic porphyry Cu - Au field and the rest of the data straddling the boundary between the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au and the porphyry Mo fields ( Fig . 10 ) .
Con - sequently , primary clinopyroxene and biotite have relatively high Mg / Fe ratios due to the low Fe2 + / Fe3 + in the magma , which results in the substitution of Mg2 + for Fe2 + in primary ferromagnesian silicates .
For example , Sha and Chappell ( 1999 ) recognized that depletion in LREE and Th in apatite from S - type and felsic I - type granitoids was due to the occurrence of monazite , whereas its absence in mafic I - type granitoids produced an enrichment of these elements in apatite .
The proposed discrimination diagrams do require further testing with apatite data from known deposits .
Discriminant functions DP1 - 1 vs . DP1 - 2 ( Fig . 7a ) separate most of the apatite data from carbonatites , various mineral - ized systems , and the unmineralized rocks .
Bouzari et al . ( 2011 ) have undertaken preliminary studies of RIMs associated with porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits and proposed that apatite , rutile , titanite , and magnetite are potential porphyry indicator minerals .
Variables are log10 - equivalents of element concentrations in ppm for all elements , except for Mg , which is in wt % .
Moreover , scaled contributions from individual variables identify critical elements in discrim - inating apatites from different deposits , which may not be otherwise apparent from the multi - element data .
For example , previous studies ( Watson and Green , 1981 ; Fleet and Pan , 1997 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) have shown that the mineral - melt partition coefficients of REE in apatite increases with increasing melt SiO2 content and decreases with increasing temperature .
Therefore , we see no reason why the proposed discrimination approach should not work globally in addition to being a particularly useful exploration tool in glaciated terrains of the North American Cordillera .
Early Paleozoic large scale porphyry - type mineralizat ion in the Kazakhstan metallogenic province is int imately associated with the evolut ion of the Central Tianshan–Yili–Northern Tianshan–Kokchetav–Chingiz Paleozoic arc system which was terminated by the late Permian closure of the western segment of the Paleo - Asian Ocean .
Gold - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) occur in more primitive intra - oceanic arc settings ( e . g . , SW Pacific ) and porphyry Cu deposits in more mature continental arc environments ( e . g . , Central and Northern Chile ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Müller and Groves , 2000 ; Sillitoe , 1997 ) .
Porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits predominantly occur in the western segment of the CAMD , while porphyry Mo deposits ( PMDs ) rather occur in the east ( Fig . 2 ) .
The highly deformed and metamorphosed Precambrian terranes in the Kazakhstan province are believed to be sandwiched between Paleozoic island arcs and accretionary wedges ( Kröner et al . , 2012 ( Kröner et al . , , 2013 .
Precambrian crystalline rocks have been documented to occur in the Tuva - Mongolia microcontinents of the Mongolia metallogenic province ( Fig . 5 ; Demoux et al . , 2009a , b ) .
Dominating orogenic events of the CAMD
Precambrian rocks were interpreted as basement slices that had rifted off the margins of the Siberian and East European cratons .
Coeval intra - oceanic or continental arc - type magmatism occurred widespread within this collage system as evidenced by ca .
Devonian - Carboniferous arc - type granitoid rocks coming from the Western Junggar terrane ( Cao et al . , 2014c ( Cao et al . , , 2016Geng et al . , 2009 ; Tang et al . , 2012a ) , the Balkhash - Chingiz arc terrane of Central Kazakhstan of the northern limb ( Heinhorst et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2016a , b ) , the Middle - Northern Tianshan arc terrane ( Alexeiev et al . , 2016 ; Glorie et al . , 2010 ; Heinhorst et al . , 2000 ; Konopelko et al . , 2008 ) and the Yili - Central Tianshan - Beishan arc terrane of the southern limb ( Ao et al . , 2016 ; Gao et al . , 2009 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) continuously accumulated on this ' oroclinal arc ' .
The huge continental arc , usually referred to as Tuva - Mongolian arc ( Kröner et al . , 2007 ; Sengör and Natal ' in , 1996 ; Sengör et al . , 1993 ) , may have started to form around the Tuva - Mongolia microcontinental nuclei , whereas the South Gobi microcontinentseparated from this arcoccurred as isolated arc in the ocean ( Fig . 7 ; Xiao et al . , 2015 ) .
MORB - type metapelites in the Tsakhir Uul accretionary wedge , which was thrusted onto the Dzabkhan - Baydrag microcontinent in SW Mongolia , have a metamorphic age of 548 Ma , indicating that subduction continued in the Early Cambrian ( Figs . 5 and 7 ; Stipska et al . , 2010 ) .
Triassic PMDs ( 250 - 220 Ma ) exposed along the EW - trending Xilamulun fault were interpreted to be related to post - collisional crustal extension following the final closure of the Paleo - Asian Ocean ( Table1 ; Shu et al . , 2015 ; Zeng et al . , 2015a ) .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems which occur above subduction zones in continental arcs .
Mineralized intermediate to acidic intrusions associated with the giant porphyry Cu ( - Au - Mo ) deposits of the CAMD usually include equigranular to porphyritic tonalites and granodiorites , most of which have kilometer - scale alteration zones similar to those of the classic PCDs in the Circum - Pacific and Tethyan metallogenic domains ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2014 ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2010 .
Porphyry Mo deposits
The unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) represented by comb - quartz layers , alternating , crenulated layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyries were formed at the magmatic to hydrothermal transition ( e . g . , Jin et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2017a ) .
Boiling of highly oxidized fluids caused by sudden release of pressure may have played an important role in triggering molybdenite deposition ( Cao et al . , 2017b ; Xiong et al . , 2016 ; Zhou et al . , 2015b ) .
The MASH model ( Fig . 15a ) can explain the formation of several giant PCDs ( e . g . , the Duobaoshan Cu - Mo , Oyu Tolgoi Cu - Au and Kal ' makyr u - Au deposits ) since all of them have calc - alkaline to high - K calc - alkaline / shoshonitic compositions without an adakitic signature .
Subduction processes are thought to be responsible for the enrichment of metals ( Cu , Au ) and S ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ) and the relative increase of high H 2 O contents in arc magmas ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , which are critical to the formation of PCDs .
A slab - window environment is well suited to promote the genesis of an oxidized adakitic magma saturated with S - metal - rich and oxidized aqueous fluids ( cf .
Porphyry Mo deposits ( PMDs ) are spatially , temporally and genetically related to felsic , high silica and strongly differentiated granitic plutons ( Figs . 10c and 16 ) , similar to those of the Climax - , Endako - and Dabie - type PMDs ( e . g . , Bao et al . , 2017 ; Li and Pirajno , 2017 ) .
The Dabie - type Baishan and Donggebi Mo deposits ( Chen et al . , 2017b ) were formed during syn - collisional crustal shortening and thickening to post - collisional or intracontinental crustal extension and thinning subsequent to the closure of the Paleo - Asian ocean ( Wu et al . , 2017b ) .
PMDs in the Northeast China metallogenic province are subdivided into three subtypes : the collision ( Dabie ) , rift types ( Chen et al . , 2017b ) .
A tonalitic intrusion with a zircon U - Pb crystallization age of 785 ± 11 Ma intruded the early Precambrian crystalline basement of the Tuva - Mongolia microcontinent ( Kuzmichev et al . , 2001 ) .
The formation of high - sulphidation epithermal gold deposits ( 108 - 106 Ma ) and gold - rich porphyry copper deposits ( 111 - 109 Ma ) in the Yanbian area of NE China may also be the result of the Cretaceous subduction of the Paleo - Pacific Ocean ( e . g . , Chai et al . , 2015 ) .
The core region typically comprising the earliest potassic alteration zone ( biotite - K - feldspar - quartz ) , grading outward into the subsequent phyllic ( quartz - sericite - pyrite ) , argillic ( quartz - kaolinite - montmorillonite ) and propylitic alteration zones ( epidote - chlorite - calcite ) .
The rhenium content of molybdenite from the PMDs exposed in the Zhangguangcai Range varies from 0 . 2 to 99 . 7 ppm , also suggesting that ore - forming material may have come from a crustal source or a mixed crustal / mantle source ( Zhang et al . , 2015a ) .
The CAMD ( or CAOB ; Fig . 2 ) , consisting mainly of island arcs , accretionary wedges , oceanic islands and microcontinents , is believed to have been formed by multiple subduction and accretion events related to the evolution of the Paleo - Asian Ocean subsequent to the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia ( e . g . , Gao et al . , 2015 ; Kheraskova et al . , 2010 ; Sengör et al . , 1993 ; Wilhem et al . , 2012 ; Windley et al . , 2007 ; Xiao et al . , 2010 ) .
The porphyry - type mineralization in the Mongolia porphyry Cu - Au metallogenic provinces was interpreted as a result of orogenic processes related to the eastern Altaids ( e . g . , Yakubchuk , 2004 ; Yakubchuk et al . , 2005 ; Zeng et al . , 2015a ) .
Two giant porphyry copper deposits ( Oyu Tolgoi and Tsagaan Suvarga ; Table 1 ; Figs . 2 and 8 ) were generated in the South Gobi arc at ca .
The Jurassic and Cretaceous PMDs are widely distributed in the Xing ' an , Songliao and Jiamusi terranes of the eastern segment of the CAMD ( Figs . 2 and 4c ; Table 1 ) and may be associated with the subduction of the Paleo - Pacific Ocean and the lithospheric delamination caused by rollback of the oceanic plate , respectively ( Shu et al . , 2016 ; Zeng et al . , 2015a , b ; Zhang et al . , 2015a ) .
The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of quartz from the hydrothermal stage quartz veins vary slightly for each porphyry molybdenum deposit , but display a large range for different deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
The associated porphyries are usually hydrous ( > 4 wt . % H 2 O ) calc - alkaline magmas , which were derived from an asthenospheric mantle wedge fertilized by slab fluids in arc settings ( Richards , 2003 ) , high - K calc - alkalic magmas formed by remelting of previously subduction - modified arc lithosphere in post - subduction settings ( Richards , 2009 ) or hydrous , relatively oxidized and high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic magmas with adakitic geochemical affinities in syn / post - collisional zones ( Hou and Cook , 2009 ; Hou et al . , 2003a ) and intra - continental settings ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
The melting model ( Fig . 15b ) , however , was also employed to explain the formation of some PCDs in the CAMD , such as the Bozshkol , Tuwu - Yandong deposits .
The re - melting of sulphide - bearing metal - rich cumulates at the base of the crust during the former underplating process associated with arc magmatism ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2012 ) may have provided abundant metals and S for post - subduction or collision - related PCDs in the CPMD and TMD , respectively ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2015 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
These magmatic events have been associated with the formation of a series of porphyry deposits ( for example , the giant Kal ' makyr Cu - Au , Oyu Tolgoi Cu - Au , Kounrad Cu - Au , Duobaoshan Cu - Mo and Chalukou Mo deposits ) with multi - stage metallogenic ages varying from the Early Ordovician to the Late Cretaceous ( Heinhorst et al . , 2000 ; Seltmann and Porter , 2005 ; Yakubchuk , 2004 ; Yakubchuk et al . , 2005 ; Zeng et al . , 2015a ; Shen et al . , 2015a ; Xue et al . , 2016 ) .
In the Late Paleozoic , the Kazakhstan orocline probably attained its U - shaped structure through oroclinal bending confining the Kokchetav terrane as the core region ( Figs . 5 and 8a ) , the Chingiz arc as the northern limb , which extends almost to the Erqis fault in the north , and the Northern Tianshan - Yili - Central Tianshan - Beishan arc terrane as the southern limb ( Xiao et al . , 2010 ( Xiao et al . , , 2015 .
Numerous granitoid plutons with zircon U - Pb ages varying from 391 Ma to 300 Ma and Carboniferous bimodal volcanic rocks formed in a back - arc setting suggest the formation of the Devonian - Carboniferous arc in this microcontinent ( Kröner et al . , 2017a ; Wainwright et al . , 2011 ; Zhu et al . , 2014aZhu et al . , , 2016 .
Whereas , intensive serpentinization correlates with a fluid flux increase and leads to more oxidizing conditions and the formation of hematite ( e . g . , Alt et al . , 2013 ; Beard and Hopkinson , 2000 ) .
However , oceanic crust may have been entrapped in the Junggar region during the transformation of accretionary to oroclinal tectonics in the Late Paleozoic ( Carroll et al . , 1990 ) .
Whereas , some PMDs - related porphyries in the Xilamulun suture zone region of the northern margin of the North China craton ( e . g . , the Chehugou deposit ; Shu et al . , 2015 ) and in the Zhangguangcai Range of the Jiamusi terrane ( e . g . , the Xingwen deposit ; Zeng et al . , 2017 ) have negative whole - rock ɛ Nd ( t ) values ( Table 2 ; Fig . 17b ) , indicating that an old crustal component has also been involved in the genesis of the ore - forming magmas .
Thus , the mineralization directly related to the MASH process may only occur in those arc segments where relatively oxidized fluids were transferred and further transported into the upper mantle wedge .
The popular MASH ( melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ) model can explain the genesis of both the normal calc - alkaline and the distinct adakite - like arc rocks having the potential to form PCDs ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Yet , these metallogenic domains are hardly discussed even in ' up - to - date ' publications ( cf . , Arndt et al . 2017 ) nor is it known whether the current petrogenetic and metallogenic models proposed for the PCDs in the Cenozoic subductional arc setting and the collisional environment are also suitable for the Paleozoic to Mesozoic porphyry deposits in the Central Asian metallogenic domain ( CAMD ) .
In addition , re - melting of lower crustal sulfide - bearing Cu - rich cumulates formed during the early subduction may have been triggered by crustal thickening and / or subsequent slab break - off , resulting in the formation of giant Miocene PCDs in the Himalayan - Tibetan orogeny of the Tethyan metallogenic domain ( Hou and Cook , 2009 ; Hou et al . , 2003aHou et al . , , 2015Yang et al . , 2015 ) .
In general , early Paleozoic collisional events during the accretionary orogenic process were recorded along the Kazakhstan collage system ( Figs . 5 and 7 ) from the Western Junggar , the Kokchetav , the Central Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Middle - Northern Tianshan to the Beishan arc terranes .
Although the subductional system was kicked off in the Early Cambrian and lasted to the Early Triassic , only ca .
Furthermore , adakitic magmas produced by melting of subducting young oceanic crusts in ' hot ' subduction zones have also been proposed to be an important source for metals in giant PCDs of the Circum - Pacific metallogenic domain ( Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Thieblemont et al . , 1997 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
In addition , porphyry Mo mineralization like the Suyunhe deposit formed at ~ 294 Ma in the West Junggar belt of NW China Cao et al . , 2017b ) .
Regarding the MASH process , arc magmas and associated PCDs are sparsely and eventually evolved products that are generally derived from a fertilized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Richards , 2003 ; Zellmer et al . , 2015 ) .
Data sources : CPMD data from Arnott , 2003 ; Hollings et al . , 2011 ; Pollard et al . , 2005 ; Richards et al . , 2001 ; Schrader , 2001 ; Stern et al . , 2011 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; TMD data from Hou et al . , 2015 ; Moritz et al . , 2016 ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2012 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2014b , c ; Yang et al . , 2015 ; CAMD data from the references listed in Table 1 .
Nevertheless , most of the porphyrit ic suites associated with the Mo deposits in the Northeast China metallogenic province have relat ively depleted mant le - like neodymium and hafnium isotopic composit ions , suggesting that the ore - forming granit ic magma may have predominant ly been derived from juvenile lower crust s . Upwelling of asthenosphere may have triggered the melt ing of the lower crust during post - collisional extension subsequent to the closure of the Paleo - Asian Ocean in the Triassic , the subduct ion of the Paleo - Pacific ocean in the Jurassic and the thinning of the lithosphere caused by rollback of the Paleo - Pacific plate in the Cretaceous .
On the basis of metal reserves , metallogenic ages and tectonic configurations , the CAMD is further subdivided into three metallogenic provinces : the Kazakhstan porphyry Cu - ( Au - Mo ) , the Mongolia porphyry Cu - ( Au ) and the Northeast China porphyry Mo - ( Cu ) metallogenic provinces ( Fig . 2 ) .
In general , the porphyries hosting Mo deposits in the CAMD have relatively depleted strontium isotopic compositions , compared to those in the Qinlin - Dabie collisional orogenic belt and the North China craton ( Table 2 ; Figs . 17a and b ) .
440 Ma ) and the Ordovician Taldy Bulak ; 1 ; Fig . 4a ) .
In general , the porphyry Mo deposits of the CAMD have alteration zones similar to those of the classic porphyry copper deposits ( e . g . , Cao et al . , 2017a , b ; Jin et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2017a ; Zhou et al . , 2015b ) , comprising outward grading potassic , silicic - phyllic , argillic alteration zones ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Furthermore , the intrusions related to gold - rich Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in the CAMD are mainly of dioritic , granodioritic and quartz monzodioritic compositions and have major element compositions that are broadly similar to those of the CPMD and TMD porphyries ( Fig . 10a ) .
Furthermore , the porphyry intrusions in the CAMD have distinct radiogenic strontium , neodymium and hafnium isotopic compositions ( Figs . 13 and 14 ) .
Furthermore , most porphyry deposits including giant world - class deposits , such as El Teniente , Chuquicamata , Bingham , Lepanto - FSE , Grasberg , Kal ' makyr and Oyu Tolgoi , occur in a series of relatively narrow extensive metallogenic domains : the Circum - Pacific , the Tethyan and the Central Asian metallogenic domains ( Fig . 1 ; Rui et al . , 1984 ; Tu , 1999 ) .
The invo lvement of highly oxidized intermediate to acid magmas is fundamental for the format ion o f porphyry deposits .
Althoughin terms of ore reservesrather small Archean and Proterozoic porphyry deposits occur in Fennoscandia and Canada ( Fraser , 1993 ; Wanhainen et al . , 2003 ) , the global spatial distribution of porphyry deposits generally outlines the Phanerozoic orogenic belts resulting from subductional and collisional events along convergent plate margins ( Hou et al . , 2011 ( Hou et al . , , 2015John et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
This is because the archipelago system ended before the Early Triassic and there is no direct evidence for the subduction of former aseismic ridges .
It probably ended in the mid - Jurassic , as evidenced by a 172 Ma granitic batholith that intruded the major Muron shear zone ( Tomurtogoo et al . , 2005 ) and the 172 Ma mylonitized Ereendavaa granite ( Miao et al . , 2017 ) .
330 - 315 Ma along the Balkhash - Western Junggar metallogenic belt ( Figs . 8a and 15c ) .
This commonly includes a cyclical water enrichment of magmas in the deep crust , sulphide saturation of the magma , an efficient transfer of metals into hydrothermal fluids exsolved from the magmas as well as the precipitation of mineralization in suitable structures near the paleo - surface ( e . g . , John et al . , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
These authors undertook a quantitative oxygen mass balance calculation on the oxygen fugacity and the redox state of the subducted oceanic crust , and came to the conclusion that at eclogite - facies depths , relatively reduced fluids with low oxygen fugacities are common , while fluids with increased oxygen fugacities are abundant at shallower levels in the subducting oceanic crust .
Furthermore , to the east , the accretionary orogenesis in the Beishan arc terrane is still under discussion while some workers believe that it may have lasted until the early Triassic ( Tian et al . , 2015 ) others suggest a Permian collision ( e . g . , Xiao et al . , 2004 ) .
The fluid composition of the inclusions is rather consistent in the different deposits .
Therefore , it is thought that dehydration of subducted serpentinites should liberate highly oxidized aqueous fluids and , thus , may increase the oxidation state of the sub - arc mantle ( e . g . , Alt et al . , 2012Alt et al . , , 2013Debret et al . , 2014Debret et al . , , 2015Debret and Sverjenski , 2017 ) .
The occurrence of many of the world ' s largest P Ds in Tertiary to Quaternary magmatic arcs within regions of the CPMD , from which the subduction of oceanic plateaus , and seamount chains was reported , leads to speculation on the importance of these aseismic ridge as tectonic triggers for porphyry - style mineralization ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
Some of intrusions such as the Bozshkol and the Aktogai deposits display adakitic geochemical signatures ( Fig . 11c ) , which are overlapping those of the CPMD and TMD porphyries in the SiO 2 - MgO discrimination diagram and the Sr / Y - Y plot , respectively ( Figs . 11a , b , c and 12 ) .
Thus , it is suggested that the Erguna , Xing ' an and Songliao terranes may have drifted to the north from a peri - Gondwana position close to Australia , along with the Tarim and North China cratons within the Paleo - Asian Ocean ( Figs . 7 and 8a ) , resembling the ' Jiamusi block ' ( Wilde et al . , 1999 ( Wilde et al . , , 2000 ( Wilde et al . , , 2003 .
Thus , it is suggested that the Erguna , Xing ' an and Songliao terranes may have drifted to the north from a peri - Gondwana position close to Australia , along with the Tarim and North China cratons within the Paleo - Asian Ocean ( Figs . 7 and 8a ) , resembling the ' Jiamusi block ' ( Wilde et al . , 1999 ( Wilde et al . , , 2000 ( Wilde et al . , , 2003 .
There is a general agreement that magmatic arc activity including porphyry intrusions are generated by melting in the overlying metasomatized mantle wedge , triggered by addition of ' fluids ' derived from the subducting slab during increasing temperatures and pressures ( e . g . , Klemd , 2013 ; Richards , 2013 ) .
Furthermore , the large size of the giant deposits usually requests further specific " enrichment " factors , such as distinct tectonic characteristics , reactive host rocks and / or focused fluid flow , all of which may lead to enhanced enrichment processes ( Richards , 2013 ) .
This is evidenced by a giant 485 Ma porphyry copper deposit ( Liu et al . , 2012a ; Zeng et al . , 2014a ) formed in the Duobaoshan arc that is situated in the northern segment of the Xing ' an Terrane ( Figs . 6 and 7 ; Table 1 ; Wu et al . , 2011a ; Zeng et al . , 2015a ) .
The 445 Ma peak metamorphic age of an eclogite block occurring with various ophiolites , volcanics and sedimentary rocks in serpentinite mélanges of the Chara zone in Central Kazakhstan also suggests an intense accretionary - collisional event in the Early Paleozoic ( Fig . 5 ; Volkova et al . , 2016 ) .

This is supported by the formation of a huge Devonian volcanic belt in Central Kazakhstan ( Abrajevitch et al . , 2007 ) .
2 . 41 - 2 . 31 Ga were identified in the Baydrag terrane of the Dzabkhan microcontinent ( Demoux et al . , 2009a ; Kozakov et al . , 2007 ) .
As pointed by Cooke et al . ( 2005 ) , the formation of porphyry Cu - ( Mo , Au ) deposits is dominated by various factors such as the tectonic perturbation , architecture of the upper crust , source magma composition , efficient processes of deposition and formation as well as preservation of supergene enrichment covers .
Although all of the factors are important , sulphide saturation of the magma was thought to be the most important one ( e . g . , Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
The following facts support this model : ( 1 ) Although arc magmatism lasted from ca .
Two contrasting models have been proprosed for the tectonic evolution of Northeast China considered to be the eastern part of the CAOB : the " combined NE China block " ( e . g . , Wilde , 201 ; Xu et al . , 201 b ; Zhou and Wilde , 2013 ) and the " Phanerozoic accretionary and arc complexes with minor Precambrian basement rocks " models ( e . g . , Wu et al . , 2011a ; Xiao et al . , 2003 ) .
Here , we present a modified model that telies on ' pre - enriched mafic lower crust and subduction of relictic mid - oceanic ridges ' ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) and may explain the large - scale copper mineralization mechanism of the Balkhash - Western Junggar metallogenic belt in the western segment of the CAMD ( Fig . 15c ) .
The > 1300 km long Late Pan - African ( ~ 500 - 490 Ma ) khondalite belt ( ' NE China Khondalite Belt ' ; Fig . 6 ; Zhou and Wilde , 2013 ; Zhou et al . , 2011 ) and coeval granitoid intrusions ( Ge et al . , 2005 ( Ge et al . , , 2007aMiao et al . , 2017 ; Sui et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2005Wu et al . , , 2011a may have also resulted from a subductional process in an arc setting .
Here , we favor the latter model especially regarding the porphyry - type mineralization in the NE China province since recent age dating results revealed that most of the high - grade metamorphic rocks , formerly suggested to represent the Precambrian basement of blocks , are in fact of Paleozoic age and have arc - protolith affinities ( e . g . , Miao et al . , 2004Miao et al . , , 2007Miao et al . , , 2015aMiao et al . , , 2017Zhou et al . , 2009 ) .
In the central and southern Gobi area of South Mongolia , several ophiolites [ the 528 - 503 Ma Biluutiin Ovoo ( Zhu et al . , 2014b ) , the 509 - 482 Ma Manlay ( Zhu et al . , 2014a ) and the 528 - 519 Ma Namdain ophiolites ( Zhu et al . , 2016 ) ] indicate that the paleo - ocean was also associated with the South Gobi microcontinent .
Recently , Li et al . ( 2016c ) conducted a detailed and systematic petrological study of sulphides and related Fe - Ti oxides which occur in subduction - related blueschists , micaschists and associated HP veins from the Akeyazi ( U ) HP terrane ( Chinese Tianshan ) .
However , more recently , Kröner et al . ( 2017a ) proposed the absence of excessive crustal growth during the ca .
However , it is difficult to evaluate the mechanisms concerning the formation of PCDs in the CAMD .
Furthermore , the Erguna , Xing ' an , Songliao and Jiamusi / Khanka ' blocks ' subsequently rifted off the Sayang - Baikal belt , drifted in the Paleo - Asian Ocean and re - united at the end of the Paleozoic ( e . g . , Wilde , 2015 ) .
However , this interpretation is in contradiction with the paleogeographical and paleomagnetical data , which suggest that Siberia underwent large - scale clockwise rotations of ∼ 50 • from the Cambrian to the Late Permian - Early Triassic ( Cocks and Torsvik , 2007 ; Domeier and Torsvik , 2014 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ) .
Oxidation state of arc magmas
Redox effects on metallogeny during partial melting and magmatic differentiation
Arc magmas are rich in sulfur relative to most other mantle - derived magmas , and this has been referred to as the - excess sulfur‖ problem by some authors ( e . g . , Sharma et al . , 2004 ; Wallace , 2005 ) , reflecting the much larger volumes of SO 2 emitted from some arc volcanoes than would be predicted from the solubility of S in co - erupted felsic lavas .
oceanic crust , and are associated with few magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits .
disseminations sulfides in cumulate and plutonic rocks , and might not indicate significant depletion of Cu in the residual magmas that reach the upper crust .
Fractional crystallization and devolatilization
Reduction by this process is argued to cause reduction of soluble and abundant sulfate to less soluble sulfide , leading to saturation of the magma in sulfide melt and / or minerals , and consequent depletion of the magma in metals .
Cr - and Ti - rich spinels have lower Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios than magnetite ( due to substitution of Ti 4 + and Cr 3 + for Fe 3 + ; Waychunas , 1991 ; Stamper et al . , 2014b ) , and their crystallization would therefore tend to cause an increase Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratio in moderately oxidized primitive to intermediate composition magmas ( i . e . , oxidation ) rather than a decrease .
Deeply emplaced magmas ( ~ 2 kb ) exsolve a relatively saline fluid after ~ 60 % crystallization , which can efficiently scavenge chloride - soluble metals such as Cu from the residual magma ( see also Candela , 1992 ; Cline , 1995 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Huber et al . , 2012 ) .
Gold may also precipitate with these sulfide minerals ( Simon et al . , 2005 ) , and / or may stay in solution to lower temperatures as bisulfide or chloride complexes , potentially to be precipitated in the geothermal / epithermal environment ( Hedenquist et al . , 1993Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2014a ) .
( MORB ) , and have generally concluded that there is little difference in the compositions of primitive magmas from these distinct tectonic settings ( Jenner et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , although Timm et al . ( 2012 ) found that some mafic rocks from the Kermadec arc extend to higher Cu contents than MORB .
For mature and island arc suites , the overriding trend of the data seems to be towards decreasing Cu contents with differentiation ( decreasing MgO content ) , and the scatter to higher values appears more random .
In combination sulfur fugacity of magmatic systems plays a critical role in the behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals .
This flux of sulfate may be the main vector for oxidation of the mantle wedge ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Evans and Tomkins , 2011 ; Alt et al . , 2012 ; Jégo and Dasgupta , 2014 ) .
These magmas are also characteristically depleted Ta , and Nb due to their low mobility in slab fluids and / or retention in restite phases ( Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Foley et al . , 2000 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Thus , sulfide minerals or melts may be stable even in quite oxidized melts if fS 2 conditions are high ( Jugo , 2009 ) , which is a characteristic feature of arc systems .
Although Cu scatters to elevated values in some intermediate composition samples , the bulk of the data show a steady but gentle trend to lower concentrations with differentiation , reaching modal values of ~ 50 - 100 ppm in andesitic rocks .
However , magnetite does not appear suddenly on the cotectic during magmatic differentiation ( i . e . , as a - crisis‖ ) , but rather appears as a late - crystallizing end - member of the spinel solid - solution series , starting with Crspinel in primitive basaltic magmas , followed by Ti - magnetite in andesites , and magnetite in dacites ( e . g . , Macdonald et al . , 2000 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ; Spandler et al . , 2003 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Richards et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant and Macdonald , 2007 ; Zimmer et al . , 2010 ; Tollan et al . , 2012 ; Nandedkar et al . , 2014 ) .
considered Cu - undepleted but Au - PGE - depleted , rather than Cu - rich , and may be typical of normal arc environments where several hundred to a few thousand ppm S may be present ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Jugo , 2009 ) .
In summary , Cu contents of arc magmas globally show a general weak trend of decreasing concentration with differentiation , with a scatter to higher concentrations in some intermediate composition rocks .
other hand , segregation of sulfide melts and minerals will strongly partition chalcophile and siderophile elements , and if large volumes of sulfide are fractionated they will strongly deplete the magma in these metals ( potentially forming orthomagmatic sulfide deposits within mafic cumulate rocks ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The onset of magnetite fractionation in relatively evolved magmas ( ≥60 wt . %
In addition to elevated water contents and oxidation states ( in many cases , as noted above ) , primary arc magmas are also enriched in a suite of volatile and fluid - mobile elements , including Cl ( 500 - 2000 ppm Cl ; Wallace , 2005 ) , S ( 900 - 2500 ppm S ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) , large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE : Rb , K , Cs , Sr , Ba , and U ) , and Li , B , Pb , As , and Sb ( Perfit et al . , 1980 ; Gill , 1981 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2012 ) .
The source of sulfur in arc magmas
In contrast , shallowly emplaced magmas ( 0 . 5 - 1 kb ) initially exsolve low salinity vapors that are inefficient in dissolving chloride - soluble metals .
Although these metals siderophile in character , Au and the PGE are considered to be highly siderophile , and partition strongly into most sulfide phases relative to silicate melts ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ) , while the PGE also partition differentially into metal alloy phases ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
In the case of gold , however , highly oxidized magmas ( FMQ > > + 1 ) may have limited potential for Au transport and ore formation .
This means that oxidized magmas dominated by sulfate ( FMQ ≥ + 1 ) will be less likely to become saturated in sulfide phases .
Moreover , these anomalously Cu - rich magmas ( if these compositions indeed reflect magmatic values ) do not clearly correlate with known porphyry Cu deposits .
This suggests that magmatic Cu concentrations are moderated by the presence of minor amounts of sulfides in the source , into which chalcophile and siderophile metals ( such as Cu , Au , and the platinum group elements ; PGE ) will preferentially partition ( Keays , 1987 ( Keays , , 1995Lee et al . , 2012 ) , even for moderately to strongly oxidized rocks .
Assuming that these high - Cu values do reflect magmatic compositions , the reason for this incompatible behavior is not clear , but could be due either to low total sulfur fugacity ( unlikely in most arc settings ) or unusually high oxidation states , such that sulfide solubility was not exceeded or sulfides were destabilized by oxidation ( e . g . , Ballhaus et al . , 1991 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
Water solubility in silicate melts increases with pressure ( Burnham , 1979 ; Baker and Alletti , 2012 ) .
As discussed above , reduction will result in voluminous sulfide saturation and loss of potential to form later magmatic hydrothermal ore deposits ; this may explain the dearth of porphyry deposits in , for example , Japan , where the lower crust contains graphitic lithologies ( Sato , 2012 ; Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) .
These data suggest that Cu is mildly compatible during partial melting and fractionation processes , likely reflecting minor degrees of sulfide saturation throughout the magmatic cycle .
To date , no examples of large sulfide accumulations in lower crustal arc magmatic systems have been reported , with the possible exception of Alaskan - type PGE deposits ( Slansky et al . , 1991 ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Batanova et al . , 2005 ; Thakurta et al . , 2008Thakurta et al . , , 2014 .
Variability in the extent of oxidative alteration and the amount of oxidized ( or reduced ) sediment may , therefore , be the primary cause of the wide range of oxidation states found in arc magmas , from essentially unoxidized ( MORB - like ) to highly oxidized compositions ( Fig . 3 ) .
In the former case , numerous post - subduction scenarios , such as collision or post - collisional rifting , can be envisaged that would re - melt sulfide - bearing lower crustal
It also does not correlate with Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios in the rocks , and both relatively oxidized rocks can have high Cu contents , although this is not common in either case .
The arc samples are divided into continental plus mature island arc ( hereafter referred to as - mature arc‖ ) and island arc suites .
The resulting primary magmas are hydrous , tholeiitic , high - Mg basalts ( Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) , which evolve to calc - alkaline compositions by early fractionation of olivine , clinopyroxene , and magnetite , and later crystallization of hornblende and plagioclase ( Grove and Kinzler , 1986 ; Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ) .
In somewhat more evolved rocks ( 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ) , the data scatter to higher Cu contents in both arc settings , but the bulk of the data remains below ~ 150 ppm Cu .
This method has the advantage that amphibole is commonly present in arc plutonic and volcanic rocks , but its dependence on multiple element electron microprobe analyses , and the commonly complex history of amphiboles in igneous rocks leads to a relatively high degree of uncertainty in the interpretation of the results .
Thus , processes that could deplete magmas in ore metals could significantly reduce their fertility , and vice versa .
Circumstances that give rise to more Au - rich porphyry deposits either reflect late - stage magmatic and hydrothermal processes ( e . g . , Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ) or atypical arc , back - arc , or post - subduction processes associated with more alkaline magmas ( e . g . , Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Jensen and Barton , 2000 ) .
These hydrous compositions predispose arc magmas to developing - adakite - like‖ trace element signatures of Sr enrichment and heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) depletion , through early and abundant crystallization of pyroxene and hornblende ( which preferentially partition middle ( MREE ) and HREE ) , and late crystallization of plagioclase ( which would otherwise deplete the melt in Sr ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ;
The data in Figure 3 suggest that most arc magmas are moderately oxidized , but can become strongly oxidized ( and in some cases reduced ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) , during differentiation .
These trends appear to be independent of oxidation state , and there is no clear correlation between rocks higher Cu concentrations and porphyry ore deposits .
An additional factor may be the presence of platinoid metal alloys in the mantle source , which can dramatically fractionate the PGE ( Park et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
Relatively few suites of geochemical data for arc rocks include direct estimations of oxidation state , but where separate chemical analyses of FeO have been made , the Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ratio can be used as a proxy .
The process most widely recognized as having an oxidative effect on magmas as they rise towards the surface is devolatilization , especially of reduced or weakly oxidized gaseous species such as H 2 , H 2 S , and S IV O 2 ( Mathez , 1984 ; Candela , 1986 ; Gaillard et al . , 2001 ; Holloway , 2004 ; Burgisser and Scaillet , 2007 ; Zimmer et al . , 2010 ) .
On the other hand , Laubier et al . ( 2014 ) used V / Yb ratios to argue for increasing magmatic oxidation state from MORB ( FMQ ≈ 0 ) , through back - arc basins , to arcs ( ~ FMQ ≥ + 2 ) .
The additional essential presence of water in these magmatic - tohydrothermal systems is taken as read ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2011b ) .
Regardless of the exact process , it is clear that both fluids and melts are capable of transferring the oxidized signature of seafloor alteration and sediments into the mantle wedge source of arc magmas , and that the effect does not need to be extreme to raise the fO 2 of these magmas 1 or 2 log units above normal MORB - depleted mantle values to the range typical or arc magmas ( Evans , 2012 ) .
Under mantle conditions , it would seem likely that some sulfide liquid is present , and that it will have a major control on the abundances and ratios of chalcophile and siderophile elements in arc magmas , particularly if these sulfides are preferentially left in the restite rather than being entrained in the magma , due to their density and wetting properties ( as suggested by Mungall and Su , 2005 ) .
The same principles that were used to consider the loss of metals to restite in the mantle wedge apply to fractionating minerals and melts .
rocks under sulfur - undersaturated conditions , leading to redissolution of sulfides and their metals , and the potential formation of post - subduction porphyry Cu ± Au deposits .
The requirement for a considerable amount of time before the mantle wedge becomes - primed‖ to generate potentially fertile ( moderately oxidized , S - rich , hydrous ) melts may explain the rarity
The distribution of data shown in Figures 4 and 5 suggests that Cu contents in mafic to intermediate magmas from both arc and ridge tectonic settings are similar and generally quite low ( < 200 ppm , similar to values obtained by Lee et al . , 2012 , in mantle melting models ) .
These processes have been collectively termed MASH , standing for crustal melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization of arc magmas ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ) .
However , petrogenetic and geochemical considerations suggest that slab melting only occurs in exceptional circumstances in Phanerozoic arcs , such as the subduction young , hot oceanic lithosphere , or at slab windows or tears where hot asthenosphere directly contacts subducted oceanic crust ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock et , 1994 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
As discussed by Richards ( 2009 ) , the presence of moderate amounts of residual sulfide relative to a large volume of silicate melt ( e . g . , ~ 0 . 001 - 1 wt . % sulfide ; intermediate Rfactor of 10 2 - 10 5 ; Fig . 6 ) will deplete the magma low - abundance , high partition coefficient elements such as Au and PGE ( highly siderophile elements ) but may have little effect on the concentration of more abundant elements with lower partition coefficient such as Cu , leading to high Cu / Au , Cu / PGE magmas ( e . g . , Park et al . , 2013 ; Fig . 6 ) .
However , it is notable that this proportion is similar to the volume of arc magma crystallized in plutons versus being erupted at surface ( ~ 80 % vs . ~ 20 % , respectively ; Carmichael , 2002 ; Sadofsky et al . , 2008 ; Barker et al . , 2013 ) .
Using the same dataset as for Figures 2 and 3 There is a broader scatter to higher Cu contents in tholeiitic and island arc rocks in the range 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ( which corresponds to the peak in Cu concentration ) compared with mature arcs ( Fig . 5 ; mature arc : mean = 59 . 9 ± 42 . 6 , median = 46 . 9 ppm , n = 1247 ; island arc : mean = 94 . 0 ± 58 . 9 ppm , median = 85 . 0 ppm , n = 372 ; tholeiite : mean = 117 . 5 ± 64 . 2 ppm , median = 110 . 0 ppm , n = 115 ) .
Thus , segregation of this material does not seem to significantly deplete the remaining magma in Cu ( or Mo ) , although Au and PGE may be lost .
Jenner et al . ( 2010 ) attribute this trend to initial incompatible behavior of Cu , followed by change to sulfide saturation triggered by the onset of magnetite crystallization ( the - magnetite crisis‖ ) , or volatile exsolution ( Sun et al . , 2004 ) .
The distribution of the bulk of the data suggests that , under most conditions , the mantle sources of arc and ridge magmas are sulfide - saturated ( Keays , 1995 ) , and that most of these magmas remain saturated or close to saturation throughout their differentiation history .
to achieve a steady state condition of 1 or 2 log fO 2 units above background depleted mantle values ( e . g . , up to FMQ ≈ + 1 ) .
These two parameters together exercise fundamental controls on the behavior of metals during partial melting in the mantle , differentiation in the crust , and during volatile exsolution and cooling .
Occam ' s razor suggest that , in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary , the simpler one - step magma - to - fluid partitioning process can efficiently form large porphyry deposits , and the processes involved are well established in the literature .
This reaction , for the first time in the evolution of typical arc magmatic to hydrothermal systems , generates high activities dissolved sulfide , which cause the early precipitation of Cuand Mo - bearing sulfide minerals ( chalcopyrite , bornite , and molybdenite , along with pyrite ) .
The majority of experimental and analytical observations suggest that seafloor alteration and sedimentation since the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event introduces a flux of oxidized components into the mantle wedge upon subduction and slab devolatilization .
Lee et al . ( 2012 ) and Chiaradia ( 2014 ) further suggest that such processes could lead to a significant accumulation of metals within the lower crust , such that 70 - 80 % of the Cu in the magma flux might be sequestered in arc cumulate rocks ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 occur in some cases , the broad arrays of data shown in Figure 4 are more consistent with mildly compatible behavior of Cu throughout the differentiation range for the bulk magmas , with incompatible behavior ( as indicated by higher Cu contents ) being the exception .
Likely these two processes overlap , but it is clear that the bulk of dissolved magmatic water exsolves during second boiling at relatively shallow levels in the crust , whereas CO 2 , which has much lower solubility in silicate melts , begins to degas much earlier and at depth ( i . e . , during first boiling ; Holloway , 1976 ; King and Holloway , 2002 ) .
As temperatures continue to cool and equation 8progresses further to the right , the fluids become increasingly acidic from the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 ( and HCl ; Hedenquist and Taran , 2013 ) , leading to the characteristic formation of sericite ( phyllic alteration ) and then clays ( argillic alteration ) in originally feldspar - stable wallrocks ( potassic alteration ; Hemley and Jones , 1964 ; Montoya and Hemley , 1975 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Reed et al . , 2013 ) .
The Sanjiang region in SE Tibet Plateau , and the western Yunnan region in southwestern China constitute a collage Gondwana - derived micro - continental blocks and arc terranes that were accreted together after the closure of the Paleotethys Oceans in Permo - Triassic .
The chondrite - normalized rare earth element ( REE ) pattern shows a slightly negative Eu anomaly .
The pattern of primitive mantle - normalized trace elements exhibits pronounced negative anomalies P , typically indicative of subduction - related magmatism ( Roger et al . , 2000 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ( Roger et al . , 2000 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ) .
Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene potassic - ultrapotassic igneous rocks along the Jinshajiang - Ailaoshan tectonic belt
Early volcanism during the Pliocene or Miocene occurred in southeast and northern margins Tengchong volcanic area ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ) , it migrated to the central part of the field during the Pleistocene to Holocene ( Huangpu and Jiang , 2000 ) .
Paleocene to Early Eocene magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits
Mineralization occurred within the alkaline porphyry as pyrite and chalcopyrite stockwork veins and in the Mesozoic sedimentary rocks as vein bodies ( Liang et al . , 2007 ; Bi et al . , 2004 ) .
Microthermometric measurements on these fluid inclusions show that the ore fluid was characterized by medium to low temperature the leucogranite was generally derived from a shallower level in the crust compared to the regional amphibolite .
Tectonics events in the northernmost Sanjiang were synchronized with those in the northern Tibet .
The Sanjiang ( Three Rivers ) region is named due to it is drained by three major rivers : the Jinshajiang , Lancangjiang and Nujiang .
The mafic rocks are almost porphyritic phenocryst olivine , clinopyroxene , and phlogopite .
The potassic intrusive felsic rocks in the central and southern segments share similar ages , and they intruded in a limited time around 35 Ma ( Lu et al . , 2012 ) , which is younger than those in the northern segment .
The mantle wedge metasomatism under the Simao and ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 38 Qiangtang blocks was induced by the subduction of the Ailaoshan and Jinshajiang Paleotethyan oceanic slab ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2009 ; Fan et al . , 2010 ) .
The Pliocene - Holocene volcanic rocks in the Tengchong extend about 90 km from north to south and 50 km from west to east ( Huangpu and Jiang , 2000 ) .
The metallogenic units , defined based on the magmatic and tectonic units , include the magmatic hydrothermal Sn - W ore deposits in Tengchong block , porphyry - skarn Mo and hydrothermal Pb - Zn in Cangyuan area , porphyry - skarn Au polymetallic ore deposits along Jinshajiang - Ailaoshan tectonic belt , magmatic hydrothermal Cu ( Co , Ag , etc . )
The ore - forming magmatic rocks were coeval with those exposed in the nearby Chongshan shear zone ( Fig . A drillcore ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
The concentrations of 4 He trapped in fluid inclusions of pyrites from the ores from the Yulong , Beiya , Machangqing ore deposits are ( 0 . 7 - ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 52 54 . 1 ) ×10 - 6 cm 3 STP g - 1 , and those of 40 Ar are ( 0 . 6 - 7 . 3 ) ×10 - 6 cm 3 STP g - 1 , 3 He / 4 He ratios are 0 . 3 - 2 . 5 Ra , 40 Ar / 36 Ar ratios are 316 - 1736 , and 3 He / 36 Ar ratios are 0 . 2 - 11 . 2×10 - 3 ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) .
The increased pressure and temperature induced by the subduction of South China lithosphere caused metamorphism in the deeper parts along the block margin and release of metamorphic fluid .
The potassic - ultrapotassic magmatism in the and Beiya - Machangqing areas , in the northern and central parts of the Jinshajiang - Ailaoshan belt respectively , where important porphyries were formed ( Figs . 4 and 9b ) .
The S - type granitoid associated with the Sn mineralization in the Tengchong block also reflects a reworking of thickened crust , which is possibly formed in response to the Mesotethyan ocean closure ( Deng et al . , 2013 ) .
The crustal structure is revised from Socquet and Pubellier ( 2005 ) .
The NS - trending subduction zone of Indian oceanic plate and the NE - trending Ninety East Ridge represented by the Kerguelen hotspot formed at 130 Ma ( Muller et al . , 1993 ) occur to the west of the Sanjiang ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) .
The ore deposits controlled by the shear zones were investigated by Hou et al . ( 2007 ) and Sun et al . ( 2009 ) , those in the Mesozoic continental basins by Xue et al . ( 2007 ) , He et al . ( 2009 ) , and Tang et al . ( 2013c ) , and those associated with the potassic - ultrapotassic intrusive rocks by Hou et al . ( 2003 ) , Liang et al . ( 2006 ) , Xu et al . ( 2007 ) and Lu et al . ( 2013a ) .
The Gonglang , Manghao granodiorites in the Cangyuan area show zircon SHRIMP U - Pb ages of 40 . 9 to 40 Ma ( Yu et al . , 2008 ) , and the Laochang ( Cangyuan domain ) and Menglinshan granodiorites display zircon LA - ICP - MS U - Pb ages of 43 . 41 to 45 Ma ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) .
The intraplate - type magmas in the Gaoligongshan - Tengchong region were interpreted to be the magmatic expression of the asthenosphere upwelling following the breakoff of subducted Neotethyan slab from the India continental plate during the Eocene ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .
The mafic rocks in the western Yangtze Craton had emplacement age at ~ 35 Ma , as dated by the whole - rock , phlogopite , and sanidine 40 Ar / 39 Ar method ( e . g . , Guo et al . , 2005 ; Huang et al . , 2010 ) .
The olivine trachybasalts have ( Th / Ba ) N mostly smaller than 1 and ( Th / La ) N ratios from 1 to 2 , possibly indicating that the source was modified by slab - derived fluids ; the rest lithologies have higher ( Th / Ba ) N and ( Th / La ) N reaching to 5 , suggesting a meltrelated enrichement .
The Lailishan granite is characterized by high K , F , and S contents , and elevated initial 87 Sr / 87 Sr ratio ( 0 . 7124 - 0 . 7138 ) , suggesting a crustal anatexis ( Lu and Wang , 1993 ) .
The molybdenite Re - Os and calcite Sm - Nd isotopic dating shows this type of deposit was formed in 58 - 48 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2009b ; Zhang et al . , 2013b ) .
The mineral assemblages and the element enrichment in the ores , the presence of CO 2 - enriched fluid inclusions , and large contribution of lower crust to ore metals are compatible with the characteristics of orogenic gold deposit formed in accretionary orogenesis .
The slab breakoff in the southern Tibet , expressed by the regional thermally driven metamorphism ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) and rapid cooling of the Gangdese granitic batholiths in the Tibet
This non - coaxial compression induced kinking of the Sanjiang belt in the middle , and clockwise rotation in the south .
The re - oriented Sanjiang , as well as SE Aisa , still persisted a slow clockwise rotation , resulting in the formation of several NE - trending strike - slip faults in the Indochina and Sibumasu blocks .
The Cangyuan granitoids with Mo ore deposits were produced nearby the collision zone of the Simao and Baoshan blocks with a thickened crust .
The orogenic belts formed during block amalgamation bounding the Mesozoic basins provided voluminous metal accumulations for the basins , which is considered to be the preliminary source for the MVT Pb - Zn polymetallic ore deposits .

In the Wandongshan open - pit , the barren quartz - K - feldspar porphyry shows the formation of skarn along its contact and was intruded by ( Lu et al . , 2013b ) .
As the lithosphere was underthrusting after the removal of the lithospheric mantle ( Figs . 10b and 10c ) , the crust of the South China block was split , with a partial thrust westward , followed by shearing and exhumation , resulting in the formation of Ailaoshan - Red River shear zone ( Fig . 10d ) .
During the lithospheric mantle removal , the simultaneous melting of the metasomatized lithospheric mantle and juvenile lower crust with possible metal enrichment contributed to the formation of potassic - ultrapotassic intrusive rocks and related porphyry - skarn mineralization .
In the Xialaxiu basin , coeval granitic intrusion and volcanic rocks with similar geochemical compositions emplaced in 51 - 49 Ma based on the zircon U - Pb and biotite 40 Ar / 39 Ar dating ( Roger et al . , 2000 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ) .
In the western Sanjiang , the exhumation of Gaoligongshan shear zone and Tengchong volcanism occurred coevally within an extensional setting .
Numerous ore deposits of diverse genetic types and metal speciations , including porphyry Cu - , Au - , and Mo - , Mississippi valley type ( MVT ) Pb - Zn , and orogenic Au , were formed in Cenozoic , making the Sanjiang one of the most productive and potential for metal resources in China .
Numerous ore deposits orogenic Au , were formed in Cenozoic , making the Sanjiang one of the most productive and potential for metal resources in China .
12 ) The Beiya ore deposit , the largest porphyry - skarn Au deposit in China , has a gold reserve of > 200 tons according to the exploration carried out in 2012 ( Fig . 5 ; Yang and Lü , 2011 ; He et al . , 2013b ) .
The coeval MVT Pb - Zn deposits , which were interpreted to originate from circulating basinal brines ( He et al . , 2009 ) , occurred in the Mesozoic basins .
Since these orogenic belts posseses metallic mineralization , i . e . , the Yangla Cu polymetallic ore deposits in the Jinshajiang suture , the sediments could be been enriched in metals due to the exhumation and erosion of mineralized rocks .
Plots of the Th / Zr against Nb / Zr and the Nb / Y against Rb / Y also denote that they were affected by both melt - related enrichments ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) .
In the plots of εNd ( t ) vs . Nb / La and εNd ( t ) vs . SiO 2 , the Tengchong and Gaoligongshan samples define a coherent correlation ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .
A summary of the Oligocene process of the Sanjiang is as follows .
In the period from Paleocene to Early Eocene , magmatic - hydrothermal Sn ore deposits were developed in the Tengchong block and Cupolymetallic vein - type ore deposits within the Mesozoic basins ( Fig . 5 ) .
This deposit is the largest Zn - Pb deposit in China with reserves of 12 . 84 Mt Zn and 2 . 64 Mt Pb ( Liu et al . , 1993 ) The most remarkable difference between the Jinding giant ore deposit and other smaller ore deposits is that metals in the former is partly contributed by the lower crust , which was reflected by the Pb isotopic compositions ( Fig . 7a .
It is shown that the Neotethyan slab breakoff in the northern Sanjaing lagged for ~ 5 Ma than that in the southern Sanjiang .
It is proposed that the kinking in the Sanjiang region was controlled by the non - coaxial compressions India continent , which are much larger in size than the blocks in Sanjiang .
It was believed that the mantle source beneath was previously modified by slab melt and fluid during the subduction of Neotethyan plate ( Wang et al . , 2006a ; Zhou et al . , 2012 ) , since the Tengchong lava is near the arc ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 43 belt related to the Neotethyan slab subduction ( Fig . 4 ) .
Thus , the analysis of the Cenozoic tectonic evolution in Sanjiang is important in understanding the interaction of multiple crustal blocks and the nature and mechanism of the associated metallogeny .
19 ) in the western part of Lanping basin and the Bailongchang ( No .
In the central segment , most potassicultrapotassic magmatic rocks are distributed west of the shear zone .
These investigations employed modern geophysical techniques and precise geochronological methods , offering important information on the geological processes in Sanjiang .
We prefer to relate these The Na - rich mafic rocks emplaced at ca .
We thus prefer the mechanism of removal of lower lithospheric mantle as the trigger ( Fig . 6e ) .
We therefore interpret that the potassic - ultrapotassic magmatic rocks and associated ore deposits in the southern segment and the coeval ones in the central segment were displaced into two groups from one cluster by the Ailaoshan - Red River shear zone ( Figs . 11b and 11c ) .
However , the linkage between the tectonic , magmatic , and metallogenic aspects and the control of pre - Cenozoic lithosphere architecture on the Cenozoic evolution have not been well addressed .
The sediments could be imprinted by complex Pb Phases i and iv were largely controlled by the oceanic plate subductions , and the middle two occurred in intracontinental environment characterized by the most conspicuous metallogenic events under a process of lithosphere removal and underthrust ( Figs . 10b , 10c , and 11 ) .
The water in the hot springs is mainly meteoric water , which has reacted with the rocks in shallow crust , as inferred from the small offset of the δD and δ 18 O values of the spring waters from those of the local meteoric water ( Liao and Zhao , 1999 ; Xiao et al . , 2010 ) .
Data sources for different genetic types of deposits : Magmatic hydrothermal deposit in the Lanping basin ( Wu et al . , 2003 ; Xu and Zhou , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Song , 2009 ) ; Jinding MVT Pb - Zn deposit ( Bai et al . , 1985 ; Ye et al . , 1992 ; Zhou and Zhou , 1992 1993 ; Xiu et al . , 2006 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2011a ) and other MVT deposits in the Lanping basin ( Zhang , 1993 ; Wei , 2001 ; Wang and He , 2003 ; Xu and Zhou , 2004 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Song , 2009 ) ; Zhenyuan ( Hu et al . , 1995 ; Dong et al . , 1997 ) and Daping ( Han et al . , 1997 ; Chang and Zhu , 2005 ; Yuan et al . , 2010 ) orogenic Au deposits within the Ailaoshan - Red River shear zone .
This is contradictory to the theory that the shallow subductions are universal in ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 69 the NE - directed subduction slab for modern plate tectonics ( Doglioni et al . , 1999 ) .
After the amalgamation , it was influenced by the subduction of the Meso - and Neotethyan oceanic plates from Jurassic to Paleocene .
These facilitate the circulation of meteoric water in extensional basins induced the gold enrichment in the western Sanjiang .
In this paper , we identify the following four main phases for the Cenozoic evolution in the Sanjiang region .

In this paper , we synthesize the information from various aspects to build a coherent picture for the Cenozoic tectonomagmatic and metallogenic evolution of the Sanjiang region .
Gold and arsenic incorporation into pyrite is strongly coupled in pyrite from many 3 different types of ore deposits , including Carlin - type Au deposits ( Frimmel et al . , 2005 ; Agangi et al . , 2013 ) .
Gold and arsenic incorporation into pyrite is strongly coupled in pyrite from many 3 different types of ore deposits , including Carlin - type Au ( e . g . , Cline , 2001 ; Emsbo et al . , 2003 ; Reich et al . , 2005 ; Muntean et al . , 2011 ) , porphyry Cu , Cu - Au , and epithermal Au ( e . g . , Cook and Chryssouliss , 1990 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) , orogenic Au ( e . g . , Morey et al . , 2008 ; Large et al . , 2007 ) , volcanogenic massive sulphide ( VHMS ) ( Huston et al . , 1995 ; McClenaghan et al . , 2004 ) , iron - oxide Cu - Au ( IOCG ) deposits ( Frimmel et al . , 2005 ; Agangi et al . , 2013 ) .
Higher Au concentrations are mostly due to the presence of Au nanoparticles ( Vaughan and Kyin , 2004 ) , such as the analyses of Sung et al . ( 2009 ) and Cook et al . ( 2009 ) showing Au concentrations of ~ 3000 ppm and 11 , 500 ppm , respectively , both of which are due to inclusions of Au - bearing minerals ( Ciobanu et al . , 2012 ) .
Additional differences in the Au - As distributions of data may be due to Au and / or As remobilization from the pyrite structure during mineral / fluid interaction , which resulted in the formation of nanoscale porosity as an effect of dissolution - reprecipitation reactions ( Putnis , 2009 , and references therein ) .
Nanoscale porosity in pyrite from epithermal ore deposits is tightly related with the formation of trace - element rich growth zoning .
Concentrations of Au and As in epithermal deposits are higher than porphyry systems , as expected ( Fig . 7b and c ) , and some Au and As analyses fall above the Au solubility limit defined by Reich et al . ( 2005 ) .
Most of the trace elements in pyrite in epithermal Au deposits are located in growth zones , often in alternating zones that are indicative of surface ( kinetic ) or crystal - chemically ( equilibrium ) growth during metal deposition , respectively ( Chouinard et al . , 2005a ; Deditius et al . , 2009a ) .
Gold - arsenic clusters of points of porphyry deposits overlap significantly ( at Au 0 . 19 - 16 . 6 ppm and As 20 - 3765 ppm ( Fig . 7c ) ) .
The higher concentrations of Au in pyrite noted for some of the high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits may also reflect their relatively oxidizing conditions of formation when compared with low - sulfidation systems , which could favour formation of Au3 + and As2 As2 + species might be present in the pyrite structure ( Chouinard et al . , 2005a and b ; Simmons et al . , 2005 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ) .
The position of Au - As data points relative to the solubility limit in Figure 7c indicates that saturation of Au in pyrite from porphyry and epithermal deposits is similar to the limit for Au in As - pyrite from the Carlin - type deposits CAu = 0 . 02 · CAs + 4 × 10 - 5 ( Reich et al . , 2005 ) .
The low amount of Au in pyrite in this locality is probably due to the high - temperature of mineralization , ~ 450 oC , and deposition of Au in the native form .
Pyrite compositions from epithermal veins at the Rosia - Poieni porphyry Cu - Au deposit revealed high Au : As ratios ranging from 1 : 1 to 1 : 10 ( grey triangles , Fig . 10 ) .
The solid solubility limit of Au in arsenian pyrite defined by an Au / As ratio of 0 . 02 ( Reich et al . , 2005 ) is independent of the geochemical environment of pyrite formation and depends on the crystal - chemical properties of pyrite and post - deposition alteration ( Fig . 1 ) .
In Carlin - type deposits , Au 25 chemisorbed to As - rich mineral surfaces led to the formation of metastable ( Au , As ) - rich pyrite , and Au was subsequently exsolved as Au NPs and / or associated As - minerals .
In arsenian pyrite from Sunrise Dam , intense dissolution - reprecipitation processes are responsible for Au mobilization and formation of particulate Au and arsenopyrite ( Sung et al . , 2009 ) .
If Au is delivered as As ( HS ) 0 complexes , then it is likely that it will be incorporated into the As - pyrite as Au + ( Cardile et al . , 1993 ) .
The presence or absence of arsenopyrite associated with pyrite seems to have no impact on the concentrations of Au in the latter one , and statistically arsenopyrite contains higher amount of Au in all types of ore deposits ( Cook and Chryssoulis , 1990 ; Arehart et al . , 1993 ; Vaughan and Kyin , 2004 ; Reich et al . , 2005 ; Wagner et al . , 2007 ; Large et al . , 2007 ; Sung et al . , 2009 ; Cook et al . , 2013 ) .
5 . 1 Carlin - type deposits Pyrite analyses from Carlin - type deposits form a wedge - shaped zone with most analyses plotting below an Au : As ratio of 1 : 100 ( Fig . 5a ) .
5 . 3 Porphyry and epithermal deposits Unlike Carlin - type and orogenic Au deposits , trace element data in pyrite from porphyry Cu deposits are very limited ( Pass , 2010 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ; and this paper ) .
5 . 5 Retrograde solid solubility of Au and As in arsenian pyrite Gold - arsenic relations not only help constrain the chemical limits of these two elements in pyrites from various types of ore deposits , but also provide key information on the approximate temperature controls on Au incorporation into arsenian pyrite .
These As values are commonly reported for pyrite from Carlin - type , epithermal , orogenic and porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Emsbo et al . , 2003 ; Pals et al . , 2003 ; Reich et al . , 2005 ; Large et al . , 2007 ; Barker et al . , 2009 ; Deditius et al . , 2009a ; Sung et al . , 2009 ; Pass , 2010 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ; Velásquez et al . , 2014 ) .
Here , Au is in solid solution and also forms Au nanoparticles , and As - S correlations indicate that As occurs as As1 - .
Also , progressive cooling that lead to As ordering in pyrite might cause phase separation and exsolution of As - rich domains enriched with Au , previously reported as stacking faults ( Simon et al . , 1999a ) .
Existing Au - As data of pyrite from VHMS , IOCG , Witwatersrand Au , and coal deposits , although limited , allow some conclusions about the behaviour of As and Au in hydrothermal systems .
Indeed , LA - ICP - MS time - resolved depth profiles of pyrite revealed the presence of Au NPs in porous , trace element rich detrital pyrite , and vein - stage , recrystallized pyrite that formed during the peak of metamorphism ( Agangi et al . , 2013 ) .
However , concentrations of Au in vapour - rich and particularly in brine - rich inclusions are equal to or higher , 0 . 4 - 11 . 4 ppm and 2 . 4 - 41 ppm , respectively .
By analogy the As - rich nanozones in pyrite may be responsible for the relatively uniform size of Au NPs in Carlin - type and epithermal deposits ; i . e . , < 50 nm ( Reich et al . , 2006 ; Deditius et 34 al . , 2011 ) .
The lack of a wedge - shape zone for Au and As analyses might be related to differences in the composition of the mineralizing fluid or conditions of pyrite formation .
In contrast , fluid inclusions in quartz from the 20 Chinese Shuiyindong and Yata Carlin - style are larger , ( ~ 20 μm ) , and of aqueous - carbonic composition ( Su et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the fine - grained , porous and irregular nature of arsenian pyrite textures in Carlin - type deposits ( Palenik et al . , 2004 ) suggests that efficient scavenging of Au from solution is dominated by the kinetics of pyrite precipitation rather than high - T equilibrium partitioning , as discussed below .
Accordingly , the lower contents of Au in arsenian pyrite from orogenic Au deposits are a due to consequence of the higher temperature of their formation than pyrite from Carlin - type and epithermal deposits , complex fluid - induced , recrystallization histories of pyrite and subsequent Au mobilization ( e . g . , Large et al . , 2007 ; Morey et al . , 2008 ) .
In addition , the differences in the Au - As composition between the pyrite from Carlin - type and orogenic Au deposits may be related to the re - equilibration of pyrite compositions during protracted cooling and / or heating processes in the latter ones .
Compilation of Au - As concentrations and formation temperatures for pyrite indicates that Au solubility in pyrite is retrograde ; Au and As contents decrease as a function of increasing temperature from ~ 200 oC to ~ 500 oC .
Consequently , porosity in pyrite may act as an intra - mineral conduit for the hydrothermal mineralizing fluid that enhances metal remobilization from the pyrite structure or from the ( Au , As ) - bearing NPs .
The textures of fine - grained arsenian pyrite deposited on pre - ore coarser pyrite in the Chinese Carlin - style deposits and classic Carlin - type deposits from Nevada are very similar .
The analyses for pyrite with Au nanoparticles from Bathrust ( yellow circles in Figure 6b , and black dashed circles in Figure 8 ) plot below the solubility limit of Au and within the same range of Au concentrations as the analyses of As - pyrite with Au nanoparticles reported at Sunrise Dam by Sung et al . ( 2009 ) .
It is important to ore deposits and environmental geochemistry because it hosts economically valuable amounts of Au associated with other metals and metalloids that can be enriched up to the weight percent ( wt . % ) level , including As , Hg , and Tl ( e . g . , Arehart et al . , 1993 ; Cook and Chryssoulis , 1990 ; Chowdhurry et al . , 1999 ; Hofstra and Cline , 2000 ; Smedley and Kinniburgh , 2002 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2005 ; Reich et al . , 2005 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Simmons et al . , 2005 ; Rickard and Luther , 2007 ; Large et al . , 2009 ; Deditius et al . , 2011 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
However , it forms metal nanoparticles together with other metals and sulfides when the dominant metal can no longer be hosted as solid solution in the pyrite structure .
On the other hand , precipitation of As - pyrite under the lower temperature conditions , ~ 200 oC , in Carlin - type and epithermal deposit is a surface and kinetically controlled process that resulted in formation of polycrystalline , often nanoscale , aggregates of As - rich Fe - deficient pyrite ( Fleet and Mumin , 1997 ; Palenik et al . , 2004 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ) .
( c ) Comparison of wedgeshaped zones for pyrite from Carlin - type and orogenic deposits .
In addition , during higher temperature stages of mineralization the Au - bearing nanoparticles may dissolve back into the structure of pyrite as suggested by Cook et al . ( 2009 ) who performed heating experiments on natural pyrite from Dongping at temperatures of 330 oC and 420 oC .
5 . 6 Partitioning of Au and As into pyrite One key question is whether pyrite records the As : Au ratio of the ore fluid from which it precipitated .
It was documented that amorphous NPs of As - Fe - S ( i . e . , melt ) were formed at about ~ 320 oC , in pyrite from the high - sulfidation Pueblo Viejo deposit ( Deditius et al . , 2009b ) .
One trend 2 is formed by pyrites from Carlin - type and orogenic Au deposits where compositions are largely controlled by fluid - rock - interactions and / or can be highly perturbed by changes in temperature and alteration by hydrothermal fluids .
Examples can be found in porphyry , high - sulfidation epithermal , and Carlin - type deposits where at least part of As and Au were deposited contemporaneously in pyrite ( Barker et al . , 2009 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ; Deditius et al . 2009a ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) , and in some cases formed As - Au - bearing metallic NPs ( Deditius et al . , 2011 ) .
However , the analyses of pyrite from porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposits do not form a wedge shape - zone similar to that reported for Carlin - type pyrite ( Fig . 6a ) .
In addition , analyses of As and Au in synthetic fluid inclusions trapped at high - temperature ( 800 oC ) under S - free vs . S - bearing conditions ( Simon et al . , 2007 ) also plot within the range of the highest concentrations of As and Au noted in pyrite from porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 10 ) .
On the other hand , in the As - free pyrite from Dongping , China , porosity was a pathway for migration of highly volatile , Te - enriched hydrothermal fluid that deposited nanoparticulate Au - tellurides .
In contrast , reduction of Au + to Au0 will be favoured when this metal is delivered as Au - Cl complexes to the surface of other sulfides ( e . g . , Hyland and Bancroft , 1989 ; Eggleston and Hochella , 1991 ) .
In addition , we explore the mineralogical and geochemical factors controlling Au and As speciation in pyrite , while discussing the extent to which its Au - As composition preserves the Au / As signature of parent fluids .
Note that most analyses plot below the solubility limit after Reich et al . ( 2005 ) .
It is important to note that the type of Au - complex in the fluid will promote or decrease the probability of formation of nanoparticulate Au .
This explains the presence of nanoparticulate Au at lower Au / As ratios than in systems where metamorphic perturbations are absent Our results indicate that the coupled geochemistry of Au and As in pyrite in ore deposits is defined by two major trends that obey the solubility limit ( Reich et al . , 2005 ) : ( i ) pyrite from Carlin - type and orogenic deposits , displaying wedged - shaped zones where pyrite geochemistry is largely controlled by fluid - rock interactions ( e . g . , sulfidation of wall - rock ) ; and ( ii ) pyrite from porphyry - to - epithermal deposits whose composition registers and preserves the Au / As signature of ore fluids .
5 . 4 Additional insights into pyrite geochemistry from other types of ore deposits Additional insights into the behavior of Au and As in pyrite as a function of temperature can be gained from published data from VHMS deposits ( Fig . 8 ) .
At temperatures below 150 oC , the behaviour of As in ore fluids is controlled by formation of As2S3 phases , while at T > 200 oC the formation of sulfosalts and sulfides like arsenopyrite and arsenian pyrite exert a significant control on As ( Pokrovsky et al . , 2002a ) .
Figure 6b displays the impact of Au remobilization on Au - As concentrations in pyrite from 24 the Golden Ridge deposit , described by Morey et al . ( 2008 ) , upon alteration and / or deposition Au by a hydrothermal fluid .
So far there is no evidence that As coordinates Au atoms in the pyrite structure .
Kouzmanov et al . ( 2010 ) compared Au and As contents in pyrite and associated fluid inclusions .
Most of the discussion will refer to Carlin - type Au , orogenic Au deposits .
Therefore , massive precipitation of arsenian pyrite may result in about one order of magnitude depletion in Au content in the ore fluid ( Fig . 5b ) .
Simon et al . ( 1999a ) reported that Au forms 2 - or 4 - coordinated units with S atoms , not with As1 - .
Moreover , it has been shown recently that pyrite can host trace elements not only as solid solution or " structurally bound " species , but also as nanoparticles of metals with varying degrees of compositional complexity from native Au to Fe - As - Sb - Pb - Ni - Au - S nanophases ( Palenik et al . , 2004 ; Deditius et al . , 2011a ; Hough et al . , 2012 ) .
Note that the wedge - shaped zone ( 2 ) of the orogenic deposits is almost completely overlapped by the one representing pyrite from Carlin - type deposits .
This suggests that massive precipitation of Au - bearing arsenian pyrite in porphyry environments plays an unforseen role in modifying the Au - As concentrations of hydrothermal ore fluids .
Figure 7c clearly demonstrates an increase in the concentrations of Au and As in pyrite during the transition from porphyry to epithermal environments .
Reaction 2 shows the formation of one mole of Fe - depleted arsenian pyrite hosting Au in solid solution from main cationic components , and H2S ( Fig . 5a ) : 0 . 9Fe2 + + 0 . 006Ni2 + + 0 . 004Hg ( HS ) 2 + 0 . 001Au ( HS ) 0 + 1 . 791H2S + 0 . 19As ( OH ) 3 + 0 . 002Sb ( OH ) 3 ( Fe0 . 9Ni0 . 006Hg0 . 004Au0 . 001 ) 0 . 911 ( S1 . 8As0 . 19Sb0 . 002 ) 1 . 992 + 0 . 576H2O + 0 . 6H2 + 1 . 812H + .
Instead , they form a positive trend along an Au : As ratio of 1 : 100 ( Fig . 7c ) .
However , a substantial fraction ( ~ 30 % ) of Au - As analyses from epithermal deposits plot above the solubility limit for Au ( Fig . 7b ) , confirming the dominant state of Au supersaturation for mineralizing fluids in these systems .
This reaction does not incorporate the effect of Fe - vacancies , i . e . , the role of Fe - depleted , mineral surface .
This phenomenon may be particularly important for pyrite grains that contain micro - sulfosalts ( Tomkins et al . , 2007 ) , as reported for pyrite from epithermal deposits ( Deditius et al . , 2011a ) .
Consequently , 31 it is suggested that Witwatersrand pyrite exhibits a coupled Au - As geochemistry similar to that of Carlin - type and orogenic deposits .
Reich et al . ( 2005 ) showed that the maximum amount of Au that can be incorporated into pyrite is mainly a function of As concentration .
This Ostwald ripening - type process is best envisaged by the in - situ HRTEM experimental data by Reich et al . ( 2006 ) , who documented coarsening of larger Au nanoparticles ( > 10 nm ) in arsenian pyrite at the expense of the smaller ones ( < 4 30 nm ) , at temperatures of up to 650oC , with no visible changes in the As behaviour at the nanoscale .
The analytical data also show that the solid solubility limit of Au in arsenian pyrite defined by an Au / As ratio of 0 . 02 is independent of the geochemical environment of pyrite formation and rather depends on the crystal - chemical properties of pyrite and post - depositional alteration .
Here we explore these constraints using new and previously published EMPA , LA - ICP - MS , SIMS , and μ - PIXE analyses of As and Au in pyrite from Carlin - type Au , epithermal Au , porphyry Cu , Cu - Au , and orogenic Au deposits , volcanogenic massive sulfide ( VHMS ) , Witwatersrand Au , iron oxide copper gold ( IOCG ) , and coal deposits .
Based on the distribution of Au - As data points and the occurrence of nanoparticulate vs . solid solution Au , we propose that the solubility limit of Au in arsenian pyrite in orogenic deposits approximates the line : CAu = 0 . 004·CAs + 2·10 - 7 , which is two orders of magnitude lower than the solubility limit for Au in the Carlin - type deposits ( Fig . 6c ) .
For example , Tokhomirova et al . ( 1994 ) reported formation of AuxAsy intermetallic compounds ( x = 1 - 3 ; y = 2 - 6 ) on the surface of the Au electrode .
This change in the ratios supports the notion discussed above that changes in Au concentrations in pyrite are more sensitive to temperature than changes in As .
Deditius et al . ( 2009a ) and more recently Reich et al . ( 2013 ) have proposed that Au - As - Cu compositional features in pyrite may reflect periodic changes in hydrothermal fluid compositions that are recorded in complex zoning during epithermal Au mineralization .
In this study we evaluate the role of these factors using new and previously published SIMS , LA - ICP - MS , EMPA , and μ - PIXE analyses of pyrite from Carlin - type Au , epithermal Au , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au deposits .
In this study we evaluate the role of these factors using new and previously published SIMS , LA - ICP - MS , EMPA , and μ - PIXE analyses of pyrite from Carlin - type Au , epithermal Au , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au , orogenic Au , VHMS , IOCG , Witwatersrand Au , active hydrothermal vents in submarine environments , and coal deposits .
In the absence of experimentally - determined fluid / pyrite partition 36 coefficients for Au and As , we have tested this hypothesis by plotting compositions of pyrite from porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposits with published Au and As concentrations in coexisting fluids including fluid inclusions , subaerial and subaquatic fumaroles , and volcanic precipitates ( Fig . 10 ) .
Reich et al . ( 2005 ) reviewed XANES and EXAFS data showing that both Au + and Au0 were present in fine - grained , porous pyrite as shown in Figure 5a .
These constraints were supported by first principles calculations by Reich and Becker ( 2006 ) that revealed ordering of As in the pyrite structure with decreasing temperature from ~ 475 oC , a temperature characteristic for the Au deposition in porphyry , to ~ 275 oC , a temperature characteristic for epithermal deposits ( Table A . 1 ) .
Garnet fractionation depletes Fe from the magma , which drives sulfide segregation and removal magma ' s Cu into the lower crust , leaving only small amounts of Cu in the residual magma to make PCDs .
Porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) represent shallow level intrusions ( 2 - 5 km ) in the crust .
Point of sulfide exhaustion depends on solubility of S in the melt , which is enhanced at high fO 2 or high FeO content of melt .
Proposed mechanisms of generating Curich magmas include partial melting of subducted oceanic crust ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , metasomatized continental lithospheric mantle ( Richards , 2009 ; Rielli et al . , 2018 ) , arc lower crust or fluidmodified mantle wedge ( Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
Thick arcs
Sulfide solubility increases with FeO content , thus Fe - depleting magmatic series should deplete in Cu , consistent with the low Cu contents of continental arc magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Magmatic garnet is enriched in Fe but poor in ferric iron component ( Tang et al . , 2019b ) , so garnet fractionation can do what magnetite cannot : oxidize total Fe ( Fig . 7 ) .
Continental arc cumulates are represented by garnet pyroxenites ( arclogites ) , many with high ( > 50 % ) garnet mode and high Fe ( Fig . 6 ) .

Xenolith studies of continental arc crust confirm that the arc crust can grow to thickness of 60 - 90 km , resulting in direct impingement of the arc lithosphere If the upper plate is in extension , a thin arc crust is developed .
Upper plate compression , which deepens early intracrustal differentiation as well as upper crustal magmatic differentiation .
Residual magmas become more oxidized , increasing Cu scavenging power of the magma .
PCDs appear to occur only during the very last stages of the 30 - 80 Mya magmatic segment , in particular , when the arc crust maximum thickness ( as inferred by Tb / Yb ratios ) and just before magmatism terminates .
Crustal thickness and stress state likely play a role in controlling the depths at which magmas are emplaced .
Fe depletion facilitates sulﬁde segregation , which in turn se - questers most of the magma’s Cu into the lower crust .
If subarc mantle were more oxidizing , sulfide consumed during melting , resulting in much higher Cu contents in the magmas .
An increase Tb / Yb and Sr / Y suggests that the average pressures of magmatic differentiation must be increasing , which has been shown to also indicate increasing thickness of the arc crust ( Chapman et al . , 2015 ; Chiaradia , 2015 ; Farner and Lee , 2017 ) .
At shallow levels , degassing releases the oxidized magmatic fluids , which then migrate from the entire magma body and concentrate near the top , forming a Cu - enriched cupola .
Are cupolas fed from one large magma body or are they formed incrementally over the lifespans of many small plutons ( Schöpa et al . , 2017 ) ?
A ) Sulfur speciation in basaltic melt as a function of oxygen fugacity in log 10 units relative the fayalite magnetite quartz buffer ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
Once sulfide saturates , chalcophile elements depleted from the melt .
The BDTshallowing effects of erosion and magmatism combined with the BDT - deepening effects of hydrothermal circulation could result in a characteristic depth of late stage magmatic emplacement ( Cao et al . , 2019 ) .
This auto - oxidation of the magma , made possible by deep - seated garnet fractionation , increases the ability of endogenic magmatic fluids to self - scavenge Cu from large volumes of otherwise Cu - poor magmas and then transport and concentrate Cu to the tops magmatic bodies .
This divergence in the behavior of Fe is important to understanding Cu ' s behavior .
When magmas stall at shallow depths and cool , saturation in a free fluid phase composed of water or CO 2 , combined with oxidizing conditions , mobilizes Cu from the entire pluton .
These high Nb / Ta ratios in the arclogites are controlled by magmatic rutile , which is also favored at high pressures like garnet ( Tang et al . , 2019a ) .
Why the behavior of Fe might be controlled by crustal thickness is unclear .
Making a PCD clearly involves a sequence of events wherein Cu is first mobilized , then scavenged from the source rock and finally immobilized to concentrate the metals into an enriched https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . epsl . 2019 . 115868 0012 - 821X / © 2019 Elsevier B .

Removing Cu from a sulfide - bearing source requires melting degrees high enough to exhaust sulfide or conditions oxidizing enough to destabilize sulfide ( Ding and Dasgupta , 2017 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
However , magnetite has a 2 : 1 ratio of ferric to ferrous Fe , which should drive reduction of the magma ( Jenner et al . , 2010 ) , inconsistent with the fact that arc lavas , particularly in thick or continental arcs , are oxidized by the time they rise to the surface .
Effect of garnet fractionation on the residual magma ' s iron content ( as total FeO * ) and the proportion of iron in the system that is ferric ( molar Fe 3 + / Fe ) .
Generalized behavior of chalcophile elements during melting and crystallization .
Because the crust extension , heat flow is high and geotherms are advected upwards , resulting in a shallow brittle ductile transition ( BDT ) .
However , in compressional and thick arcs , magmas initially stall at depths ( as evidenced by high Tb / Yb and Sr / Y ratios ) too deep to generate significant fluid exsolution , and yet PCDs are formed when arcs maximum thickness .
Presumably , fluid release and migration occur during the last stages of magma crystallization .
By contrast , the upper plate in island arcs is in extension , preventing upper plate thickening and resulting in a stationary arc relative to the trench ( Karlstrom et al . , 2014 ) .
Consequently , later stage magmas are allowed to emplace shallowly and generate porphyries .
In contrast , in differentiation driven scenarios , parental magmas need not be enriched Cu , but widespread scavenging of mid - crustal to shallow level plutons followed by efficient trapping and concentration of the mobilized Cu into a localized reservoir ( ore ) is required ( Henley et al . , 2015 ; Kay and Mpodozis , 2001 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

However , because garnet is depleted in ferric iron , the remaining Fe in the magma becomes progressively oxidized , which eventually oxidizes sulfide to sulfate , thereby releasing sulfide bound Cu from the magma into solution .
PCDs form when the crust becomes thick ( > 45 km ) enough to crystallize garnet .
As large amounts of fluids are needed to scavenge Cu from such large volumes of plutons , high volatile contents are needed , but how much and from where such volatiles derive is an open question .
Enhanced stability of sulfide at high pressure may also play a role ( Cox et al . , 2019 ; Matjuschkin et al . , 2016 ) .
B ) Concentration of a chalcophile element in a primary mantle melt ( equilibrium batch melt ) as a function of degree of melting ( F ) of a peridotite with 200 ppm S and a chalcophile element partition coefficient between melt and sulfide of ∼ 1000 .
Here , we suggest that thick crust is critical because it forces deep - seated crystallization of garnet - bearing cumulates , which in turn drives oxidation , eventually making Cu available .
All were formed in the magmatic arcs associated with subduction zones , but there is a preference for regions of thick arc crust ( > 35 km ) , such as continental arcs and mature island arcs .
For example , although thickening will drive deeper differentiation , the BDT would be expected to shallow with arc maturity due to the warming caused by accumulated magmatism .
Our proposed mechanism for PCD generation is consistent with their intimate association with thick arcs .
For all of these hypotheses , oxidizing conditions are thought to be important in mobilizing Cu , but the origin of such oxidation is still unclear .
Hypotheses for the formation of porphyry copper deposits
Although rearward migration of the arc front is often attributed to a decrease in the angle of subduction ( e . g . , shallowing dip ; Haschke et al . , 2006 ) , a simpler explanation is that progressive thickening of the arc crust by magmatic inflation / underplating and tectonic shortening gradually forces the hot part of the mantle wedge to migrate away from the trench ( Dickinson , 1973 ; Karlstrom et al . , 2014 ) .
These similarities also suggest that the redox conditions in subarc mantle cannot be significantly different from that beneath mid - ocean ridge spreading centers .
To test this prediction , we looked to the central Andes , an active continental arc , to compare geochemical / geochronological data of magmas to the frequency of PCDs ( Sinclair , 2007 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
One potential factor may be the depth of the brittle - ductile transition ( BDT ) .
How - ever , we note that in nearly all of these island arc cases , the PCDs are associated with high Sr / Y magmas ( so - called adakitic signature ) .
In Fig . 10 , we have superimposed the frequency of PCDs in the central Andes on the temporal trends in geochemistry and arc front position using data from Sinclair ( 2007 ) and Haschke et al . ( 2006 ) .
However , a well - known , but unresolved paradox , is that arc magmas traversing thick crust , particularly in continental arcs , are generally depleted Cu whereas in island arcs , where PCDs are less common , magmas become enriched in Cu .
Again , consistent with this line of logic is the fact that deep crustal cumulates from continental arcs contain sulfide and have the high concentrations of Cu needed to complement the Cu - depleted continental arc magmas ( Jenner , 2017 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) ( Fig . 6 ) .
Over the last 80 My , there were two segments of magmatism in the central Andes ( 17 - 27 • S ) : between 30 - 80 Mya ( million years ago ) and from 20 Mya to the present ( Haschke et al . , 2006 ; Kay et al . , 2014 ; Mpodozis and Cornejo , 2012 ) .
These questions are similar to those being asked of how large volumes of crystal - poor silicic magmas can be extracted from a crystal mush and erupt ( Bachmann and Bergantz , 2004 ) .
Our model at face value may not be able to explain these occurrences , suggesting other " roads " to Cu mineralization in arc systems .
N - MORB - normalized multi - element diagrams show that the host rocks preserve negative anomalies of high field strength elements ( HFSEs ) that are typical of magmas generated in a supra - subduction zone setting .
The non - mineralized metavolcanic and dioritic rocks show variable signature of the large ion lithophiles 1 Journal Pre - proof ( LILEs ) , while the altered metavolcanic and dioritic rocks show a more consistent signature .
The dioritic and metavolcanic rocks altered to chlorite + illite in the Far Southeast , Honeycomb , Christine and Fatima porphyry deposits lost SiO2 and Al2O3 , while the concentrations of other elements remain relatively unchanged .
The pH - dependence of the geochemical behavior of Rb in hydrothermal conditions was utilized to construct new molar element ratios that could differentiate the rocks that underwent K - metasomatism either under near - neutral pH or acidic conditions .
Lithogeochemical techniques have been used increasingly in the recent years to aid mineral exploration ( e . g .
The original ferromagnesian minerals were altered to smectite and chlorite .
Sulfur was also added from the fluids to form alunite , which is the dominant alteration mineral . Alunite formation also accounts for the high K concentration of the rocks .
High Cu Journal Pre - proof concentrations of the samples can be due to the formation of either chalcopyrite , bornite and covellite , while the Pb can be fixed as galena , and Sb is incorporated in tetrahedrite - tennantite solid solution .
Barium and Sr increased in rocks altered by acid - sulfate fluids .
The Rb concentration of liquid - rich fluid inclusions in another pyrite generation range from 8 to 30 ppm , while the Rb concentrations of the liquid - rich fluid inclusions in enargite is at most 28 ppm ( Kouzmanov et al . 2010 ) .
The degree of gains of K in the dioritic and metavolcanic rocks affected by the near - neutral pH fluids and acid - sulfate fluids are almost similar ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The MERs existing in the literature were not able to differentiate between the alunite - altered metavolcanic rocks and dioritic rocks versus the diorite porphyry that were pervasively altered to illite ( Figs . 12A and 12B ) .
Mineralization occurs as gold - rich bornite or bornite - chalcopyrite dissemination and 21 We also looked at the geochemistry of the middle Miocene rhyolitic to rhyodacitic rocks of the Şaphane alunite deposit in western Anatolia , Turkey ( Mutlu et al . 2005 ) .
The concentration of Rb increases as the concentration of K of the granitoids and volcanic rocks of the Hugo Dummet deposit affected by potassic alteration increases ( Fig . 13A ) .
Cerium is the most abundant REE in the dioritic rocks and metavolcanic rocks in Lepanto , reaching concentrations above 20 ppm .
HREEs losses are observed in the rocks altered by acid - sulfate fluids .
Zirconium relatively immobile during the hydrothermal alteration .
The amounts of gains of LREE and loss of HREE oscillate with the atomic number , indicating that the amount leached by or taken up from the hydrothermal fluids were controlled by the amounts of REE in the precursor rocks .
The plagioclases in the dioritic porphyry of the FSE and Honeycomb were just partially altered , while the plagioclases in the dioritic porphyry of the Christine prospect were completely transformed to illite ( Fig . 2C ) .
The dioritic and metavolcanic rocks in Mankayan also contain slightly high Te concentration , which is consistent with the occurrence of copper , gold tellurides that have been previously reported ( Manalo et al . 2020 ) .
The different alteration types in the Hugo Dummet , El Salvador and Şaphane deposits can also be differentiated by the ( K + Rb ) / Al versus ( 2Ca + Na + K ) / Al diagram ( Fig . 13B ) , which is similar to the trend of the altered host rocks in the Mankayan District .
In near - neutral pH fluids , Rb was added to the host rocks , indicating the uptake of Rb from the hydrothermal fluid by K - feldspar or K - mica .
The mineralization is hosted in Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous plutonic rocks ( Porter et al . , 2016 ) .
The granitoids and the basaltic to dacitic volcanic rocks of the Hugo Dummet deposit that were altered under near - neutral pH conditions plots proximal to the dioritic rocks of the FSE deposits .
The rhyolitic rocks of the Şaphane deposit plot a little higher ( K + Rb ) / Al compared to the rest of the other samples but are within the range of the ( 2Ca + Na + K ) / Al values of the metavolcanic and dioritic rocks in Mankayan .
The hydrothermal fluids taken from geothermal wells and hot springs in Valles Caldera , New Mexico , Journal Pre - proof USA vary from neutral chloride fluids to acid - sulfate springs ( Michard 1989 ) .
The alteration caused by the acid - sulfate REE - bearing fluids enriched LREEs in the advanced argillic alteration zones .
The undulatory pattern in the losses from higher degree than the elements with odd atomic number .
In the Rb versus K diagram ( Fig . 13A ) , the concentrations of K are directly proportional in the diorite porphyry altered by near neutral pH fluids .
Common hydrothermal rare earth minerals are carbonates , phosphates and fluorides ( e . g .
There is little change Mg concentration of the dioritic rocks from FSE and Honeycomb , indicating that the alteration to chlorite almost conserved the original Mg concentration .
As for the acid - sulfate altered rocks , loss on ignition values increased after alteration due to the formation of hydrous secondary phases such as alunite and kaolinite .
The maximum Ce concentrations of neutral - chloride fluids with pH 7 are 70 parts per trillion ( ppt ) , 25 ppt and 2 . 8 ppt , respectively ( Michard 1989 ) .
The maximum Ce concentrations of neutral chloride fluids with pH 7 are 70 ppt , 30 ppt and 7 . 1 ppt , respectively ( Michard 1989 ) .
However , at very low concentrations of K ( < 0 . 02 mol ) , K and Rb contents are proportional in some acid - sulfate altered rocks .
The relatively fresh Lepanto Metavolcanics , Imbanguila Dacite and Bato Dacite show slight remobilization of LILEs .
Similarly , the basalts and the quartz monzodiorite of the Hugo Dummet deposit that were altered by acid sulfate fluids plot proximal to the dioritic and metavolcanic rocks of the Carmen , 22 Journal Pre - proof Florence and Fatima deposits .
This shows that Rb can substitute K in K - feldspars or micas , but not in alunite .
In general , the average gain REEs are more pronounced in the metavolcanic rocks and dioritic rocks affected by the acid alteration than in the dioritic rocks affected by near - neutral pH fluids .
The changes in the concentration of trace elements can be explained by looking at the geochemical affinity of these elements and seen if they could be accommodated into the crystal lattice of the alteration minerals .
He stated that the mineral assemblages , pH controls and respective water - rock ratios are generally similar across the three igneous rock compositions in fluid - dominant systems ( Reed , 1997 ) .
They concluded that Rb concentration increases twice to thrice than the original concentration after the 18 Journal Pre - proof precursor rocks were affected by potassic alteration ( Armbrust et al . 1977 ) .
On the other hand , Rb 26 Journal Pre - proof concentrations are depleted in host rocks with acid - sulfate alteration assemblages .
Looking at the likely initial concentration of the hydrothermal fluids , we refer to Michard ( 1989 ) who reported the concentrations of Ce , Nd , Sm , Eu , Gd , Dy , Er and Yb of the hydrothermal solutions in different geothermal fields .
Looking at the likely initial concentration of the hydrothermal fluids , we refer to Michard ( 1989 ) who reported the concentrations of Dy , Er and Yb of the hydrothermal solutions in different geothermal fields .
The non - mineralized Lepanto Metavolcanics and Imbanguila Dacite show flat REE pattern ( Fig . 3 ) , while the other hydrothermally - altered metavolcanic rocks and diorite porphyry show depletion in REEs ( Figs . 4 and 23 Journal Pre - proof 5 ) .
On the other hand , the K concentration of hypersaline polyphase fluid inclusions in pyrite within the high - sulfidation veins overprinting the Rosa - Poieni porphyry deposit ranges from 2 wt % to 4 . 5 wt % , as K ( Kouzmanov et al . 2010 ) .
The presence of relatively fresh rocks that are proximal to the mineralized zones with corresponding near - neutral pH assemblages , allowed the investigation of the effects of these different types of hydrothermal fluids to the mobility of the elements , with little concern that these rocks underwent different tectonic processes .
It also indicates that the REE composition of the acid - sulfate hydrothermal fluid would change after the reaction with the precursor rocks .
The overprinting episodes of porphyry - type mineralization in the Journal Pre - proof Mankayan District , northern Luzon , Philippines allows an investigation on variation of geochemical signatures with different alteration assemblages .
This is due to the originally higher and more variable Rb content of rhyolitic rocks ( Armbrust et al . 1977 ) .
Nevertheless , the depletion of Rb with respect to K is still evident in the Rb versus K diagram ( Fig . 13A ) , indicating that Rb is not incorporated in alunite crystal lattice despite its geochemical similarities with K . The trends observed from the plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Mankayan District , Hugo Dummet , Şaphane , El Salvador deposits indicate that the variation from mafic to felsic compositions have little effect on the product of hydrothermal alteration .

This study also reports that the geochemical behavior of Rb and K differs with respect to the type of hydrothermal fluids .
The differences in the amount of decrease in Na and Ca content among the dioritic rocks from FSE , Christine and Honeycomb can be explained by the degree of alteration of plagioclase .
Furthermore , we also compared the geochemical data metavolcanic and dioritic rocks in the Carmen and Florence prospects hosting quartz - pyrite - gold and enargite veins which overprinted earlier porphyry - type mineralization .
These techniques analyze different molar element ratios and relates the variation in concentration to material transfer processes that might have affected the rocks .
To assess the applicability of our new GER diagram to other deposits , we plotted the published whole - rock geochemical data of the Hugo Dummet orebody in the Oyu Tolgoi porphyry Cu - Au district , Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . 2008 ; Dolgopolova et al . 2013 ) .
Previous studies also concluded that the concentration of Rb in the rocks is not affected by weathering ( Goldschmidt 1954 ; Webber and Jellema 1965 ) , which could be used as an advantage in geochemical exploration in tropical areas ( Armbrust et al . 1977 ) .
Heier and Billings ( 1970 ) earlier noted that Rb prefers to be concentrated in micas compared to K - feldspars .
The average gains and losses diagrams show that the host rocks with near - neutral pH Journal Pre - proof alteration assemblage gained Rb with respect to the precursor rock ( Fig . 10A , 10B , 10C ) , while the host rocks with acid - sulfate alteration assemblage lost Rb ( Fig . 11A , 11B , 11C , 11D ) .
Journal Pre - proof We utilized the difference in the chemical behavior of Rb to differentiate the host rocks in MER diagrams .
From these previously reported data , we could infer that Rb concentration is ten times higher in the hypersaline brine that causes near - neutral pH alteration than that in the low to moderate salinity hydrothermal fluids that are generally associated with acid - sulfate alteration .
This study aims to lay the groundwork in elucidating the effects of an earlier hydrothermal activity on the characteristics manifested by subsequent mineralization events .
Olade and Fletcher 1975 ; Armbrust et al . 1977 ) , which are abundant in the host rocks of the FSE porphyry deposit , Christine prospect and Honeycomb prospect ( Imai 2000 ; this study ) .
Adakite was defined initially as the product of partial melting of subducted MORB ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) with or without involvement of the mantle wedge ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Rapp et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
Mineralization is essentially the enrichment forming elements .
Stabilization of sulfides indicates a low oxygen fugacity , which dramatically reduces the copper concentration , such that cannot necessarily result in Cu enrichment ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) .
The element partitioning of accumulated fractional melts is similar to batch melting process ( see Supplementary Material for the details of this model ) .
The partial melting degrees of mantle wedge , lower crust and slab melts to get the highest Cu concentration in melts increase from 3 % , through 6 % to 15 % .
The Cu concentration of the magma source can be constructed as : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Where is the Cu partition coefficient between fluid and melt ; , and are the Cu concentration of magma source , primitive fluid and the equilibrium melt , respectively ; and are the proportion of primitive fluid and melt , respectively .
As a parental magma of the mineralized porphyry , it was recently proposed that the Cu concentration is not a key factor for the Cu mineralization ( Chelle - Michou et al . , 2017 ) .
In the Phanerozoic , the South China block experienced large scale compression and deformation ( Wang et al . , 2013c ; Zhang et al . , 2013a ) .
In most igneous systems , copper partitions preferentially into sulfides over silicate melts , in the presence of sulfides ( Kiseeva and Wood , 2013 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ) .
The three mineralized porphyries in the Dexing deposit are granodiorite stocks mainly consisting of plagioclase , quartz , K - feldspar , amphibole and biotite , with magnetite , apatite , titanite , ilmenite and zircon as accessory minerals .
The special geochemical signature of porphyry magma ( like high Sr / Y and La / Yb raitos ) makes it essential to reiterate melts ' compositions and behavior of sulfides at these fO 2 conditions .
In general , hydrothermal activity may enrich ore forming elements by factors of tens up to hundreds times .
The estimated zircon oxygen fugacities of porphyry Cu deposits in the world with various tonnage ( from 95 Mt in El Teniente to 1 . 5 Mt in Shaxi ) are high ( ~ ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 on average ) .
Similarly , both slab melting ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) and partial melting of thickened lower crust ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ; Asadi et al . , 2014 ; Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009b ; Hou et al . , 2015 ) have been proposed for porphyry mineralization .
This goes back to slab melting for Cu enrichment , anyway , which emphasizes the necessity of the subducted oceanic slab .
As mentioned above , porphyry Cu deposits usually form at depths of 2 - 4 km ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , whereas the solubility of water increases with increasing pressure .
Although the origin of Cu mineralized porphyry magma is still in debate ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Richards , 2009Richards , , 2013Sun et al . , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , most parental magmas of porphyry possess high Sr / Y ratios , which are also important characteristics for adakite and adakitic magmas .
Our modeling shows that partial melting of subducted oceanic crust , under oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 , is favorable for producing primary magmas with Cu contents sufficiently high for porphyry mineralization , which plausibly explains the close relationship between porphyry Cu deposits and oxidized magmas with adakitic affinities .
In summary , the initial Cu content is an important parameter and slab melts is the best candidate for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
In this scenario , 5 - 30 % partial melting of subducted slab under an oxygen fugacity higher than FMQ + 1 . 5 produces melts with high Cu ( 390 ppm ) , Sr / Y and La / Yb , features that are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Under high oxygen fugacity , sulfate is the stable phase ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , which allows release of Cu into the melt during melting , and allows chalcophile metals to be extracted into silicate melts and fluids ( Kiseeva and Wood , 2013 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ) .
Previous authors proposed that subducted sediments was the major components for Dexing adaktie based on Pb isotope ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) .
We also modeled the effects of oxygen fugacity on partial melting lower crust and mantle peridotite for Cu .
It , therefore , was argued that normal arc rocks may form porphyry Cu deposits through addition of water ( Richards , 2011 ) .
The relationship suggests that the Dexing porphyry magma highly oxidized when the Jurassic magmatic zircons crystallized ( estimated fO 2 : ΔFMQ + 0 . 7 ( ± 1 . 3 ) - ΔFMQ + 1 . 9 ( ± 1 . 3 ) ) , which cannot be attributed to partial melting of the Neoproterozoic arc crust ( estimated fO 2 : ΔFMQ - 2 . 4 ( ± 1 . 1 ) - ΔFMQ + 0 . 7 ( ± 1 . 2 ) ) as proposed previously .
Previous modeling results show that partial melting of mantle peridotite under high oxygen fugacity ( even at > ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) cannot form Cu - rich magmas , which plausibly explains the lack of porphyry Cu deposits in normal arc rocks .
On the contrary , the same degree of lower crust partial melting leads to a much higher Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ( Fig .
As shown in this study , although the high H 2 O condition has some impact on the porphyry mineralization , it is normal for all rocks at convergent margins .
This makes it very difficult channelize the ore - forming fluids to the orebody efficiently .
In contrast , large degrees ( up to 90 % ) of partial melting of the lower continental crust is necessary to produce magmas with high La / Yb magmas , and these magmas would have low Cu content ( < 75 ppm ) even under a high oxygen fugacity and there would be an unsuitable source for producing porphyry Cu deposits .
Sample preparation and trace element analysis of zircon Fresh granodiorite samples collected from Tongchang and Fujiawu mines ( Fig . 1C ) were crushed to ~ 6 for trace element and U - Pb isotopic measurements , which were obtained using laser ablation inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA - ICPMS ) at the Guangzhou Institute of 7 3 .
The results of our model illustrate the importance of fO 2 in the source of the parental magmas of mineralized porphyries ( Fig . 7 ) .
In the accumulated fractional melting model of this study , the melt increment ( 0 . 01 % ) instantaneously extracts from the system and equilibrates with the mineral assemblage residues , then aggregates to form accumulated melts .
Remarkably , there isn ' t an obvious correlation between the Cu reserve and oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that the fO 2 of FMQ + 1 . 5 is the threshold for Cu enrichment in melts ( Fig . 7 ) , whereas the tonnage depends also on many other factors , e . g . , the amount of slab melts , the efficiency of hydrothermal enrichment , the geologic settings that enable the storage , preservation and exposure of the porphyry deposits , etc .
K - silicate alteration , subdivided into early K - feldspar alteration and late biotite alteration ( dominant ) , mainly affected the central quartz monzonite and adjacent coarse - grained quartz diorite and fine - grained quartz diorite .
Molybdenite Re - Os dating shows that mineralization in the district occurred at 216 . 54 ± 0 . 87 to 216 . 13 ± 0 . 86 Ma .
The Pulang district was discovered by a joint venture between Billiton PLC and the Yunnan Bureau of Exploration in the 1990s ( Li et al . , 2011 ) .
The initial ore fluids exsolved from the causative oxidized magma in porphyry deposits inherit the high oxidation states of the magma , with a full comple - ment of ore metals .
The associated ore fluids are also oxidized , as indicated by the presence of abundant hydrothermal anhydrite in association with hypogene copperiron sulfides ( Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
The oxidized nature of the causative magma and ore fluids at Pulang helps to explain why it is a giant deposit—reduced porphyry deposits are typically small in terms of contained Cu ( Rowins , 2000 ; Shen and Pan , 2015 ) .
Commonly , SHRIMP / SIMS zircon U - Pb dating is accurate with an external error of ~ 1 % ( Ire - land and Williams , 2003 ) , much better than the LA - ICP - MS method ( 2 relative standard deviation [ RSD ] = ~ 4 % ; Klötzli et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2015 ) .
However , the Pulang intrusions have undergone extensive hydrothermal alteration , and K - Ar / Ar - Ar isotope systems are susceptible to such alteration whereas zircon U - Pb isotope systems remain closed and yield more reliable ages for the porphyries .
The pres - ence of carbonaceous slates as wall rocks at Pulang provided a local reductant that stabilized pyrrhotite during chlorite - illite and quartz - illite alteration .
Several aspects of the Pulang deposits consequently remain poorly understood , and the genesis of the district is therefore controversial .
Therefore , we consider our molyb - denite Re - Os dates to be the best estimates for the timing of main - stage mineralization at South Pulang .
Previous work has also suggested that Pulang is a reduced , rather than an oxidized , porphyry Cu - Au system , based on the local presence of pyrrhotite and CH Wang et al . , 2014 ) .
The spatial and temporal relationships of porphyry intrusions , hydrothermal alteration , various vein types , and associated mineralization in the Pulang Cu - Au district were established based on detailed geologic investigation .
Using the size classification of Singer ( 1995 ) , Pulang is the only giant porphyry Cu deposit in the Yidun arc and is one of the largest porphyry Cu deposits in China .
The significant date variations shown in Figure 16 may reflect the complexity of ages that the zircon grains record ( e . g . , complex magmatic evolution history ; Chelle - Michou et al . , 2014 ) and / or unaccounted analytical bias inherent in microbeam analysis , such as uncertainty in the isotopic ratio measurements , uncertainty in the fractionation factor calcula - tion using an external standard , and uncertainty in the data reduction ( Li et al . , 2015 ) .
This conclusion is based on the following three lines of evidence : ( 1 ) East and South Pulang are hosted in the same coarse - grained quartz diorite stock ; ( 2 ) no biotite - altered slates have been found between East and South Pulang , whereas extensive biotite - altered slates occur between South and North Pulang ( KPDI , 2014 ) ; and ( 3 ) 15 subparallel orebodies at East Pulang are controlled by E - striking structures , and abundant faults and joints with similar strike have been widely observed in the pits at South Pulang ( KPDI , 2014 ) .
The classic porphyry - style alteration zona - tion pattern of Lowell and Guilbert ( 1970 ) does not apply to Pulang , in which epidote - chlorite alteration extends from the deposit core outward and has strongly overprinted early K - silicate alteration .
Cenozoic ridge subduction and the resultant slab windows have been well documented worldwide , especially along the western margins of North and South America .
Many adakitic rocks have been described in the slab window of West Junggar , and we know there are relevant hydrothermal vent Cu - Au deposits in West Junngar , but so far no symmetrical zonation of the deposits has been defined , which would help to confirm and constrain the slab window .
This survey shows that the CAOB contains many examples of ridge subduction and slab windows primarily in West Junggar and the Chinese Altai , and less commonly in East Junggar , Beishan , the Tianshan , Kyrgyzstan , the Russian Altai , Inner Mongolia and Alxa .
The key magmatic products are adakites that include plutonic and volcanic rocks with intermediate - to high - SiO2 , high La / Yb ratios , elevated MgO , Na2O , K2O , Ni hornblende / biotite - bearing high - Mg diorites , and granodiorites to hornblende / pyroxene and Cr contents , and high LILE and LREE elements .
One generation was orthogonal to an ophiolite - strewn paleotrench ( suture ) , and the second was parallel to a transform fault that was parallel to the paleo - trench .
When a ridge approaches a trench and eventually subducts beneath it , it may lead to hot asthenosphere beneath the forearc , generating mixed metasomatized crust - mantle and associated HT / UHT metamorphism .
When an ocean opens and closes , it is inevitable that a mid - oceanic ridge ( Searle , 2013 ) will travel with its pelagic sediments on it across the ocean to a trench where it may be accreted and / or subducted , giving rise to a unique geodynamic and geochemical environment ( DeLong and Fox , 1977 ) .
The dikes provide the best evidence so far for the orientation and opening of a slab window in the CAOB , and for the relative movement directions of the downgoing and overriding plates during the subduction and closure of swarms of late Carboniferous high - Mg hornblende - biotite diorite dykes with sanukitoid the Paleo - Asian Ocean .
They are typically associated with a wide variety of coeval and compositionally diverse volcanic and plutonic rocks such as high - Ca boninites , tholeiitic , high - T basalts , alkaline basalts , charnockites , peraluminous TTGs , I - type granites , and mid - ocean ridge ( MOR ) ( not supra - subduction ) ophiolites .
There are several unique or diagnostic features that can individually be used to define unambiguously a ridge subduction event , but a combination of multiple indicators and the resultant features , outlined below , will lead to a more robust assessment .
Thus , the presence in accretionary or collisional orogens of OPS floored by MOR basalts provides another major indicator of ridge subduction .
Sample catchment basin modeling increases the prediction rate of mineral deposits as well .
Modeling of geochemical anomalies especially in stream sediment data is another challenging issue because the materials of each stream sample have upstream sources ( Spadoni , 2006 ; Carranza , 2008 ) .
In this regard , multi - element associations of Zn - Pb , As - Sb , and Au - Ag - Cu - Mo have been used as indicators for prospecting porphyry - Cu deposits in different areas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Weixuan et al . , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ; Yousefi et al . , 2012 ) , but in the study area the Zn - Pb and As - Sb associations have not shown positive spatial association with the deposit - type sought , and so , they are not significant geochemical signatures for the deposit .
For this , we used staged factor analysis proposed by Yousefi et al . ( 2012Yousefi et al . ( , 2014 with robust estimation of covariance matrix ( Pison et al . , 2003 ; Filzmoser et al . , 2009b ) .
In this regard , because element associations are affected by the diversity of geological characteristics of different areas , it is important to analyze and recognize significant geochemical signatures that represent the deposit - type sought .
In the study area of this paper , geochemical signatures of GMPI Pb - Zn ( Figs . 4 , 7 ) and GMPI As - Sb ( Figs . 5 , 8 ) show distal halos from the outcropping mineralized zones .
As demonstrated in this paper , the Au - Ag - Cu - Mo association is a strong geochemical signature for the deposit - type sought .
By using these processes , we recognized the best geochemical signature of the deposit - type sought in the study area .
Various studies have applied contour mapping and SCB for modeling geochemical anomalies using stream sediment data ( e . g . , Hawkes , 1976 ; Bonham - Carter et al . , 1987 , 1988Carranza , 2004Carranza , , 2008Carranza , , 2010a .
The proposed methods in this paper can efficiently be used in other areas to recognize significant geochemical signatures of different types of mineral deposits .
