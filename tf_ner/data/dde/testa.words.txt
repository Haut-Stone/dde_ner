Metallogenesis related tomes - and Neo - Tethyan evolution
The asthenosphere upwelling after the removal is an efficient mechanism to trigger the partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust .
The partial melting metasomatized lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust was responsible for the production of highly oxidized magma and corresponding formation of Cu - Au - Mo ore deposits upon the previous subduction zone .
The fault control on the mineralization is in conformity with the Ar - Ar isochron age ~ 27 Ma of phlogopite from the mineralized lamprophyre , which intruded at ~ 35 Ma , representing the main mineralization stage ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) .

Orebodies are predominantly banded quartz veins , which are strictly controlled by bedding faults .
Abundant Fe - Ti oxide ore deposits are associated with less evolved basaltic magma in the Emeishan large igneous province than elsewhere in the world and the difference is attributed to selective assimilation newly subducted , stagnant oceanic lithospheric slab by the ascending mantle plume - derived picritic magma that was originally undersaturated with Fe - Ti oxides ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .

The spreading of Meso - Tethyan Ocean separated the W . Qiangtang and Sibumasu blocks from late - Permian , and the closure of the main Paleo - Tethyan Ocean caused the amalgamation blocks as well as the earlier separated blocks ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) .
Later lithospheric thinning , usually caused by delamination , resulted in the generation granitoid magma characterized by varied and generally lower whole - rock Sr / Y ratios ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2015a ; .

The E - W - trending metallogenic belt , located in the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton ( Fig . 16 ) , hosts two major types of ore deposits : porphyry - skarn - stratabound Cu - Au - Mo - Fe deposits with an age range of 137 - 143 Ma and apatite - magnetite ( or magnetite porphyry ) deposits with ages of 125 - 123 Ma ( Mao et al . , 2006 , Mao et al . , 2011b .
The 40 Ar / 39 Ar plateau age for biotite from the potassic alteration in the Luoboling Cu - Mo deposit in the Zijinshan is 105 ± 2 Ma ( Zhang et al . , 2003b ) , which is the same as the Re - Os isochron age of 104 . 9 ± 1 . 6 Ma for molybdenite separates from the deposit ( Liang et al . , 2012 ) .
The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting of metasedimentary rocks in the overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The regional lithospheric extension may have been the driving force for generation and emplacement of the mafic / crust derived magmas , which induced partial melting of the overlying crustal materials to produce felsic magmas ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) .
The zircon εHf ( t ) values Dexing metallogenic granites suggests that the magma was derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust , formed through thickened lithospheric mantle delamination at ~ 160 Ma in an intracontinental setting Wang et al . , 2015b ) .

The superimposed orogeny is best exemplified by the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ) orogenic belts , which comprise blocks separated from Gondwana through the opening of Paleo - Neo - Tethyan oceans ( Fig . 5 ) .
The subduction main Paleo - Tethyan oceanic crust and those of its branches generated arc magmatism as well as S - type granitoids ( Figs . stage , after the lithosphere has been thickened , the lithospheric mantle was removed leading to the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism in the northern margin of Tibet and Sanjiang belts during 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2005 ; ) .
The metallogenic types in these two types of orogenesis are also different .
The remelting Neoproterozoic juvenile crust resulted in the metal - carrying magma , ( Fig . 19d ) and the metamorphism of juvenile crust during continental lithospheric subduction of Yangtze Craton and concomitant crustal shearing was deduced to release gold - rich metamorphic fluid ( Fig . 19c ) . Another important fact for the spatial preferences is the lithosphere structure vulnerable to tectonic reactivation and relatively high crust permeability .
The reactivation of ancient deep faults or syn - depositional faults formed in the previous tectonic regimes was favorable for the transportation fluids .
The analysis on the geochemical characteristics of ore - forming granitoids from the different tectonic units displayed that the superimposed orogeny exerted significant control on the source metallogenic granitoid and the associated metal species ( Figs . 6 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 and 17 ) . During the early orogenic phase of the superimposed orogenic system , mantle melt contributed to the formation of juvenile mafic lower crust , resulting in formation of Cudominant ore deposits .
The different sources and proportions of magma mixing yielded three potential sources that caused a large variation combinations .
The reactivation ancient sutures , craton margins and arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal , eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) . Precursor subduction - related magmatism is important because such processes leave ore - metal enriched residue in cumulate zones within the juvenile crust , which can be re - mobilized during later partial melting .

Fig . 7 Geological map of the Northeast China blocks ( Zhou and Wilde , 2013 ; Xu et al . , 2015b ) illustrating the tectonic units and the space - time information ore deposits .
Earlier studies linked the Yanshanian volcanism in the Great Xing ' an Range with ages peaking at Ma ( Fig . 7 ) to the west - to - east migrating delamination processes and associated magmatic underplating ( e . g . , Wang et al . , 2006a ) .
In a few cases , different metallogenic processes mutual interference in one metallogenic belt under the same tectonic setting , called one - period composite metallogenic system .
This generally explains the evolution of felsic magma - related ore metal associations proceeding during the superimposed orogeny .
The meta - igneous rocks are enriched LREE and depleted in high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta and Ti , have geochemical signatures that are similar to those of arc volcanic rocks .
The geodynamic engine of the Jiaodong - type Au deposit is considered to be oceanic subduction coupled with lithospheric thinning ( Zhu et al . , 2015a with structural control in the shallow crust .
Later at ~ 32 to 27 Ma , the large - scale continental underthrust resulted in the release of regional metamorphic fluid , bringing gold out the juvenile crust and forming the orogenic Au deposits in the Ailaoshan shear system along the western margin of South China Block ( Fig . 19 ) . The Cu - Au - Mo metallogenic porphyries in the Beiya ( No .
The rollback of the subducted Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab caused the magmatism with ages from 55 to 45 Ma in the Gangdese arc belt in southern Tibet ( Chung et al . , 2005 ( Chung et al . , , 2009 .
The earlier to later phase of granites low K calc - alkaline series to high - K calc - alkaline and shoshonitic series , and the associated metal species changed from Cu - dominant to Mo - dominant .
It is thus concluded that the ancient lower crust has contributed Mo into the parental magma , and the involvement of mantle or juvenile crust melt induced complex metal associations and lowered A / CNK values .
50 ) formed at ~ 35 Ma in the western margin of the South China Block ( Fig . 14 ) , the most positive zircon εHf ( t ) values are concentrated at the hafnium evolution line of 0 . 9 Ga .
It has been suggested that the Sijiaying BIF formed in a back - arc or arc basin setting in Neoarchean .
There are various triggers for superimposed orogeny on the scale of global tectonics .
This is similar to those in the Beiya Au deposit ( No .
Recent research reveals that the Precambrian ore deposits were party subjected to secondary re - mobilization .
Geochemically , the granites are strongly peraluminous , with high contents of alkalis , belonging to highly fractionated S - type granites ( Fig . 17 ) .
160 Ma granitic porphyries in the Jiguanshan Mo deposit ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
The zircon εHf ( t ) values in the peraluminous granitoids associated with Mo mineralization from the southern margin the North China Craton are clustered around the evolution line of 2 . 0 Ga with a few plots scattered around 3 . 0 - 4 . 0 Ga ( Fig . 9 ) ( summarized in Supplementary File C ) .
For instance , at least four major metallogenic events Gangdese porphyry Cu belt Lhasa Block ( Fig . 12 ) .
It should be emphasized that in the granitoid - related intracontinental ore deposits sources , such as the Gejiu , Dexing , and Beiya , syn - mineralization mafic dikes are also associated , including diabase and lamprophyre , in both time and space .
It was therefore considered that the consecutive ocean opening and northward migration blocks from the Gondwana margins was driven by the previous oceanic subduction ( Deng et al . , 2015a ) .
The geochemical compositions with the Mo - carrying granitoid in the ore deposits Mujicun , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , show the metallogenic granitoid are high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic ( Fig . 9 ) .
The geochemical compositions with the Mo - carrying granitoid in the ore deposits , including Jinduicheng , Mujicun , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , show the metallogenic granitoid shoshonitic ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has been proposed that two pairs of Paleo - Tethyan sutures , the LongmuTso - Shuanghu and Changning - Menglian ( [ 17 ] ) and Jinshajiang and Ailaoshan ( [ 23 ] ) are developed with comparable magmatic and sedimentary records ( Deng et al . , 2014a ) .
Nanling and adjacent areas , forming a NE - trending cluster ( Fig . 16 ) .
Despite this , a large population of the εHf ( t ) values in Yulong cluster at the 0 . 9 - 1 . 0 Ga line .
The results suggest the lithosphere of the eastern North China Craton was subjected to more extensive thinning and destruction as compared with that in the central part ( Shen et al . , 2013b ) .
The former is largely found within several ore clusters at the intersections of NE - and EW - trending faults in southeastern Hubei , Jiurui , Anqing - Guichi , Tongling and Ningzheng provinces .
The ore deposits in this period include the BIF , VMS ore deposit ranging from Archean , late - Paleoproterozoic , to Neo - Proterozoic ( Fig . 8 ) .
These geochemical features indicate that the porphyry belongs to the adakite type , which was derived from a thickened crust with the presence of garnet .
Geochronological and geochemical features of the Jurassic ore - bearing porphyries in the 161 . 5 ± 2 . 7 Ma , consistent with the emplacement times of their host plutons .
Zircon grains of the ore - forming intrusions show highly negative εHf ( t ) values ranging from −18 to −26 and −20 to −35 and significantly old model ages ranging of 2 . 3 to 3 . 5 Ga . For other Mo deposits formed in late Cretaceous , like Jinduicheng , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , the co - magmatic zircons in the oreforming intrusions displays highly negative εHf ( t ) .
Zircon grains of the ore - forming intrusions show highly negative εHf ( t ) values ranging from −18 to −26 and −20 to −35 and significantly old model ages ranging of 2 . 3 to 3 . 5 Ga . For other Mo deposits Jinduicheng , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , the co - magmatic zircons in the oreforming intrusions displays highly negative εHf ( t ) .
This is consistent with the development of several layers with high metal concentrations in the basins .
200 - 100 Ma granitoids in Xing ' an associated with Mo ( Cu ) deposits have zircon εHf ( t ) values between the hafnium isotopic evolution lines of 0 . 4 Ga and 1 . 5 Ga , and their Sr / Y ratios change from 100 to 0 . 1 .
64 ) formed at 1 . 166 ± 0 . 02Ma , according to the Ar - Ar plateau age hydrothermal sericite , in the eastern margin of the block .
It is reasonable to consider that the incorporation of mantle melt , besides the juvenile crust contribution , accounted for the shift in εHf ( t ) Yulong ore belt .

5 ) located at the southern margin of the Chinese Altai occurs in metamorphic acid volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of Devonian Kangbutiebao Formation and are faultcontrolled ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment during the previous subduction - and later collision - related magmatic events in the Lhasa block provide important insights into mineral potential .
Examples of the dominant types of superimposed orogeny in China include : ( 1 ) Cenozoic continental collision superimposed on Paleo - to Mesozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet and Sanjiang orogenic belts ; ( 2 ) Reactivation of Paleozoic accretionary orogen in later Mesozoic oceanic subduction in the eastern part of Qinling–Qilian–Kunlun and Central Asian orogenic belts ; ( 3 ) Mesozoic oceanic subduction under the paleo - suture in the South China Block ; ( 4 ) Mesozoic demantling along the Paleo - and Neoproterozoic , and Paleozoic sutures in the eastern part of North China Craton ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab .

Their old T DM C ages , peraluminous to metaluminous affinity , and the associated Cu - dominant mineralization , suggesting the crustal source were most likely composed of mafic juvenile crust originated from mantle , since the period of 2 . 85 Ga to 2 . 40 Ga was an important stage for crust growth via oceanic subduction in the craton .
2 ) contains > 500 million metric tons of sulfide ores with grades of 1 . 1 wt . % Ni and 0 . 7 wt . % Cu , and is the largest single magmatic Ni - Cu sulfide ore deposit in the world ( Li and Ripley , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) .
The metallogeny in this craton started from Precambrian and reached the climax in late Cretaceous with the formation of the Jiaodongtype gold deposits and porphyry Mo deposits .
From regional geology , lithologic association , and geochemical features of the associated meta - volcanics and orthogneisses , previous studies suggested that the highgrade BIF formed initially in arcs , which were intruded by voluminous tonalities and granodiorites , and later converted by deformation and high - grade metamorphism into orthogneisses .
Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Degassing of oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .
Porphyry deposits are hosts to one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , accounting for ~ 80 % Cu and ~ 95 % Mo of the world ' s total reserves .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Porphyry Cu deposits almost do have systematically higher oxygen fugacities and FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
Porphyry Au deposits have oxygen fugacities similar to , if not higher than , porphyry Cu deposits .
Chuquicamata is another supergiant porphyry deposit in Chile , with a total reserve of ~ 106 Mt Cu @ 0 . 71 % , 1 . 81 Mt Mo @ 0 . 024 % and 301 t Au @ 0 . 04 g / t ( Table 1 .
Zircon U - Pb dating shows that the formation ages of deposits within the Yulong ore belt range from 41 . 2 to 36 . 9 Ma , extending over a period of similar to 4 . 3 Ma , with formation ages decreasing systematically from northwest to southeast ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .
Porphyry Mo deposits
Climax - type Mo deposit in the world , with total proven Mo reserves of over 2 . 2 million metric tons @ 0 . 17 wt . % .
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , the behaviors of which are mainly controlled by reduced sulfur , e . g . , sulfide , hydrosulfide complexes ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or polysulfide ( e . g . , S 2 2− , S 3 − ) complexes ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Partial melting mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Hydrogen may further react with CO 2 and / or O 2 ( Eqs .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes metal resources .
Reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are : 17 Mile Hill , Western Australia ; the Minãs de San Anton , Mexico ( Rowins , 2000 ) ; the Baogutu , northwestern China ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010aShen et al . , , 2012 ; North Fork Deposit , west Central Cascades , western North America ( Smithson and Rowins , 2005 ) ; Catface ; Vancouver Island , British Columbia ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; and a few other small porphyry deposits ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .
Oxidized Mt Washington adakite was emplaced at 41 - 35 . 3 Ma during the subduction of the west limb ridge , bringing more ore forming fluids into the Catface porphyry .
Oxidized adakitic ( slab melts rocks are overwhelmingly the most favorable candidates for porphyry mineralizations .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent by processes melting , crystallization , assimilation , degassing , etc ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 .
Increasing Zn Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .
Thick continental arcs are more favorable for porphyry mineralization because of accumulation sulfide cumulates ; ( B ) after Wilkinson ( 2013 ) , which also proposes that sulfide saturation and accumulation are very important for the formation of porphyry Cu deposits ; ( C ) after Richards ( 2011b ) , illustrating porphyry and epithermal mineralizations in arc and postcollisional settings ; ( D ) after Richards ( 2013 ) , highlighting features or processes that may result in supercharging of these systems to form giant deposits .
Crystallization of sulfide cannot explain this phenomenon , because Ni and Pt are even more chalcophile than Cu , with partition coefficients between sulfide melts of several hundreds and more than 20 thousand , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Metals can be leached out as far as there is enough water circulation .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Partial melting of thickened eclogitic lower continental crust ( Wang et al . , 2006a ( Wang et al . , , b , 2007aZhang et al . , 2001a ) and fractional crystallization amphibole ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) may also form high Sr / Y magmas .
High water contents in magmas may suppress the crystallization plagioclase , and promote the formation of amphibole , resulting in high Sr / Y signatures ( Richards , 2011a ( Richards , , 2012 .
Oceanic crust has a much higher Cu abundance ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than the mantle ( 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) or the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Subduction of young ridges , both spreading and aseismic , in particular , produces adakites with high oxygen fugacity , making it the best geological process for porphyry Cu deposits ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
Alterations
Sodic calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits .
Dominant mineral changes from biotite in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , to K - feldspar in more granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration produces pale green rocks and is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , overprinting preexisting potassic assemblages .
Sulfate is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide .
Degassing is not the main process in deeply emplaced porphyry bodies , such that it is not likely to be a major process for sulfate reduction , either .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 or higher , only 5 % partial melting is needed to remove all the residual sulfides , forming melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 2000 ppm .
At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
The heterogeneous deposit are attributed to significant country - rock contamination after emplacement ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) in an arc setting ( Shen et al . , 2013a , b ) .
The oxygen fugacity of the mantle and volcanic arc has been under study for a long time ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Cottrell and Kelley , 2013 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ) .
The solubility sulfides high , with partition coefficients of ~ 500 ( Keppler , 2010 ) .
The highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
A . Porphyry deposits are formed in normal arc rocks ( after Richards , 2011a ) .
The highly oxidized nature of porphyry magmas have been reported in essentially all types of porphyries ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ; , including porphyry Cu Cu - Au deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , porphyry Au deposits , to porphyry Cu - Mo deposits ( Cuadra and Rojas , 2001 ; Lynch and Ortega , 1997 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) and pure porphyry Fig . 6 .
The Tongshankou porphyry skarn Cu - Au deposit , in the Lower Yangtze River belt , central eastern China , also has primary hematite next to sulfides ( Li et al . , 2008 ) .
The most famous porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are the Cenozoic ones located along the eastern Pacific margin .
The porphyry is an adakite formed at ~ 170 Ma ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2006a , b ) .
The Yulong porphyry is the largest one in the Yulong copper deposit belt , with reserves of N7 . 14 Mt of Cu @ 0 . 84 % and 0 . 15 Mt of Mo @ 0 . 028 % ( Table 1 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
The oxygen fugacity can also reach the HM buffer during sulfate reduction and mineralization ( Fig . 10 ) , likely because of the lower FeO contents .
The oxygen fugacities of convergent margin magmas are systematically higher than those of intraplate settings .
The oxidation of ferrous iron by sulfate leads to a decreases in pH in ore - forming fluids within the porphyry system ( Eq .
The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .
The resulting adakites may then have been reduced through reaction with the thick ( maximum thickness of 4 km ) carbon - rich Cretaceous Nanaimo Group sediments ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) as they migrated upward .
The Baogutu adakites have been attributed to the mixing of ~ 95 % slab melt with 5 % sediment derived melt in the Late Carboniferous close to a subducting spreading ridge ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) .
The magnetite crisis refers to the dramatic decreases in Cu and Au during magnetite crystallization in arc volcanic rocks ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is a common phenomenon ( Moss et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Togashi and Terashima , 1997 ) .
The sulfide phase contains high Au and Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements Ni , Re , and Pt .
The chalcopyrite ± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones .
The alteration is characterized by transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low acid - buffering capacities ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
This oxygen buffer technique was first developed by Eugster in 1957 to prevent oxidation iron during growth of hydrous ferrous silicates and then later to determine the stability of annite ( Eugster , 1957 ; Eugster and Wones , 1962 ; Wones and Eugster , 1965 ) .
Many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have high sulfate contents , with much less magnetite .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
These Cu - rich sulfides may evolve into porphyry mineralization or even control the ore - forming process .
These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
These ridges were mostly younger 25 Ma when they began to subduct , and are closely associated with large porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 27 ) .
How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
Why are porphyry deposits usually associated with oxidized magmas , which is a situation so different from Ni–Cu sulﬁde deposits that clearly experienced sulﬁde saturation ?
For the mantle wedge subducting slabs , the estimated S content at sulfide saturation ranges from 1500 ppm ( at ΔFMQ + 0 . 4 ) to 4500 ppm ( at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
2014 ) : Mantle derived magmas ( red ) intrude into the cold upper plate ( black ) of subduction zones , generating crystallizing magma chambers .
Although reduced porphyry deposits are rare , with tonnages much smaller than oxidizing porphyry deposits ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , the mechanism needs to be clariﬁed .
( 11 ) , degassing of SO 2 indeed consumes oxygen , such that it may lower the oxygen fugacity of the system .
Although most of the porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas , a small group of porphyry deposits are reported as apparently related to reduced magmas with oxygen fugacities ranging from ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Fig . 19 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The final porphyry mineralization is controlled by sulfate reduction , which is usually initiated by magnetite crystallization , accompanied by decreasing pH and correspondingly increasing oxidation potential of sulfate .
However , degassing of SO 2 cannot reduce Fig . 16 .
Given that volcanic systems are far more open , the initial Cu , Au contents are not of critical importance to porphyry mineralization .
There are porphyry ore deposits located at the southwestern Pacific margin , which , however , are much less developed in terms of tonnage and the number deposits .
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .
Given that porphyry magmas highly oxidized , reaction ( 21 ) is not likely to occur .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Many large porphyry Cu - Au deposits are connected to subduction aseismic ridges ( Fig . 27 ) ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Therefore , degassing of SO 2 cannot explain the features of reduced porphyries .
Therefore , Cu , Mo and Au act as moderately incompatible ele - ments ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , which become enriched during the early stage of magma evolution , and suddenly go into magmatic ﬂuids during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013a ) .
First , the oxygen fugacity Ni - NiO is quite close to the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of the hydrothermal vessel ( NiNiO + 0 . 5 ) .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
Meanwhile , sulfide is kept undersaturated during the evolution of the oxidized magma , such that no sulfide segregation occurs , and Cu , Mo , and Au act as moderately incompatible elements .
The further oxidation of magnetite is controlled by the pH values of the system ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Most of the C in magma occurs as CO 2 , therefore the oxygen buffer changes from graphite - CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + Fe 2 + equilibria as the magma ascends ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .
All types of porphyry deposits , ranging from Cu + Au deposits , may be oxidized sufficiently to reach the redox states of the HM buffer .
Although the tonnages oxidized porphyry deposits , the mechanism that controls these mineralization process needs to be clarified .
However , at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , ~ 5 - 10 % of partial melting is enough to eliminate residual sulfide from the subducted oceanic crust , forming adakitic melts with high Cu S contents up to 2000 ppm and percent levels , respectively .
The amount of H + released during mineralization and the alkali content in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation alterations .
The supergiant El Teniente deposit in Chile is the largest porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit in the world , with total reserves of ~ 109 Mt Cu @0 . 92 % , 2 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 02 % and 437 t Au @0 . 035 g / t ( Table 1 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
For example , ilmenite is an end - member of the hematite - ilmenite solid solutions with a very low hematite component , varying from X Hem ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 ) , for the Catface phase and X Hem ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 09 ) for the Hecate Bay phase ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
First , lower Cu and Au contents would first result in lower grade , not necessarily smaller tonnages .
We infer that large proportions adakites are still buried due to the dramatically lessened compression , uplifting and erosion following ridge subduction .
In contrast , oceanic crust has sulfur abundances of over 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , which is about 4 times greater than the primitive mantle value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control K + / H + ratio magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .
Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu Mariana arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation porphyry deposits .
It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .

The lower portion of argillic lithocaps may overprint the upper parts of the porphyry Cu deposits , whereas the sericitic alteration transforms upwardly to quartz - pyrophyllite .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .
Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulﬁde .
In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
Some workers proposed that ΔFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ΔFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature magmas .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .
It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
This is probably true along the western margin North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .
Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction of S 3 − ( Eq .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
( 3 ) What is the genetic connection between high oxygen fugacity magmas and porphyry deposits ?
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .
Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea floor degassing .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene magnetite and hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non erupting pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
( 17 ) ) : SO 2− 4 þ 8Fe 3 O 4 ¼ 12Fe 2 O 3 þ S 2− : ð17Þ The formation of hydrothermal hematite will further lower the pH , whereas further oxidation of magnetite will not change the pH .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .
CH 4 þ 4Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 8FeO þ CO 2 þ 2H 2 Oð29Þ Considering that the Catface porphyry is not adakitic , it may well be simply the country rock that hosts the deposit .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes copper and a variety of other metal resources .
It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaﬁei et al . , 2009 ) .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .
tion : ln XFe2 O3 XFeO ¼ a lnƒO 2 þ b T þ c þ ΣdiXi , The occurrence of primitive hematite in closely association with magnetite strongly suggests a very high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 11 ) , such that reaching the HM oxygen fugacity buffer ( equivalent tõ ΔFMQ + 4 ) during porphyry Cu mineralization .
Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2− ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2− ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid immiscible phase separation .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .
The systems are closely related to underlying composite plutons , at paleodepths of 5 to 15 km , which represent the supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate ( > 3 km ) stocks or dike swarms and associated mineralization .
Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions , whereas car - bonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu - Au skarns , less common distal Zn - Pb skarns , and , beyond the skarn front , carbonate - replacement Cu and / or Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au deposits , and / or sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) Au deposits .

High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits , where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag - rich , disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so .
Low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite ± bornite assemblages are characteristic of potassic zones , whereas higher sulfidation - state sul - fides are generated progressively upward in concert with temperature decline and the concomitant greater degrees of hydrolytic alteration , culminating in pyrite ± enargite ± covellite in the shallow parts of the litho - caps .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may form during por - phyry intrusion , with some of them containing high mineralization because of their intrinsic permeabil - ity .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .

PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal base and precious metal mineralization .
PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes ( 10− > 100 km 3 ) of hydrothermally altered rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal base and precious metal mineralization .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .

Porphyry Cu systems show a marked tendency to occur in linear , typically orogen - parallel belts , which range from a few tens to hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long , as exemplified by the Andes of western South America ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Fig . 2 ) and the Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt of Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria ( Janković , 1977 ; Popov et al . , 2002 ) .
Strongly extensional settings , typified by compositionally bimodal basalt - rhyolite magmatism , lack significant porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1999a ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Arc - parallel alignments may occur along intra - arc fault zones , as exemplified by the Chuquicamata district , northern Chile ( Fig . 3b ) whereas cross - arc fault zones or lineaments control arc - transverse alignments , as in the Cadia , New South Wales ( Fig . 3c ) and Oyu Tolgoi , Mongolia districts ( Fig . 3d ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .
Mineralization elsewhere in porphyry Cu systems may be even more profoundly influenced by rock type .
Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small irregular bodies .
Diatreme breccias have a distinctive texture , in which widely separated , typically centimeter - sized clasts are dominated by rock - flour matrix containing an andesitic dacitic tuffaceous component ( Table 1 ) , the latter commonly difficult to recognize where alteration is intense .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , generally occupying steep , pipelike to irregular bodies , are commonly intermineral in timing as a result of being generated in close association with intermineral porphyry phases ( Figs . 6 , 8 ) .
The shape of any porphyry Cu orebody may undergo significant modification as a result of emplacement of late - to postmineral rock volumes ( e . g . , Fig . 5a ) , as exemplified by the low - grade cores caused by internal emplacement of latemineral porphyry phases ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Philippines ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) and , much less commonly , latestage diatremes ( e . g . , El Teniente ; Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Camus , 2003 ) .
Chloritic and propylitic alteration develop distally at shallow and deeper levels , respectively ( Fig . 10 ) .
Quartzalunite
Biotite is the predominant alteration mineral in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , whereas K - feldspar increases in abundance in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings .
Chlorite - sericite alteration ( Table 2 ) , giving rise to distinctive , pale - green rocks , is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , particularly Au - rich examples , where it overprints preexisting potassic assemblages ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits display single veinlet sequences that comply with the generalizations summarized above and ( Barr et al . , 1976 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2002 .
PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS in Figure 13 and Table 2 , but repetitions of group 1 and 2 veinlets , for example , early biotite , EDM halo , and A types cut by lesser numbers of later EDM halo and A types ( e . g . , Bingham ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ) , occur where time gaps between porphyry phases are sufficiently large ; however , group 2 and 3 veinlets are only uncommonly repeated .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .
Advanced argillic lithocaps
Metal zoning in porphyry Cu systems is well documented , particularly at the deeper , porphyry Cu levels ( e . g . , Jerome , 1966 ; Titley , 1993 ) .
The shallow - level steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious and base metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .
The parental chambers , tending to be localized at sites of neutral buoyancy ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) , are the sources of both magmas and hightemperature , high - pressure metalliferous fluids throughout system development .
Fluid inclusion microanalysis and experimental studies reveal that , during phase separation , specific element suites selectively fractionate between the vapor and hypersaline liquid .
The quartz - veined cores of potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions have crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .
High Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .
The Cordilleran massive sulfide lodes are localized where the liquid follows pronounced structural permeability sericitic to advanced argillic transition ( Figs . 6 , 10 ) or , less commonly , encounters reactive carbonate rocks ( e . g . , Baumgartner et al . , 2008 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts dike swarms overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .
Porous permeable volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequences also favor large - tonnage orebody development in the lithocap environment , especially where they happen to be shallowly located with respect to paleosurfaces .
porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
A quartz - pyrite assemblage replaces any carbonate rocks incorporated in advanced argillic lithocaps ( e . g . , Bisbee , Arizona ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .
The parental magmas need to be water rich ( > ~ 4 wt % ) and oxidized in order to maximize the metal contents of the resultant aqueous phase ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Candela , 1992 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration mineralization .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .
The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low ( e . g . , quartz sandstone , felsic igneous rocks ) rather than high ( mafic igneous rocks ) acid - buffering capacities .
Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .
The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .
The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage , nearly monomineralic veinlets .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery cristobalite , alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
The Cu ± Mo ± Au cores typically have kilometer - scale halos defined by anomalous Zn , Pb , and Ag values that reflect lower temperature , hydrothermal conditions ( Fig . 9a , b ) .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .
Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .
These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These Zn - Pb - Ag ± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As ± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
Such a decrease solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .
There , Cu ± Mo ± Au characterize the potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic cores of systems .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
The more structurally confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .
The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite illite / smectite .
( 7 ) if externally derived nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .
Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .
Commonly , the highest grade most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .
Generalized alteration - mineralization zoning pattern for telescoped porphyry Cu deposits , based on the geologic and deposit - type template presented as Figure 6 .
Any exposed A - type quartz veinlet stockworks overprinted by sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages immediately pinpoint the spots for initial scout drilling ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
Injection of fine - grained , igneous matrix defines the igneous breccia near the base of the body .
End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
Where intense chlorite - sericite or sericitic alteration overprints are developed , the reconstitution of potassic alteration may result in either reduction complete stripping of original metal contents .
In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .
However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .
However , the El Indio and Yanacocha high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga and Cajamarca - Huaraz belts , respectively .
Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .
In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries lithocaps .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
Many features of porphyry Cu systems at all scales need to be taken into account during planning and exe - cution of base and precious metal exploration programs in magmatic arc settings .
The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .
( 4 ) how is the single - phase magmatic liquid transferred from the parental magma chambers to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , and what distance can be travelled by this fluid between exiting the chambers and eventual phase separation ?
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma ceases , there are marked reductions in both the heat flux and aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H . SILLITOE 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 6 and 10 to show the evolution of the main magmatic fluid and alteration - mineralization types in concert with progressive downward magma solidification , cooling , and paleosurface degradation .
Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor of the same composition as it cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .
Emplacement of the porphyry stocks in many central Andean deposits took from 2 to 5 m . y . , implying that appreciable time ( 0 . 5−1 . 5 m . y . )
Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization at shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .
In contrast , large high - sulfidation epithermal deposits average 1 to 3 g / t Au but have only minor or no recoverable Cu , commonly as a result of supergene removal .
Note the absence of Cu - bearing sulfides from the early , high - temperature advanced argillic zone .
( 8 ) what controls metal depletion versus enrichment during chlorite - sericite overprints ?
In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( ± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
The Cu / Au ratios of lithocap - hosted , highsulfidation mineralization tend to decrease upward , with the result that most major high - sulfidation Au ( ± Ag ) deposits occur in the shallow parts of lithocaps , commonly - but not always - with their tops immediately below the former paleowater table positions ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration event ( s ) that affect the early and intermineral porphyries and their immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .
Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid neutralization , and cooling .
However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Anatomy of a telescoped porphyry Cu system showing spatial interrelationships of a centrally located porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposit in a multiphase porphyry stock and its immediate host rocks ; peripheral proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , and sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) deposits in a carbonate unit and subepithermal veins in noncarbonate rocks ; and overlying high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits in and alongside the lithocap environment .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous or siliciclastic wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .
The upward - escaping , low - pressure vapor that does not attain the paleosurface as high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Hedenquist , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993 ) forms acidic condensate to produce generally barren advanced argillic alteration .
Volumes of the different alteration types vary markedly from deposit to deposit .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
( 12 ) why do only a few lithocaps appear to develop intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits on their peripheries ?
In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au ± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .
At several localities , the advanced argillic alteration at the bottoms of lithocaps displays a characteristic patchy texture , commonly defined by amoeboid pyrophyllite patches embedded in silicified rock ( e . g . , Escondida and Yanacocha ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ) .
Simplified sections through high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits to illustrate the wide variation in alteration zoning patterns and their relationship to porphyry intrusions and Cu tenor .
The main development of these bornite - , chalcocite bearing , high - sulfidation assemblages is largely confined to white sericitic alteration that overprints now - barren quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The deeper , central cores of porphyry Cu systems are occupied by porphyry Cu deposits , in which ore - zone geometries depend mainly on the overall form of the host stock or dike complex , the depositional sites of the Cu - bearing sulfides , and the positions of any late , low - and subore - grade porphyry intrusions and diatremes .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au and , less commonly , distal Au and / or Zn - Pb skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .
A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) .

( 2003 ) .
This situation implies that the underlying parental plutons have protracted life spans , albeit intermittent in some cases , with porphyry Cu formation taking place above them at different places over time .
If this scenario is correct , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity ( 5−20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .
The A - type veinlets range from stockworks to subparallel , sheeted arrays , the latter particularly common in Au - rich porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size , grade , and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems .
They span a range of compositions from calc - alkaline diorite and quartz diorite through granodiorite to quartz monzonite ( monzogranite ) , and alkaline diorite through monzonite to , uncommonly , syenite ( e . g . , Galore Creek , British Columbia ; Enns et al . , 1995 ) .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper - saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .

The largest concentrations of peripheral Zn , Pb , and Ag are confined to systems hosted by receptive carbonate rocks , where fluid neutralization induces the precipitation skarn and carbonate - replacement deposits ( Seward and Barnes , 1997 ) .
This scenario implies episodic but focused magma and fluid ascent for as long as ~ 5 m . y .
Schematic crosscutting relationships between early ( immediately premineral ) , intermineral , and late - mineral porphyry phases in porphyry Cu stocks and their wall rocks .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich , Mopoor porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , exploration should focus first around their peripheries in case a porphyry Cu deposit has already been exposed .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias display a variety of textures ( Table 1 ) , which are mainly dependent on clast form and composition , clast / matrix ratio , matrix / cement constitution , and alteration type .
At first glance , using representative cross sections of alteration at four highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits as examples ( Fig . 15 ) , these varied geometries are not easy to relate to a standard geologic model .
The early , intermineral , and late - mineral phases of the porphyry Cu stocks , which span the interval during which the porphyry Cu deposits formed , originate from increasingly greater depths in the progressively crystallizing parental chamber .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite ± chalcocite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .
It is unlikely coincidental that at least half the ore at three of the highest grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits is hosted by such rocks : a gabbro - diabase - basalt complex at El Teniente ( Skewes et al . , 2002 ) , a Proterozoic diabase sill complex at Resolution , Arizona ( Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) , and a tholeiitic basalt sequence in the Oyu Tolgoi district .
Arranged from probable oldest ( top ) to youngest ( bottom ) , except for propylitic that is lateral equivalent of potassic ; advanced argillic also forms above potassic early in systems ( Fig . 10 ) 3 Many veinlets in potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alteration contain anhydrite , which also occurs as late , largely monomineralic veinlets particularly , advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2002 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ) .

middle Eocene to early Oligocene belt of northern Chile , because of the tendency for subsurface magma accumulation in the absence of widely developed extensional faulting ( Mpodozis and Ramos , 1990 ) .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .

Note that the high - grade ( > 1 . 5 % Cu ) zone at Chuquicamata includes a substantial , but unquantified , contribution from supergene enrichment .
Notwithstanding the typical occurrence model depicted in Figure 6 and taking into account the critical importance of erosion level , the innumerable variations on the porphyry Cu genetic theme result in a broad spectrum of three - dimensional intrusion , breccia , alteration , and mineralization geometries ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
Partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust and / or sediments may occur under some restricted conditions , but is unlikely to be a widespread process ( in Phanerozoic arcs ) , and does not significantly differ metallogenically from slab - dehydration processes .
Concentrations of chalcophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance of residual sulfide phases in the mantle source .
Gold rich porphyry deposits would only form where residual sulfide abundance was very low ( magma / sulfide ratio N 10 5 ) , perhaps due to unusually high mantle wedge oxidation states .
Partial melting of these subduction - modified sources due to post - subduction thermal readjustments or asthenospheric melt invasion will generate small volumes of calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline magmas , which may redissolve residual sulfides .

Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
sulfate , dissolved first in slab fluids and then magma ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ) .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .
Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .
Previously subduction - modified asthenosphere is unlikely to be a viable source except for a short period after subduction has ceased ( e . g . , Richards et al . , 1990 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , because such material will be quickly dispersed by mantle convection .
Crustal melting during post - collisional stress relaxation
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .
Post - subduction tectonic environments conducive to the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits by remobilization of previously subduction - modified lithosphere ( modified from Richards , 2009 ) .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .
Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Sparse sulfide phases in these arc cumulates , residual from fractionation of previous arc magmas , will likely be rich in chalcophile and highly siderophile elements .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 are high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 are high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
At R - factors below ~ 10 2 , magmas will be depleted in both Cu and Au .
In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .
The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Ti , Nb , and Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .
The oxidation state mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .
the Sn could have been extracted from the crustally - derived granites .
Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions arc magmatism , sulfur will be dominantly present as sulfate and sulfate , but saturation in small amounts of sulfide phases is also likely .
This lithosphere will have undergone significant modification during the previous subduction cycle , most importantly with the introduction of large volumes of hydrous , mafic ( amphibolitic ) cumulates residual from lower crustal differentiation arc basalts .
This process occurs most efficiently at depths greater than ~ 6 km , within large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes fed by arc or post - subduction magmas .
Most base and precious metals would be expected to have at least moderate solubilities in the hot , relatively oxidized , saline aqueous fluids exsolved from the downgoing slab .
Such sulfides would have retained significant amounts of the subduction flux of Cu and Mo , but HSE would be diluted to low concentrations by the greater volume sulfide ( low R - factor ; Fig . 2 ) .
These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .
These high sulfur contents have great significance for the behavior of chalcophile metals ( see Sections 2 . 1 . 1 , 2 . 5 . 1 , and 3 ) .
These volatiles drive buoyant , bubbly , evolved magma upwards into the cover rocks to form subvolcanic stocks and dikes , or explosive volcanic eruptions if they reach surface .
At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
Under lower f S2 post - subduction conditions ( a flux of S from the subduction zone is no longer present ) , any residual sulfide phases would likely dissolve into the S - undersaturated silicate melt , carrying their metal loads with them ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ) .
These high observed metal solubilities are consistent with or exceed experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on chloride complexing alone ( e . g . , Holland , 1984 , 1986 ) , and suggest that other volatile ligands such as sulfide species may enhance the solubility of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in high temperature aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz et al . , 2008Zajacz et al . , , 2011 .
Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .
Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .
Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions of the supra - subduction zone mantle wedge , the bulk of the sulfur flux will likely consist of SO 2 or 1 4 0 0 °C 1 4 0 0 °C 60 0 °C 1 0 0 0 °C E c l o g i t e Sediment Metasomatized asthenosphere Fig . 1 .
Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .
Finally , partial melting of predominantly reduced , sulfide - rich crustal rocks in orogenic settings may lead to chalcophile and siderophile element - depleted , but potentially lithophile element - rich S - type magmas ( see Section 2 . 6 ) .
Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .
Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .
Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .
Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .
argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
The ultimate metal inventory and metal ratios in any given porphyry or related deposit is secondarily controlled by late - stage magmatic and shallow crustal processes .
Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .
They include porphyry Mo deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .
Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .
He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .
Variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Blatter and Carmichael , 1998 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) will not greatly affect the potential to form synsubduction porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , but might control the Cu / HSE ratio in later magmas formed by post - subduction melting of these sulfide - bearing residues .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .
The relatively high oxidation state arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .
Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .
Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
In contrast , at intermediate abundances sulfide ( intermediate R - factor ) , only originally sparse HSE will show significant depletions .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
( For reviews of alkalic - type epithermal deposits , see Jensen andBarton , 2000 andRichards , 1995 ) .
( b - d ) During post - subduction tectonic processes , previously subduction - modified sub - continental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) or lower crustal hydrous cumulate zones residual from previous arc magmatism ( black layer ) may undergo small - volume partial melting .
In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .
In contrast , some porphyry Mo and all porphyry Sn - W deposits are associated with felsic granitoids , derived primarily from melting of continental crust during intra - plate rifting events .
Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Consequently , it is in collisional orogens such as the Neo - Tethyan belt southeastern Europe and southern Asia that some of the clearest examples of post - subduction magmatism and mineralization are found .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .
Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .
This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .
Depths are indicated for hydrostatic pressure conditions .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
The question of whether the downgoing oceanic slab , or more specifically the basaltic oceanic crust , melts during subduction has prompted lively debate recently , not only in the petrology literature ( e . g . , Conrey , 2002 ; Kepezhinskas , 2001 , 2002 ; Garrison and Davidson , 2003 ) , but also amongst economic geologists because of the suggestion that " slab melts " might in some way be uniquely fertile for later porphyry ore formation ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Oyarzun et al . , , 2002Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Thiéblemont et al . , 1997 ; for contrary opinions , see : Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition Cu and Mo ± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
Such common processes , affecting batches crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .
A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .
A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .
Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .
The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .
Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .
Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .
However , Dietrich et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested a possible role for mantle - derived magmas in triggering volatile ( and metal ) release from evolved , felsic magmas in the Bolivian tin belt , and Walshe et al . ( 2011 ) have identified a mantle Nd isotopic signature in tin granites from eastern Australia .
This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .
This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .
Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .
It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .
Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu original arc magmas .
Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .
Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .
