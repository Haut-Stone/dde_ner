Metallogenesis related tomes - and Neo - Tethyan evolution
The asthenosphere upwelling after the removal is an efficient mechanism to trigger the partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust .
The partial melting metasomatized lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust was responsible for the production of highly oxidized magma and corresponding formation of Cu - Au - Mo ore deposits upon the previous subduction zone .
The fault control on the mineralization is in conformity with the Ar - Ar isochron age ~ 27 Ma of phlogopite from the mineralized lamprophyre , which intruded at ~ 35 Ma , representing the main mineralization stage ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) .

Orebodies are predominantly banded quartz veins , which are strictly controlled by bedding faults .
Abundant Fe - Ti oxide ore deposits are associated with less evolved basaltic magma in the Emeishan large igneous province than elsewhere in the world and the difference is attributed to selective assimilation newly subducted , stagnant oceanic lithospheric slab by the ascending mantle plume - derived picritic magma that was originally undersaturated with Fe - Ti oxides ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .

The spreading of Meso - Tethyan Ocean separated the W . Qiangtang and Sibumasu blocks from late - Permian , and the closure of the main Paleo - Tethyan Ocean caused the amalgamation blocks as well as the earlier separated blocks ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) .
Later lithospheric thinning , usually caused by delamination , resulted in the generation granitoid magma characterized by varied and generally lower whole - rock Sr / Y ratios ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2015a ; .

The E - W - trending metallogenic belt , located in the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton ( Fig . 16 ) , hosts two major types of ore deposits : porphyry - skarn - stratabound Cu - Au - Mo - Fe deposits with an age range of 137 - 143 Ma and apatite - magnetite ( or magnetite porphyry ) deposits with ages of 125 - 123 Ma ( Mao et al . , 2006 , Mao et al . , 2011b .
The 40 Ar / 39 Ar plateau age for biotite from the potassic alteration in the Luoboling Cu - Mo deposit in the Zijinshan is 105 ± 2 Ma ( Zhang et al . , 2003b ) , which is the same as the Re - Os isochron age of 104 . 9 ± 1 . 6 Ma for molybdenite separates from the deposit ( Liang et al . , 2012 ) .
The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting of metasedimentary rocks in the overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The regional lithospheric extension may have been the driving force for generation and emplacement of the mafic / crust derived magmas , which induced partial melting of the overlying crustal materials to produce felsic magmas ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) .
The zircon εHf ( t ) values Dexing metallogenic granites suggests that the magma was derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust , formed through thickened lithospheric mantle delamination at ~ 160 Ma in an intracontinental setting Wang et al . , 2015b ) .

The superimposed orogeny is best exemplified by the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ) orogenic belts , which comprise blocks separated from Gondwana through the opening of Paleo - Neo - Tethyan oceans ( Fig . 5 ) .
The subduction main Paleo - Tethyan oceanic crust and those of its branches generated arc magmatism as well as S - type granitoids ( Figs . stage , after the lithosphere has been thickened , the lithospheric mantle was removed leading to the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism in the northern margin of Tibet and Sanjiang belts during 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2005 ; ) .
The metallogenic types in these two types of orogenesis are also different .
The remelting Neoproterozoic juvenile crust resulted in the metal - carrying magma , ( Fig . 19d ) and the metamorphism of juvenile crust during continental lithospheric subduction of Yangtze Craton and concomitant crustal shearing was deduced to release gold - rich metamorphic fluid ( Fig . 19c ) . Another important fact for the spatial preferences is the lithosphere structure vulnerable to tectonic reactivation and relatively high crust permeability .
The reactivation of ancient deep faults or syn - depositional faults formed in the previous tectonic regimes was favorable for the transportation fluids .
The analysis on the geochemical characteristics of ore - forming granitoids from the different tectonic units displayed that the superimposed orogeny exerted significant control on the source metallogenic granitoid and the associated metal species ( Figs . 6 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 and 17 ) . During the early orogenic phase of the superimposed orogenic system , mantle melt contributed to the formation of juvenile mafic lower crust , resulting in formation of Cudominant ore deposits .
The different sources and proportions of magma mixing yielded three potential sources that caused a large variation combinations .
The reactivation ancient sutures , craton margins and arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal , eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) . Precursor subduction - related magmatism is important because such processes leave ore - metal enriched residue in cumulate zones within the juvenile crust , which can be re - mobilized during later partial melting .

Earlier studies linked the Yanshanian volcanism in the Great Xing ' an Range with ages peaking at Ma ( Fig . 7 ) to the west - to - east migrating delamination processes and associated magmatic underplating ( e . g . , Wang et al . , 2006a ) .
In a few cases , different metallogenic processes mutual interference in one metallogenic belt under the same tectonic setting , called one - period composite metallogenic system .
This generally explains the evolution of felsic magma - related ore metal associations proceeding during the superimposed orogeny .
The meta - igneous rocks are enriched LREE and depleted in high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta and Ti , have geochemical signatures that are similar to those of arc volcanic rocks .
The geodynamic engine of the Jiaodong - type Au deposit is considered to be oceanic subduction coupled with lithospheric thinning ( Zhu et al . , 2015a with structural control in the shallow crust .
Later at ~ 32 to 27 Ma , the large - scale continental underthrust resulted in the release of regional metamorphic fluid , bringing gold out the juvenile crust and forming the orogenic Au deposits in the Ailaoshan shear system along the western margin of South China Block ( Fig . 19 ) .

The rollback of the subducted Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab caused the magmatism with ages from 55 to 45 Ma in the Gangdese arc belt in southern Tibet ( Chung et al . , 2005 ( Chung et al . , , 2009 .
The earlier to later phase of granites low K calc - alkaline series to high - K calc - alkaline and shoshonitic series , and the associated metal species changed from Cu - dominant to Mo - dominant .
It is thus concluded that the ancient lower crust has contributed Mo into the parental magma , and the involvement of mantle or juvenile crust melt induced complex metal associations and lowered A / CNK values .
50 ) formed at ~ 35 Ma in the western margin of the South China Block ( Fig . 14 ) , the most positive zircon εHf ( t ) values are concentrated at the hafnium evolution line of 0 . 9 Ga .
It has been suggested that the Sijiaying BIF formed in a back - arc or arc basin setting in Neoarchean .
There are various triggers for superimposed orogeny on the scale of global tectonics .
This is similar to those in the Beiya Au deposit ( No .
Recent research reveals that the Precambrian ore deposits were party subjected to secondary re - mobilization .
Geochemically , the granites are strongly peraluminous , with high contents of alkalis , belonging to highly fractionated S - type granites ( Fig . 17 ) .
160 Ma granitic porphyries in the Jiguanshan Mo deposit ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
The zircon εHf ( t ) values in the peraluminous granitoids associated with Mo mineralization from the southern margin the North China Craton are clustered around the evolution line of 2 . 0 Ga with a few plots scattered around 3 . 0 - 4 . 0 Ga ( Fig . 9 ) ( summarized in Supplementary File C ) .
For instance , at least four major metallogenic events Gangdese porphyry Cu belt Lhasa Block ( Fig . 12 ) .
It should be emphasized that in the granitoid - related intracontinental ore deposits sources , such as the Gejiu , Dexing , and Beiya , syn - mineralization mafic dikes are also associated , including diabase and lamprophyre , in both time and space .
It was therefore considered that the consecutive ocean opening and northward migration blocks from the Gondwana margins was driven by the previous oceanic subduction ( Deng et al . , 2015a ) .
The geochemical compositions with the Mo - carrying granitoid in the ore deposits Mujicun , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , show the metallogenic granitoid are high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic ( Fig . 9 ) .
The geochemical compositions with the Mo - carrying granitoid in the ore deposits , including Jinduicheng , Mujicun , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , show the metallogenic granitoid shoshonitic ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has been proposed that two pairs of Paleo - Tethyan sutures , the LongmuTso - Shuanghu and Changning - Menglian ( [ 17 ] ) and Jinshajiang and Ailaoshan ( [ 23 ] ) are developed with comparable magmatic and sedimentary records ( Deng et al . , 2014a ) .
Nanling and adjacent areas , forming a NE - trending cluster ( Fig . 16 ) .
Despite this , a large population of the εHf ( t ) values in Yulong cluster at the 0 . 9 - 1 . 0 Ga line .
The results suggest the lithosphere of the eastern North China Craton was subjected to more extensive thinning and destruction as compared with that in the central part ( Shen et al . , 2013b ) .
The former is largely found within several ore clusters at the intersections of NE - and EW - trending faults in southeastern Hubei , Jiurui , Anqing - Guichi , Tongling and Ningzheng provinces .
The ore deposits in this period include the BIF , VMS ore deposit ranging from Archean , late - Paleoproterozoic , to Neo - Proterozoic ( Fig . 8 ) .
These geochemical features indicate that the porphyry belongs to the adakite type , which was derived from a thickened crust with the presence of garnet .
Geochronological and geochemical features of the Jurassic ore - bearing porphyries in the 161 . 5 ± 2 . 7 Ma , consistent with the emplacement times of their host plutons .
Zircon grains of the ore - forming intrusions show highly negative εHf ( t ) values ranging from −18 to −26 and −20 to −35 and significantly old model ages ranging of 2 . 3 to 3 . 5 Ga . For other Mo deposits formed in late Cretaceous , like Jinduicheng , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , the co - magmatic zircons in the oreforming intrusions displays highly negative εHf ( t ) .

This is consistent with the development of several layers with high metal concentrations in the basins .
200 - 100 Ma granitoids in Xing ' an associated with Mo ( Cu ) deposits have zircon εHf ( t ) values between the hafnium isotopic evolution lines of 0 . 4 Ga and 1 . 5 Ga , and their Sr / Y ratios change from 100 to 0 . 1 .
64 ) formed at 1 . 166 ± 0 . 02Ma , according to the Ar - Ar plateau age hydrothermal sericite , in the eastern margin of the block .
It is reasonable to consider that the incorporation of mantle melt , besides the juvenile crust contribution , accounted for the shift in εHf ( t ) Yulong ore belt .

5 ) located at the southern margin of the Chinese Altai occurs in metamorphic acid volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of Devonian Kangbutiebao Formation and are faultcontrolled ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment during the previous subduction - and later collision - related magmatic events in the Lhasa block provide important insights into mineral potential .
Examples of the dominant types of superimposed orogeny in China include : ( 1 ) Cenozoic continental collision superimposed on Paleo - to Mesozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet and Sanjiang orogenic belts ; ( 2 ) Reactivation of Paleozoic accretionary orogen in later Mesozoic oceanic subduction in the eastern part of Qinling–Qilian–Kunlun and Central Asian orogenic belts ; ( 3 ) Mesozoic oceanic subduction under the paleo - suture in the South China Block ; ( 4 ) Mesozoic demantling along the Paleo - and Neoproterozoic , and Paleozoic sutures in the eastern part of North China Craton ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab .

Their old T DM C ages , peraluminous to metaluminous affinity , and the associated Cu - dominant mineralization , suggesting the crustal source were most likely composed of mafic juvenile crust originated from mantle , since the period of 2 . 85 Ga to 2 . 40 Ga was an important stage for crust growth via oceanic subduction in the craton .
2 ) contains > 500 million metric tons of sulfide ores with grades of 1 . 1 wt . % Ni and 0 . 7 wt . % Cu , and is the largest single magmatic Ni - Cu sulfide ore deposit in the world ( Li and Ripley , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) .
The metallogeny in this craton started from Precambrian and reached the climax in late Cretaceous with the formation of the Jiaodongtype gold deposits and porphyry Mo deposits .
From regional geology , lithologic association , and geochemical features of the associated meta - volcanics and orthogneisses , previous studies suggested that the highgrade BIF formed initially in arcs , which were intruded by voluminous tonalities and granodiorites , and later converted by deformation and high - grade metamorphism into orthogneisses .
Individual systems have life spans of ~ 100 , 000 to several mil - lion years , whereas deposit clusters or alignments as well as entire belts may remain active for 10 m . y .
Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions , whereas car - bonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu - Au skarns , less common distal Zn - Pb and / or Au skarns , and , beyond the skarn front , carbonate - replacement Cu and / or Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au deposits , and / or sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) Au deposits .
Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions , whereas car - bonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu - Au skarns , less common distal Zn - Pb and / or Au skarns , and , beyond the skarn front , carbonate - replacement Cu and / or Zn - Pb - Ag deposits , and / or sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) Au deposits .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits , where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag - rich disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so .
Low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite ± bornite assemblages are characteristic of potassic zones , whereas higher sulfidation - state sul - fides are generated progressively upward in concert with temperature decline and the concomitant greater degrees of hydrolytic alteration , culminating in pyrite ± enargite ± covellite in the shallow parts of the litho - caps .
Porphyry Cu systems are initiated by injection of oxidized magma saturated with S - and metal - rich , aqueous fluids from cupolas on the tops of the subjacent parental plutons .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .
PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes ( 10− > 100 km 3 ) of hydrothermally altered rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal base and precious metal mineralization .
The deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems may contain porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits of various sizes ( < 10 million metric tons [ Mt ] - 10 billion metric tons [ Gt ] ) as well as Cu , Au , and / or Zn skarns ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) , whereas their shallower parts may host high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal Au ± Ag ± Cu orebodies ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .
Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Quartzkaolinite
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10−12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .
Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S ± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
The quartz - veined cores potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .
High Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .
At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts porphyry Cu stocks overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .
Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing and bornite - free potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts of porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .
The Cu and , in places , Au contents of skarns are typically higher still .
The precursor pluton is multiphase , whereas the parental pluton is shown as a single body in which the concentric dotted lines mark its progressive inward consolidation .
The porphyry Cu - related intrusions comprise multiple phases ( Kirkham , 1971 ; Gustafson , 1978 ) , which were emplaced immediately before ( early porphyries ) , during ( intermineral porphyries ) , near the end of ( late mineral porphyries ) , and after ( postmineral porphyries ) the alteration and mineralization events ( Fig . 6 ) .
The porphyry intrusions contain variable amounts of phenocrysts , typically including hornblende and / or biotite , and fine - grained , commonly aplitic groundmass , resulting in open to crowded textures .
Many diatremes are late - stage additions to porphyry Cu systems , in which they commonly postdate and either cut or occur alongside porphyry Cu mineralization at depth ( Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Garwin , 2002 ) but overlap with high - sulfidation events at shallower epithermal levels ( e . g . , Dizon ; Fig . 6 ) .
The breccias are typically late - stage features and , hence , unaltered and barren .
The chalcopyrite ± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) , with one or more bornite - rich centers characterizing the deeper , central parts of many deposits .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .
The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low acid - buffering capacities .
Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .
The quartz veinlets commonly cut proximal prograde exoskarn ( Einaudi , 1982 ) but do not extend into the more distal carbonate rock - hosted ore types .
The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage veinlets .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery cristobalite , alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
The Cu ± Mo ± Au cores typically have kilometer - scale halos defined by anomalous Zn values that reflect lower temperature , hydrothermal conditions ( Fig . 9a , b ) .
The base and precious metal deposit types carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain minor volumes ( 5−10 % ) of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia ( Fig . 6 ) ; however , even major deposits can be either breccia free , as at Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , or breccia dominated , as exemplified by > 5 Gt of ore - grade breccia at Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Warnaars et al . , 1985 ; Serrano et al . , 1996 ; Fig . 5a ) .
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline or chalcedonic silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ºC ) of silica deposition .
Early porphyry Cu system evolution
In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu ± Au ± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration is centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
Such a decrease in solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In some bornite - rich centers , the sulfidation state is low enough to stabilize digenite ± chalcocite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Table 2 ) .
In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo tends to be concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .
Specific opaque mineral assemblages are intrinsic parts of each alteration type ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) because of the direct linkage between sulfidation state , the chief control on sulfide assemblages , and solution pH , a principal control of alteration type ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ; Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Fig . 12 ) .
The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .

This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems , including the overlying lithocaps .
Note that shallow alteration - mineralization types consistently overprint deeper ones .
Where the fluids F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .
Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal - or Au - bearing veins and mantos .
Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .
Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .
Elsewhere , small - volume porphyry intrusions and the associated magmatic fluids fail to effectively penetrate low - permeability rock packages , leading to the apparently uncommon development of blind , high - grade deposits , as at Hugo Dummett in the Oyu Tolgoi district ( Kirwin et al . , 2003 and Ridgeway in the Cadia district ( Wilson et al . , 2003 ) .
Much of the Mo in many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits occurs in the B - type veinlets , in marked contrast to the Cu dominance of the A - type generations , but D - type veinlets may also contain appreciable amounts of molybdenite in some deposits .
Any exposed A - type quartz veinlet stockworks overprinted by sericitic advanced argillic assemblages immediately pinpoint the spots for initial scout drilling ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
Injection of fine - grained matrix defines the igneous breccia near the base of the body .
In arcs where volcanic rocks are abundant , large - volume ignimbrites , indicative of caldera formation , are taken to seriously downgrade porphyry Cu and related epithermal Au potential for the reason given above .
However , the erosion involved in the unroofing of porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .
Limit of data Au - Ag
In contrast , Cu and Mo correlate less well , with spatial separation of the two metals commonly resulting from the different timing of their introduction ( e . g . , Los Pelambres ; Atkinson et al . , 1996 ) .
These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .
However , the El Indio and Yanacocha high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga belts , respectively .
For example , porphyry Cu prospects containing only weakly developed potassic alteration and A - type quartz veinlets in their central parts , indicating a deficiency of early - stage magmatic fluids , are typically subore grade .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .
Vuggy residual quartz / silicification Steam heated
Apart from the massive , commonly enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .
Nevertheless , resorption of any sulfide melt during ascent of oxidized magmatic fluids could make a major contribution to metal budgets ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ) .
The voluminous vapor readily separates from the coexisting hypersaline liquid and , because of its lower density , ascends buoyantly into the 1 - to 2 - km - thick rock column above the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Fig . 14 ) .
The sequence of alteration - mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling , from > 700° to < 250 °C , caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition .
On entering the lithocap environment , this intermediate sulfidation - state liquid ( forming chalcopyrite and tennantite at depth ) becomes unbuffered and easily evolves to a higher sulfidation state on cooling ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
The processes of subduction erosion and terrane accretion at convergent margins may assist with land - or trenchward migration of the arcs and contained porphyry Cu belts ( e . g . , von Huene and Scholl , 1991 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization types become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 12 ) , with the result that the shallower alteration - mineralization zones invariably overprint and at least partly reconstitute deeper ones .
Obviously , major skarn deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .
( 4 ) how is the single - phase magmatic liquid transferred from the parental magma chambers to porphyry Cu dike swarms , and what distance can be travelled by this fluid between exiting the chambers and eventual phase separation ?
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma convection ceases , there are marked reductions heat flux and aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H . SILLITOE 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 6 and 10 to show the evolution of the main magmatic fluid and alteration - mineralization types in concert with progressive downward magma solidification , cooling , and paleosurface degradation .
Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .
Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .
Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .
In contrast , large high - sulfidation epithermal deposits average 1 to 3 g / t Au but have only minor Cu , commonly as a result of supergene removal .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .
( 8 ) what controls metal depletion versus enrichment during chlorite - sericite and sericitic overprints ?
In addition , upward decompression and expansion of the vapor phase causes rapidly decreasing solubility of the vapor - transported metals ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ) , as confirmed by their very low contents in high - temperature but atmospheric - pressure fumaroles ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .

Exceptionally ferrous Fe - rich rocks , relatively uncommon in most arc terranes , also appear to assist with development of high hypogene Cu grades as well as maximizing the wall rock - hosted component of the deposit ( e . g . , El Teniente , Resolution , Oyu Tolgoi ) .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Anatomy of a telescoped porphyry Cu system showing spatial interrelationships of a centrally located porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposit in a multiphase porphyry stock and its immediate host rocks ; peripheral proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , and sediment - hosted deposits in a carbonate unit and subepithermal veins in noncarbonate rocks ; and overlying high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits in and alongside the lithocap environment .
Locally , however , the intermediate - sulfidation and both Cor dilleran lode and shallow , disseminated high - sulfidation mineralization types display transitional mineralogic relationships , as exemplified by the so - called Main Stage veins at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) and the disseminated A and Link Au zones at Wafi - Golpu ( Leach , 1999 ; Ryan and Vigar , 1999 )
The upward - escaping , low - pressure vapor that does not attain the paleosurface as high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Hedenquist , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993 ) forms acidic condensate to produce generally barren advanced argillic alteration .
In such situations , the advanced argillic alteration may be 1 to > 2 m . y .
Assessment of the likely host - rock lithologic units is also important during initial appraisals of porphyry Cu belts and districts .
It may be speculated that crustal compression aids development of large mid - to upper - crustal magma chambers ( Takada , 1994 ) capable of efficient fractionation and magmatic fluid generation and release , especially at times of rapid uplift and erosional unroofing ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) , events which may presage initiation of stress relaxation ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
The abovecited examples of mineralogic transitions between high - and intermediate - sulfidation mineralization provide support for this mechanism .
Irrespective of whether the Cu - bearing sulfide minerals are coprecipitated with veinlet quartz or , as generally seems to be the case , introduced paragenetically later ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2001Redmond et al . , , 2004 , a particularly strong correlation exists between quartz veinlet intensity and metal content in many porphyry Cu deposits , particularly in Au - rich examples ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
The immediately premineral , early porphyries and their contiguous host rocks contain the highest grade mineralization in most deposits although , exceptionally , the earliest phase can be poorly mineralized ( e . g . , Grasberg ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ) .
The main development of these bornite - , chalcocite - , and covellite bearing , high - sulfidation assemblages is largely confined to white sericitic alteration that overprints now - barren quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The deeper , central cores of porphyry Cu systems are occupied by porphyry Cu deposits , in which ore - zone geometries depend mainly on the overall form of the host stock or dike complex , the depositional sites of the Cu - bearing sulfides , and the positions of any late , low - and subore - grade porphyry diatremes .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .
A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) .

( 2003 ) .
Light stable isotope studies of sodic - calcic alteration in the Yerington district support the involvement of externally derived brine from the host sedimentary sequence , although the albite - actinolite alteration there is magnetite destructive ( Carten , 1986 ; .
If this scenario is correct , a single - phase 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .
There is a strong suggestion that comagmatic volcanism may be inhibited in some major porphyry Cu belts as a result of their characteristic contractional tectonic settings , as in the FIG .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Where steeply dipping , receptive carbonate rock sequences abut steep porphyry stock contacts , vertically extensive proximal skarn bodies may form ( e . g . , the > 1 , 600 - m extent of the Ertsberg East ( Gunung Bijih ) Cu - Au deposit , Indonesia ; Coutts et al . , 1999 ) .
The clustering or alignment of both porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits has been shown time and again to be a highly effective exploration concept .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , skarn Cu ± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts with less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high temperature liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper - saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .

Varied relationships are observed between porphyry Cu systems and precursor plutons , which are typically multiphase , equigranular intrusions , commonly of batholithic dimensions and dioritic to granitic compositions ; they are not only spatially , but also temporally and probably genetically related to porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au formation ( Fig . 4 ) .
Current orthodoxy maintains that the early sodic - calcic alteration observed in some porphyry Cu deposits is a product of inflowing brine sourced from host - rock sequences ( Carten , 1986 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005Seedorff et al . , , 2008 , in keeping with theoretical predictions for fluids following heating paths under silicate - rock−buffered conditions ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1984Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Schematic crosscutting relationships between early ( immediately premineral ) intermineral late - mineral porphyry phases in porphyry Cu stocks and their wall rocks .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles are dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Therefore recognition of A - and B - type veinlets in sericitic or advanced argillic zones testifies unambiguously to the former presence of potassic alteration .
Note the common absence of B - and D - type veinlets from Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks and M - , magnetite - bearing A - , and chlorite - rich veinlets from Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Field observations and theoretical calculations suggest that parental chambers with volumes on the order of 50 km 3 may be capable of liberating enough fluid to form porphyry Cu deposits , but chambers at least an order of magnitude larger are needed to produce giant systems , particularly where deposit clusters or alignments exist ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Nevertheless , several temporally discrete porphyry Cu - bearing arcs may be superimposed on PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS 5 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 A preeminent example of spatial and temporal coincidence between a porphyry Cu belt and an intra - arc fault zone : the northern Chile part of the central Andean middle Eocene to early Oligocene porphyry Cu belt and Domeyko fault system ( summarized from Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large , high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; Perelló et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Perelló , 2006 ) .
Schematic representation of generalized alteration - mineralization sequence in porphyry Cu systems paleodepth and system life span .
Only in the last decade or so , however , have the physicochemical connections with the high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal environment within and around overlying lithocaps been clarified ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2001 .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .
However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .
Copper , Mo and Au act as incompatible elements in sulfide undersaturated magmas , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .
Sulfate reduction and ferrous Fe oxidation form H + , which dramatically lowers the pH values of ore - forming fluids and causes pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .
Porphyry Cu and Au deposits almost do have systematically higher FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
Hematite is also found in fluid inclusions in Dexing ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) .
Anhydrite is a popular mineral identified in most veins ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
Porphyry Mo deposits generally have higher SiO 2 and lower FeO contents .
High zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios indicate very high oxygen fugacity , comparable to those of Chuquicamata ( Fig . 12 ) .
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Slab melts formed at ΔFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .
Sulfate reduction in hydrothermal fluids lowers pH and consequently elevates the oxygen fugacity of the system up to the HM buffer .
Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Oxidized Mt Washington adakite was emplaced at 41 - 35 . 3 Ma during the subduction of the west limb of the ridge , bringing more ore forming fluids into the Catface porphyry .
Oxidized adakitic ( slab melts ) rocks are overwhelmingly the most favorable candidates for porphyry mineralizations .
magnetite hematite and sulfates , found in the subduction released fluids of ultrahigh pressure quartz veins , which may elevate the oxygen fugacity of the mantle wedge ( X . M .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent by processes degassing , etc ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 .
Fluid extraction , however , is different from degassing , and thus Se provides no constraints on the process .
Crystallization of sulfide cannot explain this phenomenon , because Ni and Pt are even more chalcophile than Cu , with partition coefficients between sulfide and silicate melts of several hundreds and more than 20 thousand , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Sulfides formed through sulfate reduction are released into magmatic fluids , where they scavenge chalcophile elements Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Partial melting thickened eclogitic lower continental crust ( Wang et al . , 2006a ( Wang et al . , , b , 2007aZhang et al . , 2001a ) and fractional crystallization of garnet ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) or amphibole ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) may also form high Sr / Y magmas .
Adakite formation through slab melting , on the other hand , does favor porphyry Cu mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) .
Adakites are often generated by flat subduction of young oceanic crust with associated compressional stress in the upper plate .
Partial melting mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Geochemical signatures ridge subduction are important exploration targets for large porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration is mainly controlled by pH values ore - forming fluids ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Dominant mineral changes from biotite in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , to K feldspar in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration produces pale - green rocks and is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , overprinting preexisting potassic assemblages .
Sericitic alteration in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints the potassic sericite assemblages .
Metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require reduction of sulfate to sulfide during the final stage mineralization .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Degassing of SO 2 is not likely to be a main process for porphyry deposit formation , and it doesn ' t reduce sulfate to sulfide , either .
, slab melts high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios ( Mungall , 2002 ) , as well as other oxidized components , e . g . , carbonates , or other oxidized sediments .
At oxygen fugacities below ΔFMQ + 1 , 10 % or less partial melting mantle wedge allows preservation of residual sulfides , assuming that the S abundances in the mantle wedge is also 250 ppm .
In magma system , this is better described as oxidation of FeO by sulfate or another oxidant ( Eq .
The reduced diorite magma may have no relation with the porphyry mineralization , except to act as a host rock .
The reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either simply distal host rocks located as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry buried underneath , or originally oxidized magmas that were reduced through assimilation of reducing components .
The lack of Re in these sulfides can be plausibly interpreted by the high oxygen fugacity , under which most of the Re Re 6 + , and thus behaves as lithophile rather than chalcophile elements .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in melts is present as sulfate , such that the solubility of sulfur increases from 1300 ppm to 2 wt . % .
The reduction sulfate and oxidation of ferrous Fe lower the pH value .
The highly oxidized nature of porphyry magmas have been reported in essentially all types of porphyries ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ; , including porphyry Cu and Cu - Au deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , porphyry Au deposits , to porphyry Cu - Mo deposits ( Cuadra and Rojas , 2001 ; Lynch and Ortega , 1997 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) and pure porphyry Fig . 6 .
The Santo Tomas II ( Philex ) porphyry deposit , Philippines , has total reserves of 1 . 2 Mt Cu @ 0 . 33 wt . % and 233 t Au @ 0 . 64 g / t ( Table 1 ) .
The Cu - Au and Mo mineralizations that occur in the same ore bodies usually do not happen at the same time , indicating different sources and / or different mineralization processes .
The Dexing porphyry Cu deposit is located in southeastern China , with total reserves of 8 . 4 Mt Cu @ 0 . 45 % , 0 . 29 Mt Mo @ 0 . 01 % and 19 t Au @ 0 . 18 g / t ( Table 1 .
The Qulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit is now the largest porphyry - type deposit in China , with reserves of 10 . 4 Mt Cu @ 0 . 5 % and 0 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 03 % ( Table 1 .
The ore - forming magmas in this section of the Tethys margin have high Sr contents ( N 500 ppm ) and Sr / Y ( N 50 ) ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) , which are clearly adakitic ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) .
The sulfur content sulfide saturation ( SCSS ) increases solely as a function of increasing fO 2 ( Jugo , 2009 ) : SCSS ¼ S 2 - h i 1 þ exp 2 : 23ΔFMQ - 2 : 89 ð Þ ð Þ ð9Þ and ΔFMQ C ¼ 1 : 29 þ 0 : 45 ln S 6þ h i - ln S 2 - h ið10Þ where ΔFMQ C refers to the critical fO 2 for simultaneous saturation of sulfide and sulfate ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
The reduction Au during magma evolution is well - known in arc magmas ( Moss et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Togashi and Terashima , 1997 ) , and has been referred to as the magnetite crisis .
The oxidation potential of the SO 4 2− - S 3 − reaction also rises with decreasing pH ( Fig . 11 ) , so that magnetite may be further oxidized to hematite by SO 4 2 − , releasing OH − ( Eq .
The assimilation model , however , does not contradict with a deep mantle source for the S , Pb , nor Cu .
The total iron ( expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) content ranges from 2 . 25 wt . % to 5 . 53 wt . % for the Catface porphyry .
The mineralization Catface porphyry ( 40 . 4 - 41 Ma ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) are both within the age range of the Mt Washington adakite .
The mantle derived parent magmas of the Catface porphyry are expected to have been more reduced ( near the FMQ oxygen fugacity buffer ) and drier than the adakite , and to have a lower initial Cu contents .
Most Cu porphyry deposits form at depths of 2 - 4 km , and are usually associated with epithermal deposits at shallow depths if not removed by erosion ( Figs . 22d , 23a , b ) ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The sulfide phase contains high Au and Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements , such as Ni , Re , and Pt .
Most porphyry Cu deposits are associated with adakites Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012aSun et al . , , b , 2013aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , but the association is not true vice versa .
The alteration is characterized by transformation mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The alteration is characterized by transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite sericite potassic assemblages .
The solubility sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
This deposit is related to the closure of a small backarc basin Indonesia and the South China Sea .
HDP = hornblende diorite porphyry ; GDP = Granodiorite porphyry ; D = diorite .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma S - and metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Other porphyry deposits in the Climax - Henderson belt also contain hematite , indicating these deposits reached the HM buffer .
During metamorphism of the subducting slab , S is mobile from metamorphic rocks ranging in grade from blueschist to amphibolite ( Sun et al . , 2013a ; Tomkins , 2010 ) , such that they can release S and chalcophile elements to the mantle wedge ( J . L .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Another poly - metal deposit , Yinshan , formed roughly at the same time and may be paragenetically related ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) .
All the sulfate reduction reactions provide S 2 − , which promotes mineralization , forming chalcopyrite ( Eq .
How does porphyry remain oxidized after collecting sulﬁde from the pre - enriched sulﬁde accumulates ?
Abundant magnetite and hematite suggest that the ore - bearing porphyries are highly oxidized , reaching the HM buffer ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Indeed , magnetite crystallization / alteration is often taken as the controlling process for porphyry Cu mineralization by causing sulfate reduction and presumably also oxygen fugacity fluctuations ( Liang et al . , 2009 ) .
Based on H - O and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it has been argued that the methane - rich ore - forming fluids were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from penetrated sediments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
Instead , water is the most impor - tant factor that controls porphyry mineralization ( Richards , 2011a ) .
Similar to Catface , there are also adakites in Baogutu .
In fact , adakites associated with porphyry Cu deposits are mostly intermediate in composition , not felsic .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Moreover , degassing of any type is not likely to be a key process during porphyry mineralization , which is usually occurring at depths of 2 - 4 km ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
( 25 ) ) , releasing H + , which lowers pH and promotes further oxidation of ferrous Fe .
Many large porphyry Cu Au deposits are connected to subduction of spreading and aseismic ridges ( Fig . 27 ) ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Some of the reduced porphyries were originally associated with oxidized magmas but were reduced through assimilation of reducing components during emplacement .
Meanwhile , sulﬁde is kept undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized magmas , such that no sulﬁde segregation is expected ( Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Most of the porphyry deposits , however , reach the HM buffer value during mineralization .
Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .
Therefore , the crystallization of magnetite and hematite tends to lower the proportions of ferric iron in the magma , which apparently would lower the oxygen fugacity .
Meanwhile , Cu may be transported to distal sites through normal fluids .
Most of the C in magma occurs as CO 2 , therefore the oxygen buffer changes from graphite equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria as the magma ascends ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .
Mainly , the sulfur speciation in magmas is controlled by oxygen fugacity .
Although the tonnages of these reduced porphyry deposits are generally much smaller than oxidized porphyry deposits , the mechanism that controls these mineralization process needs to be clarified .
For example , graphite and diamond are stable in the deep mantle .
Therefore , ΔFMQ + 2 is often considered the magic number for porphyry mineralization .
For example , Cenozoic porphyry deposits located in island arcs in the southwestern Pacific are all Cu - Au deposits , e . g . , Grasberg and Batu Hijau in Indonesia ; Panguna and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea ; Lepanto - Far South East , Tampakan , Atlas and Sipilay in the Philippines ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast , sulfate reduction in magmas does not change the pH , such that the oxygen fugacity is slightly reduced .
In addition , degassing cannot explain the decoupling between δD and O isotope compositions .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .
In addition , compression also results in uplifting and erosions , which are later favorable for the exposure of porphyry deposits .
For example , sericitic advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
In addition to sulfate hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .
Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
Accompanying the oblique subduction ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional tectonic settings .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .
( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin - Mariana , and other arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .
Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .
The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea floor alteration .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature of the magmas .
It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .
Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ΔFMQ − 1 and 1500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ΔFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
What is the genetic link between high oxygen fugacity magmas and porphyry deposits ?
We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
Several different explanations for the fertility of adakitic slab melts have been proposed : Oxidized .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( ± Au and ± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher ε Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
( 11 ) ) to the right , which leads to the oxidation sulfide .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .
In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low pressure degassing .
This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .
Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .
This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
Basic principles of isotope geochemistry dictate instead that in degassing , i . e . , evaporating , the remaining liquid becomes isotopically heavier H and O .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .
The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .
C þ 2Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 4FeO þ CO 2ð28Þ Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .
6SO 2− 4 þ 5H 2 O þ 57FeO ¼ 2S − 3 þ 19Fe 3 O 4 þ 10OH −ð26Þ 2S − 3 þ 5H 2 O þ 15FeO ¼ 6S 2− þ 5Fe 3 O 4 þ 10H þð27Þ For large porphyry deposits , the reduction of sulfate inevitably results in the oxidation of magnetite to hematite as the pH lowered ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust and / or sediments may occur under some restricted conditions , but is unlikely to be a widespread process ( in Phanerozoic arcs ) , and does not significantly differ metallogenically from slab - dehydration processes .
Concentrations of chalcophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance of residual sulfide phases in the mantle source .
Gold rich porphyry deposits would only form where residual sulfide abundance was very low ( magma / sulfide ratio N 10 5 ) , perhaps due to unusually high mantle wedge oxidation states .
Partial melting of these subduction - modified sources due to post - subduction thermal readjustments or asthenospheric melt invasion will generate small volumes of calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline magmas , which may redissolve residual sulfides .

Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
sulfate , dissolved first in slab fluids and then magma ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ) .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .
Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .
Previously subduction - modified asthenosphere is unlikely to be a viable source except for a short period after subduction has ceased ( e . g . , Richards et al . , 1990 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , because such material will be quickly dispersed by mantle convection .
Crustal melting during post - collisional stress relaxation
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .
Post - subduction tectonic environments conducive to the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits by remobilization of previously subduction - modified lithosphere ( modified from Richards , 2009 ) .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .
Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .
Porphyry Mo and Sn - W deposits associated with felsic magmas in continental interiors are thought to form mainly by partial melting of continental crust during rifting to form S - type , lithophile element - rich granitic magmas .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .
At Rfactors N10 5 , magmas will be undepleted in Au and Cu ( porphyry Cu - Au - potential magmas ) .
The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .
Such magmas may remobilize Au as well as Cu ± Mo left behind in residual sulfide phases by arc magmatism , leading to the potential formation of porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo and alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits .
) , low temperature liquids , with evidence for decompressional boiling or fluid mixing as the prime ore depositional mechanism in high grade breccias and veins ( Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Richards , 1995 ) .
This lithosphere will have undergone significant modification during the previous subduction cycle , most importantly with the introduction of large volumes of hydrous mafic cumulates residual from lower crustal differentiation of arc basalts .
Such magmas have the potential to form Au - rich as well as normal Cu ± Mo porphyry and epithermal Au systems , depending on the amounts of sulfide present in the lower crustal source .
Most base and precious metals would be expected to have at least moderate solubilities in the hot , relatively oxidized , saline aqueous fluids exsolved from the downgoing slab .
Such sulfides would have retained significant amounts of the subduction flux Cu and Mo , but HSE would be diluted to low concentrations by the greater volume of sulfide ( low R - factor ; Fig . 2 ) .
These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .
These fluid - mobile components are also characteristically enriched in arc magmas ( e . g . , typical ranges of : 1 - 3 wt . % H 2 O , 500 - 2000 ppm Cl , 900 - 2500 ppm S ; Davidson , 1996 ; Gill , 1981 ; Noll et al . , 1996 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) , which is taken as evidence of aqueous fluid metasomatism of the mantle wedge magma source .
These volatiles drive buoyant magma upwards into the cover rocks to form subvolcanic stocks and dikes , or explosive volcanic eruptions if they reach surface .
At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .

These granites tend to be enriched in lithophile rather than chalcophile elements , reflecting their crustal origins , and may generate magmatic - hydrothermal deposits containing Sn , W , U , Mo , REE , Li , Be , B , and F .
Thus , mineralization may only occur where later moderate salinity liquids have followed a higher pressure , rather specialized cooling path , as described above ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ) .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .
In more oxidized magmas , although sulfide saturation likely occurs at some point during their evolution ( as indicated by the common presence of sparse sulfide inclusions in phenocrysts in arc volcanic rocks as well as lower crustal arc cumulates ; e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ; Halter et al . , 2002 ; Hattori , 1997 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Fig . 5 ) , it may not occur to the extent that sulfides physically separate from the magma , or at least not in large amounts .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .
In post - subduction tectonic settings Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting , a subducting slab source no longer exists , and magmas are predominantly derived from partial melting of the upper plate lithosphere .
Under the high f S2 conditions of the supra - subduction zone mantle wedge , the bulk of the sulfur flux will likely consist of SO 2 or 1 4 0 0 °C 1 4 0 0 °C 60 0 °C 1 0 0 0 °C E c l o g i t e Sediment Metasomatized asthenosphere Fig . 1 .
Finally , partial melting of predominantly reduced , sulfide - rich crustal rocks in orogenic settings may lead to chalcophile and siderophile element - depleted , but potentially lithophile element - rich S - type magmas ( see Section 2 . 6 ) .
Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .
Once these hybrid magmas andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .
Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .
Sources of metals
Behavior of metals
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .
Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .
Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .
In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .
Variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Blatter and Carmichael , 1998 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) will not greatly affect the potential to form synsubduction porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , but might control the Cu / HSE ratio in later magmas formed by post - subduction melting of these sulfide - bearing residues .
Metals such as Cu , Mo , Au , Sn , and W in porphyry and related epithermal mineral deposits are derived predominantly from the associated magmas , via magmatic - hydrothermal fluids exsolved upon emplacement into the mid - to upper crust .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry deposits .
The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .
Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .
Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .
Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .
( b - d ) During post - subduction tectonic processes , previously subduction - modified sub - continental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) or lower crustal hydrous cumulate zones residual from previous arc magmatism ( black layer ) may undergo small - volume partial melting .
Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .
Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
On the other hand , fluid focusing controls the lateral extent of mineralization .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
With the exception of porphyry Sn - W deposits that are associated with crustally derived S - type granites , most other deposits in this grouping are formed by calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline I - type granitoids directly or indirectly related to subduction .
Consequently , it is in collisional orogens such as the Neo - Tethyan belt southern Asia that some of the clearest examples of post - subduction magmatism and mineralization are found .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .
Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .
The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .
The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .
Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .
A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .
A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .
( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .
A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .
In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .
However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .
Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .
Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .
Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed a similar model for giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposits in the southwestern USA .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .
Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .
Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .
However , Dietrich et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested a possible role for mantle - derived magmas in triggering volatile ( and metal ) release from evolved , felsic magmas in the Bolivian tin belt , and Walshe et al . ( 2011 ) have identified a mantle Nd isotopic signature in tin granites from eastern Australia .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .
The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .
It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .
Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of arc andesite .
Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .
