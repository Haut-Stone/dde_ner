The giant Jiama deposit is only 2 km from the nearest outcrop of Jurassic volcanic succes - sions ( Fig . 1B ) .
The Jurassic PCDs occur only in the western segment of the Jurassic arc , which has depleted mantle - like isotopic compositions [ e . g . , ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i = 0 . 7041 - 0 . 7048 ; e Nd ( t ) as high as 7 . 5 , and e Hf ( t ) as high as 18 ] .
Their zircon Hf isotopic as doi : 10 . 1130 / G36362 . 1 Geology , published online on 5 February 2015 compositions plot within the inferred evolution trend of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA on plot of e Hf ( t ) versus age ( Fig . 2B ) .
Importantly , the coeval Miocene porphyry intrusions emplaced outside of the Jurassic arc are all barren ( Fig . 1B ) .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
In addition , the Miocene Cu - Morelated porphyries have higher Sr / Y ratios ( 23 - 186 ) and higher ( La / Yb ) N ratios ( 11 - 47 ) than the Jurassic rocks , showing geochemical affinity with adakite ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
This suggests that the arc segment barren for subduction - related PCDs could be fertile for collision - related PCDs .
Numerous 184 - 158 Ma granitoids and associated Jurassic volcanic rocks form a 600 - kmlong Jurassic arc ( JA ) ( Geng et al . , 2005 ) , onto which a > 1000 - km - long Cretaceous arc was subsequently superimposed ( Fig . 1 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
Copper contents of primary magmas are controlled by the oxidation state of their source , which determines the stability of residual sulphide phases , the main host of Cu ( refs 8 , 11 ) : higher oxidation states in the source result in higher Cu contents of the primary magma 8 .
Magmatic fO 2 play a prominent role in the development of tholeiitic versus calc - alkaline trends [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 18 : high water contents and fO 2 lead to calc - alkaline trends through suppression of plagioclase fractionation and promotion of early magnetite and amphibole fractionation 4 , 6 .
Arc magmas evolving in thinner crust are systematically enriched in Cu at intermediate MgO contents because of retarded magnetite crystallization , which also produces a tholeiitic trend therein ( Fig . 1c , d ) .
Trends of Cu MgO contents of bulk rocks differ depending on arc thickness ( Fig . 1 ) .
As a result , water contents of magmas evolving at higher depth increase rapidly to high values 20 , even at relatively high MgO in the residual melt 17 , because water is incompatible and more soluble at higher pressure .
The formation of calc - alkaline magmas is favoured by high water content and oxygen fugacity 4 - 7 .
Figure 2b shows that the thicker arc crust the more calc - alkaline ( less Fe 2 O 3tot - enriched at MgO ∼4 - 6 wt % ) are magmas ( see also refs 16 , 17 ) .
The inverse correlation between tholeiitic character ( Fe 2 O 3tot enrichment at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO ) and arc thickness ( Fig . 2b ) suggests that magmas evolving in thicker arcs are richer in H 2 O and more oxidized than those evolving in thinner arcs .
The global scale correlations among arc crustal thickness , Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot have important implications for the understanding of firstorder factors controlling the development of calc - alkaline versus tholeiitic trends and Cu depletion in arc magmas .
8 ) , recent studies 14 , 15 suggest that the oxidation state the subarc mantle is not significantly different from that of the mantle under ocean ridges and that Cu contents of the primitive magmas generated in these two contexts are similar 11 .
Nonetheless , as shown by the heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of porphyry - type deposits also within thick arcs 12 , only a special combination of regional to local scale conditions 28 will ultimately allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems within the generally favourable environment of thick arcs .
Porphyry copper deposits in Iran mainly coincide with the Cenozoic Urumieh–Dokhtar magmatic arc ( UDMA ; Fig . 1 ) , which was formed during subduction of the Neo - Tethyan oceanic crust beneath the Central Iranian plate ( Niazi and Asoudeh , 1978 ; Berberian and King , 1981 ; Pourhosseini , 1981 ) .
Magmatism and mineralization at Kighal shares many common features with the typical PCDs worldwide , including its volcanic arc tectonic setting , intrusion of calc - alkaline quartz monzonitic stock , development of typical zonal hydrothermal alteration assemblages ( potassic to advanced argillic ) , presence of widespread stockwork - type cross - cutting veinlets , occurrence of mineralization zoning with Cu–Mo - rich ore within the stock and Cu–Pb–Zn mineralization in the marginal parts , intrusion of various cross - cutting unmineralized dike series of intermediate composition , and high pyrite to chalcopyrite ratios and sulfur content of hydrothermal fluids ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Guilbert and Park , 1986 ; Sillitoe , 2000 , 2010 ; Richards et al . , 2012 ; Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ) .
The Cadomian orogeny is a well - documented period of enhanced crustal growth ( Pereira et al . , 2011 ) during which juvenile arc magmas interacted with reworked Archean crust to generate Ediacaran - Cambrian igneous rocks .
Such wide ranges of salinities and homogenization temperatures were also reported by many workers from typical PCDs throughout the world ( e . g . , Etminan , 1978 ; Wilkinson , 2001 ; Gonzalez - Partida and Levresse , 2003 ; Calagari , 2004b ) .
Further petrographic and microthermometric evidence such as the occurrence of two - phase and multiphase inclusions homogenizing over the same temperature range , as well as systematic distribution of the densities of liquid - and vapor - rich two - phase inclusions testify to the occurrence of liquid - vapor immiscibility ( boiling ) and separation of a high - salinity liquid phase from a low - salinity vapor - rich phase .
However , exhumation combined with erosion swept off much of these zones at Kighal and moreover , concluding based on the mineralogical observations , it can be said that due to relatively low abundance of pyrite and Cu - sulfides in the hypogene mineralization , the descending supergene fluids had low acidity and lower capacity and availability for leaching Cu from the oxidized zone .
In general , TDM ages represent a minimum age for the source material of the host magma from which the zircon crystallized .
It represents a calc - alkaline intrusion that was formed in a post - collisional continental margin setting , similar to the neighboring well - known Sungun porphyry copper deposit located 10 km further north .
In other words , such model ages indicate the crustal residence time for the rocks that hosted the zircon ( Matteini et al . , 2010 ) .
Following the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids and changes in their physico - chemical characteristics ( discussed in the next section ) , phyllic alteration zones were developed in the Kighal porphyry system .
While almost all of the discrete intrusive pulses and mineralization in southern Armenia have been dated and used to reconstruct the geodynamic setting and evolution of the region ( e . g . , Mederer et al . , 2013 , 2014 ; Moritz et al . , 2016 a , b ; Rezeau et al . , 2016 ) , such studies ( especially Hf isotope data ) are few for the intrusive bodies in NW Iran .
Secondly , this contribution provides zircon U–Pb and Hf isotope data in order to expand the existing database for the magmatism ( especially ore - related ) in NW Iran and along the UDMA , which can serve for better understanding and constraining the magmatic epochs and geodynamic evolution of the region , as part of the Alpine–Himalayan orogenic belt .
But after further cooling ( < 400C ) of SO2 - bearing hydrothermal fluids , hydrolysis caused the conversion of SO2 species into H2S and H2SO4 , which brought about the precipitation of sulfide and sulfate minerals in the Kighal porphyry system .
All these age data along the whole region of SAB , NW Iran and UDMA testify to the long - lived and pulsed nature of magmatism in these areas , which has migrated towards the southeast , corresponding to the later - stage closure of the Neo - Tethyan oceanic basin in this part ( e . g . , Agard et al . , 2011 ) .
Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) stated that the majority of porphyry copper deposits , which contain magnetite , either without sulfides or as part of ore - grade assemblages of bornite and / or chalcopyrite , as well as those with the dominance of pyrite + chalcopyrite in the ore zone , are of intermediate sulfidation state .
The late stage is barren , characterized by the formation of late quartz , calcite veinlets , along with minor amounts of sulfide minerals , though pyrite is still the dominant sulfide phase .
Another controversial case regarding this old to young trend is the Dalli porphyry Cu–Au deposit in central Iran .
Three distinct and separate populations of fluid inclusions were recognized in the salinity vs . TH ( L - V ) plot ( Simmonds et al . , 2015 ) : high salinity ( halite - bearing ) with wide range of TH ( L - V ) , moderate salinity and low salinity ( two - phase ) with relatively narrow TH ( L - V ) ranges .
Thus , the authors have concluded that the sample has experienced some later 718 thermal disturbance , but had an initial cooling and potassic alteration age of ≥21 Ma .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .
The SHRIMP U - Pb dating and laser ablation ICP - MS trace element analyses of zircon from the western Dabie Mountains provide indistinguishable eclogite facies metamorphic ages around 310 Ma ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2002 ) , considered to represent the collision between the North and South China Blocks during Carboniferous producing local eclogite facies metamorphism .
The closure of Mianlue ocean started first in the Dabie region and migrated westward ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . 2006 ) from the Early Permian and to Middle - Late Triassic , causing the formation of Mianlue suture ( [ 26 ] ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating coesite - bearing marble , garnet - bearing gneiss and amphibolite from the Dabie belt also identify similar age groups to those of the Sulu belt , including the prograde quartz eclogite - facies metamorphism at ~ 250 - 240 Ma , UHP peak metamorphic ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

The partial melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust was responsible for the production of highly oxidized magma and corresponding formation of Cu - Au - Mo ore deposits upon the previous subduction zone .
The Daping ore deposit formed at about 33 Ma based on the 40 Ar / 39 Ar ages of sericite from a representative auriferous sulfide quartz vein ( Sun et al . , 2009 ) . The pattern of amalgamated small blocks confined by larger ones was essential for the rotation and associated shearing of Sanjiang .
Precambrian metallogenesis
Abundant Fe - Ti oxide ore deposits are associated with less evolved basaltic magma in the Emeishan large igneous province than elsewhere in the world and the difference is attributed to selective assimilation of newly subducted , stagnant oceanic lithospheric slab by the ascending mantle plume - derived picritic magma that was originally undersaturated with Fe - Ti oxides ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .

isotopic data suggest that extreme fractional crystallization resulted in Sn enrichment in the evolved granitic magma , and the reduced magmas ( fO 2 below NNO ) would efficiently remove Sn into a hydrothermal fluid , and lead to deposition Sn - rich mineral phases ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The spreading of Meso - Tethyan Ocean separated the W . Qiangtang and Sibumasu blocks from late - Permian , and the closure Paleo - Tethyan Ocean caused the amalgamation between the two blocks as well as the earlier separated blocks ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) .
The multiple - period composite metallogenic system was inevitably concomitant with one or more the following processes in the course of superimposed orogeny ( Fig . 25 ) : ( 1 ) the superimposed orogeny tends to generate large ore cluster mostly due to the remobilization of preliminary metal enrichment in the early orogeny ; ( 2 ) The superimposed orogeny would make a complicated lithospheric structure with mantle metasomatized by various types of fluids and crust consisting of basement , juvenile crust and others .

The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction of Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting of metasedimentary rocks in the overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The regional lithospheric extension may have been the driving force for generation and emplacement of the mafic / crust derived magmas , which induced partial melting overlying crustal materials to produce felsic magmas ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) .

The reactivation craton margins and arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal , eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) . Precursor subduction - related magmatism is important because such processes leave ore - metal enriched residue in cumulate zones within the juvenile crust , which can be re - mobilized during later partial melting .

It was further proposed that the subduction of Indian continent was the main drive for the buildup of Tibet plateau ( Royden et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to the drive from oceanic continental subduction , the Cretaceous Pacific superplume event may have generated a strong far - field push toward the East Asia continental margin , resulting in subduction of the Izanagi plate and causing rifting and magmatism accompanied by the formation of a variety of mineral systems ( Pirajno et al . , 2015 ) .

Such a reaction would have led to a reduction in ɑH 2 S ore - forming fluids and consequently Cu precipitation ( Zhong et al . , 2012 ) .
Zircon grains of the ore - forming intrusions show highly negative εHf ( t ) values ranging from −18 to −26 and −20 to −35 and significantly model ages ranging of 2 . 3 to 3 . 5 Ga . For other Mo deposits formed in late Cretaceous , like Jinduicheng , Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , the co - magmatic zircons in the oreforming intrusions displays highly negative εHf ( t ) .
And the other pair was resulted from the closure of the branch ocean of Paleo - Tethys at ~ 250 Ma ( Zi et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2013c ) .
64 ) formed at 1 . 166 ± 0 . 02Ma , according to the Ar - Ar plateau age hydrothermal sericite , in the eastern margin of the block .
( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . It has been suggested that the Cretaceous Sn mineralization in the Tengchong block , Sanjiang orogenic belt , might have taken place in a subduction environment ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Xie et al . , 2016 ) .
5 ) located at the southern margin of the Chinese Altai occurs in metamorphic acid volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of Devonian Kangbutiebao Formation and are faultcontrolled ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .
is the product of rift - related ( or mantle plume according to some workers ) basaltic magmatism in a continental setting , temporally coinciding with the early stage of Rodinia breakup .
This study brought up the concept of composite metallogenic system to summarize the regional metallogeny driven by superimposed orogeny .
Despite the different modes of occurrence and ore textures in the three types of deposits , they are comparable in the gold - only enrichment and predominant fault - control ( Guo et al . , 2013 ; Tan et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2003a ) . The Au deposits Jiaodong - type in recent literature .
Porphyry Cu systems host some of the most widely distributed mineralization types at convergent plate boundaries , including porphyry deposits centered on intrusions ; skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits in increasingly peripheral locations ; and superjacent high - and intermediate - sulfidation epi - thermal deposits .
Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions , whereas car - bonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu - Au skarns , less common distal Zn - Pb and / or Au skarns , and , beyond the skarn front , carbonate - replacement deposits , and / or sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) Au deposits .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits , where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag - rich disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may form during por - phyry intrusion , with some of them containing high mineralization because of their intrinsic permeabil - ity .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .
PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes ( 10− > 100 km 3 ) of hydrothermally altered rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate sulfidation base and precious metal mineralization .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters of the world ' s Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts Pb ) .
Strongly extensional settings , typified by compositionally bimodal basalt - rhyolite magmatism , lack significant porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1999a ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .
Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .
The late - mineral porphyry lacks veinlets and displays only propylitic alteration .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Quartzalunite
Pyrrhotite may accompany the pyrite where reduced host rocks are present ( e . g . , Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 2003b ) .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Absence of anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
The parental chambers , tending to be localized at sites of neutral buoyancy ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) , are the sources of both magmas and hightemperature , high - pressure metalliferous fluids throughout system development .
The stockwork veinlets control and focus continued fluid ascent , with partial dissolution of quartz during cooling through its retrograde solubility field ( < ~ 550 - 400 °C at pressures < ~ 900 b ; Fournier , 1999 ) enhancing the permeability of the A - type quartz veinlets during at least some of the Cu - Fe sulfide precipitation ( Rusk and Reed , 2002 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) ; synmineral faulting and fracturing may play a similar role .
Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10× dilution hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .
Diatreme breccias are preferentially emplaced at this time because external water access to late - mineral magma bodies , a requirement for phreatomagmatic activity , is facilitated .
Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .
porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration has varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700° to 550 °C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .
If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps in which quartz - pyrophyllite ± muscovite ± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration mineralization .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts underlying rocks .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix of many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .
the magmatic - hydrothermal breccias and pebble dikes at the porphyry Cu level , these phreatic breccias in the high - sulfidation environment may attain the paleosurface , where hydrothermal eruptions result in subaerial breccia accumulation as aprons around the eruptive vents ( e . g . , Hedenquist and Henley , 1985 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The vertical distribution of the alteration - mineralization types porphyry Cu deposits depends on the degree of overprinting or telescoping , the causes of which are addressed further below .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
The base and precious metal deposit types carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic assemblages , and sericitic alteration does the same to potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
In some bornite - rich centers , the sulfidation state is low enough to stabilize digenite ± chalcocite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Table 2 ) .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .
The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .
Abundant hydrothermal magnetite is a good indicator of potentially Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe , 1979 ) , and the presence of banded quartz veinlets may be used to identify most , but not all , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K ± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .
Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .
Commonly , the highest grade and most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .
Progressive disproportionation of the contained SO 2 ( to H 2 SO 4 and H 2 S ) once it and HCl ( plus any HF ) condense into ground water ( Giggenbach , 1992 ; Rye , 1993 ) generates the extremely low pH fluid responsible for the high degrees of base leaching involved in advanced argillic lithocap formation ( e . g . , Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .
Injection of fine - grained , igneous matrix defines the igneous breccia near the base of the body .
However , the erosion involved in the unroofing of porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .
However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
However , the El Indio high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga and Cajamarca - Huaraz belts , respectively .
Furthermore , magmatic - hydrothermal breccia cemented mainly by quartz , tourmaline , and pyrite may be zoned downward over hundreds of meters to chalcopyrite - rich material , which is likely to persist into any underlying biotite - cemented breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Fig . 8 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .
Apart from the massive , commonly enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Hence , many of the breccias overprint preexisting alteration - mineralization patterns and veinlet types ( e . g . , Red Mountain , Arizona ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , which are incorporated as clasts .
Several types of phreatic breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .
Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Emplacement of the porphyry stocks in many central Andean deposits took from 2 to 5 m . y . , implying that appreciable time ( 0 . 5−1 . 5 m . y . )
In contrast , large high - sulfidation epithermal deposits average 1 to 3 g / t Au but have only minor or no recoverable Cu , commonly as a result of supergene removal .
( 8 ) what controls metal depletion versus enrichment during chlorite - sericite and sericitic overprints ?
Indeed , the tops of porphyry intrusions may be subjected to at least four distinct alteration - mineralization events , commencing with potassic and ending with advanced argillic , as temperature fronts retreat downward ( Fig . 14 ) .
Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .
Exceptionally ferrous Fe - rich rocks , relatively uncommon in most arc terranes , also appear to assist with development of high hypogene Cu grades as well as maximizing the wall rock - hosted component of the deposit ( e . g . , El Teniente , Resolution , Oyu Tolgoi ) .
Anatomy of a telescoped porphyry Cu system showing spatial interrelationships of a centrally located porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposit in a multiphase porphyry stock and its immediate host rocks ; peripheral proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , and sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) deposits in a carbonate unit and subepithermal veins in noncarbonate rocks ; and overlying high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits in and alongside the lithocap environment .
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
Irrespective of whether the Cu - bearing sulfide minerals are coprecipitated with veinlet quartz or , as generally seems to be the case , introduced paragenetically later ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2001Redmond et al . , , 2004 , a particularly strong correlation exists between quartz veinlet intensity and metal content in many porphyry Cu deposits , particularly in Au - rich examples ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
The main development of these bornite - , chalcocite bearing , high - sulfidation assemblages is largely confined to white sericitic alteration that overprints now - barren quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
High water contents result in magmas becoming saturated with the aqueous phase , into which the ore metals can partition efficiently ; and high oxidation state suppresses magmatic sulfide , such as pyrrhotite , precipitation , a process that may cause sequestration of metals before they can partition into the aqueous phase .
A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
Furthermore , even where appreciable Au is retained in chlorite - sericite assemblages , flotation recoveries are commonly lower ( < 60 % ) than for ore from potassic zones ( > 80 % ) because some of the Au originally in solid solution and encapsulated in and attached to chalcopyrite ± bornite becomes linked to introduced pyrite ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high temperature vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper - saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite alteration and associated mineralization .
This scenario implies episodic but focused magma and fluid ascent for as long as ~ 5 m . y .
Locally , early A - type veinlets displaying aplitic centers or along - strike transitions to aplite and / or aplite porphyry ( vein dikes ) are observed ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Heithersay et al . , 1990 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
Group 1 and 2 veinlets are mainly emplaced during potassic alteration , whereas group 3 accompanies the chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and deep advanced argillic overprints .
Even cursory inspection of Figure 6 shows clearly that erosion level is a fundamental control on the mineralization types that may be anticipated to occur in porphyry Cu systems .
Field observations and theoretical calculations suggest that parental chambers with volumes on the order of 50 km 3 may be capable of liberating enough fluid to form porphyry Cu deposits , but chambers at least an order of magnitude larger are needed to produce giant systems , particularly where deposit clusters or alignments exist ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite ± chalcocite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .
Schematic representation of generalized alteration - mineralization sequence in porphyry Cu systems system life span .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .
Note that the high - grade ( > 1 . 5 % Cu ) zone at Chuquicamata includes a substantial , but unquantified , contribution from supergene enrichment .
To date , the second choice could be taken to have been less successful , as shown by the lack of economically significant discoveries in the vicinities of the major but isolated Bingham , Butte , Pebble , and Oyu Tolgoi districts , although greenfield exploration is in its infancy in the still poorly defined magmatic arcs that host the last two of these .
Concentrations of chalcophile and siderophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance residual sulfide phases mantle source .
Partial melting of these subduction - modified sources due to post - subduction thermal readjustments or asthenospheric melt invasion will generate small volumes calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline magmas , which may redissolve residual sulfides .
Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .
Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .
Previously asthenosphere is unlikely to be a viable source except for a short period after subduction has ceased ( e . g . , Richards et al . , 1990 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , because such material will be quickly dispersed by mantle convection .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .
Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
At R - factors between ~ 10 2 - 10 5 , magmas will be depleted in Au but essentially undepleted in Cu ( porphyry Cu - potential magmas ) .
The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Ti , Nb , and Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .
) , low temperature liquids , with evidence for decompressional boiling or fluid mixing as the prime ore depositional mechanism in high grade breccias and veins ( Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Richards , 1995 ) .
Such magmas have the potential to form Au - rich porphyry and epithermal Au systems , depending on the amounts of sulfide present in the lower crustal source .
Such magmas , they argued , should be particularly suitable for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry copper deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .
These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .
These volatiles drive buoyant , bubbly magma upwards into the cover rocks to form subvolcanic stocks and dikes , or explosive volcanic eruptions if they reach surface .
At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
Given suitable fluid flow focusing , three further factors combine to cause maximum efficiency of metal deposition within relatively small volumes in porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .
Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
In post - subduction tectonic settings Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 , such as subduction migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting , a subducting slab source no longer exists , and magmas are predominantly derived from partial melting of the upper plate lithosphere .
Finally , partial melting of predominantly reduced , sulfide - rich crustal rocks in orogenic settings may lead to chalcophile and siderophile element - depleted , but potentially lithophile element - rich S - type magmas ( see Section 2 . 6 ) .
Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .
Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .
argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .
In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .
Also shown are the thermal structure , fluid flow pathways and characteristics during the main stage of hydrothermal activity , and overlapping hydrothermal alteration zones .
The relatively high oxidation state arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .
Consequently , the bulk of Cu - sulfide mineralization occurs at the low - temperature , late - stage end of the potassic alteration phase , just prior to the onset of phyllic alteration ( i . e . , corresponding to the " ore shell " of the classic Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 , porphyry Cu model ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .
Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
In contrast , some porphyry Mo and all porphyry Sn - W deposits are associated with felsic granitoids , derived primarily from melting of continental crust during intra - plate rifting events .
old ) and therefore still hot oceanic crust , and Peacock et al . ( 1994 ) were even more restrictive ( b5 m . y .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .
Consequently , it is in collisional orogens such as the Neo - Tethyan belt of southeastern Europe and southern Asia that some of the clearest examples of post - subduction magmatism and mineralization are found .
Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .
This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .
In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .
Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
As discussed in Sections 2 . 1 . 1 and 2 . 5 . 1 , chalcophile and siderophile elements partition strongly into sulfide phases exsolving or crystallizing from silicate melts .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .
A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .
Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .
Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .
In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .
This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .
Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .
This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .
Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations , forming sulfur - undersaturated magmas that can further assimilate sulfides during ascent .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability of minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Porphyry Cu deposits almost do have systematically higher oxygen fugacities and FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
Anhydrite is a popular mineral identified in most veins ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
High Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios indicate very high oxygen fugacity , comparable to those of Chuquicamata ( Fig . 12 ) .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .
Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
crystallizes below 950 °C in silicic calc - alkaline magmas ( Green and Watson , 1982 ) .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .
Water is the most abundant volatile component released during plate subduction .
Increasing Zn Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .
Crystallization sulfide cannot explain this phenomenon , because Ni and Pt are even more chalcophile than Cu , with partition coefficients between sulfide and silicate melts of several hundreds and more than 20 thousand , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Fractional crystallization of garnet and / or amphibole plays no positive role in Cu mineralization , either ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Porphyry deposits have very well developed alteration zones that typically affect several cubic kilometers of rock ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Titley , 1981 ) ( Fig . 30 ) , which is of critical importance to understanding porphyry mineralization processes and improving their exploration .
Dominant mineral changes from biotite in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , to K - feldspar in more granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Sericitic alteration in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints the potassic and chlorite sericite assemblages .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Hydrogen and methane form during the final mineralization porphyry deposits .
At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
The reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either simply distal host rocks located as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry underneath , or originally oxidized magmas that were reduced through assimilation of reducing components .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in melts is present as sulfate , such that the solubility of sulfur increases from 1300 ppm to 2 wt . % .
B . Porphyry deposits are associated with slab melts ( modified after Wilkinson , 2013 ) , which have high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ) .
The Cu - Au and Mo mineralizations that occur in the same ore bodies usually do not happen at the same time , indicating different sources and / or different mineralization processes .
The porphyry is an adakite formed at ~ 170 Ma ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2006a , b ) .
The oxygen fugacity can also reach the HM buffer during sulfate reduction and mineralization ( Fig . 10 ) , likely because of the lower FeO contents .
The reduction Au during magma evolution is well - known in arc magmas ( Moss et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Togashi and Terashima , 1997 ) , and has been referred to as the magnetite crisis .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .
The Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with a nearby pluton on Mt Washington ( 35 - 41 Ma ) , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The Baogutu adakites have been attributed to the mixing of ~ 95 % slab melt with 5 % sediment derived melt in the Late Carboniferous close to a subducting spreading ridge ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) .
The sulfide phase contains high Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements , such as Ni , Re , and Pt .
The alteration is characterized by transformation mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
This oxygen buffer technique was first developed by Eugster in 1957 to prevent oxidation of iron during growth of hydrous ferrous silicates and then later to determine the stability annite ( Eugster , 1957 ; Eugster and Wones , 1962 ; Wones and Eugster , 1965 ) .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
During metamorphism of the subducting slab , S is mobile from metamorphic rocks ranging in grade from blueschist to amphibolite ( Sun et al . , 2013a ; Tomkins , 2010 ) , such that they can release S and chalcophile elements to the mantle wedge ( J . L .
A small sulfur - ( N 3 wt . % ) and copper - rich ( N0 . 5 wt . % ) fine - grained igneous rock known as " Porphyry A " stock ( b1 km 3 , 6 . 09 ± 0 . 18 Ma ) ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) has abundant igneous anhydrite , with varied textures ranging from interstitial to poikilitic and corresponding modal abundances from 10 to 20 % , respectively .
Felsic : Adakite is formed by partial melting of basaltic rocks , such that they should logically be more felsic than peridotite melts ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
( 11 ) , degassing of SO 2 indeed consumes oxygen , such that it may lower the oxygen fugacity of the system .
The first limb formed early through partial melting of the hot subducting plate .
Similar to Catface , there are also adakites in Baogutu .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
( 25 ) ) , releasing H + , which lowers pH and promotes further oxidation of ferrous Fe .
Many large porphyry Cu - Au deposits are connected to subduction aseismic ridges ( Fig . 27 ) ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Meanwhile , sulﬁde undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized magmas , such that no sulﬁde segregation is expected ( Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Therefore , the crystallization of magnetite and hematite tends to lower the proportions of ferric iron in the magma , which apparently would lower the oxygen fugacity .
Therefore , S - Pb isotopes cannot place any decisive constraints on the role of assimilation in forming the deposit .
All types of porphyry deposits , ranging from Cu + Au deposits , may be oxidized sufficiently to reach the redox states of the HM buffer .
However , at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , ~ 5 - 10 % of partial melting is enough to eliminate residual sulfide from the subducted oceanic crust , forming adakitic melts with high Cu and S contents up to 2000 ppm and percent levels , respectively .
For example , Cenozoic porphyry deposits located in island arcs in the southwestern Pacific are all Cu - Au deposits , e . g . , Grasberg and Batu Hijau in Indonesia ; Panguna and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea ; Lepanto - Far South East , Tampakan , Atlas and Sipilay in the Philippines ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
In addition , degassing cannot explain the decoupling between δD isotope compositions .
For example , epithermal deposits formed in the mid - ocean ridge and backarc basins usually do not have any associated porphyry deposit .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control K + / H + ratio magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting subducted oceanic slabs .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large amount of Cu .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Based on similar Zn / Fe T ratios of mantle peridotite and primitive arc magmas , it has been argued that primary arc magmas are not necessarily oxidized ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .
Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
The uniform and low SO 3 contents in apatite from reduced magma deposits were used to argue that the low oxygen fugacity of these porphyries is primary ( Fig . 20 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .

Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence garnet and absence of plagioclase .
In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .
This is one reason why the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magma did not change much ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or even decrease slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( see also Section 5 ) .
One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .
Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
This can best be explained by the reduction of Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
There are several ways to describe the oxidation ferrous Fe .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
It is not clear whether the portion of the subducting slab underneath Qulong was continental or oceanic .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
The geodynamic and architectural controls on porphyry formation in this complex tectonic zone are unclear ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene magnetite and hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .
This plausibly explains the common association between high - Mg adakites and porphyry Cu deposits .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .
Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .
Basic principles of isotope geochemistry dictate instead that in degassing , i . e . , evaporating , the remaining liquid becomes isotopically heavier H and O .
For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
The problem with this model is that no studies have ever demonstrated that adakites are more hydrous than normal arc rocks .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .
Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .

Consistently , the Mo / Cu ratios of these deposits are generally more than 20 times higher than the primitive mantle ratio value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , suggesting that Mo has been added to the porphyry deposits from different sources .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
The spatial distribution of ore - forming elements at different scales is of primary importance for ore exploration , and researches in recent decades have demonstrated that similarity exists at different scales , or non - scale distribution , which can be investigated by fractal theory .
The total width f ( α ) spectrum reflects the enrichment in concentration of elements in local space .
For pyrite from the same mineralization stage , different samples show more or less different trace element distributions and even a single pyrite crystal may contain different levels of trace elements .
This multifractal procedure has been used to characterize variability of many natural phenomena , including characteristics of mineralization and mineral deposits ( Carlson , 1991 ; Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Sanderson et al . , 1994 ; Agterberg , 1995 ; Turcotte , 1997 , 2002 ; Gumiel et al . , 2010 ; Arias et al . , 2011 ) .
In recent years , fractal and multifractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .
We note , however , that fractured parts of the crystals often contain higher levels of trace elements .
Hence , in this study , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising parameters to discriminate between mineralized veins developed at different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body of the Dexing Porphyry copper Deposit .
To achieve this objective , the distribution Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
These samples were analyzed using transmitted light microscopy , XRD and ESEM .
Based on this shape characterization , the multifractal distribution can be divided into two groups , one is the left - deviation ( ∆α L ) continuous multifractal mode , and the other is the right - deviation ( ∆α R ) mode ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) .
This is consistent with field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis and previous investigations by other authors including Mao et al . ( 2011 ) , showing that the D - type veins are the most important for the mineralization in the Dexing porphyry deposit .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body .
The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low - quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO 4 , Fe , and associated metal ( loid ) s . Acid generated during the oxidation of pyrite [ FeS 2 ] , pyrrhotite S ] and other sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .
Sulfide ore minerals are generally concentrated by milling and froth flotation , which produces tailings containing gangue minerals and residual sulfides .
The pH of tailings pore water and drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .
The mineralogical and geochemical composition of sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
Under moderately acidic to circumneutral pH conditions , the mobility of several dissolved metal ( loid ) oxyanions including H2AsO4 - , SeO4 2 - and Sb ( OH ) 6 - is limited by sorption onto positively charged mineral surfaces .
The extent of acid neutralization and , therefore , pore - water pH is a principal control on the mobility of sulfide - oxidation products within tailings deposits .
The oxidation of pyrite , pyrrhotite and other sulfide minerals releases SO 4 , Fe and associated metal ( loid ) s to tailings pore water .
For example , common sources of As in sulfide ore deposits and associated mine wastes include arsenopyrite [ FeAsS ] and arsenian pyrite [ Fe ( AsxS ( 1 - x ) ) 2 ] .
Understanding the dynamics of these interrelated geochemical and mineralogical processes is critical for anticipating and managing water quality associated with sulfide mine tailings . Geochemistry and mineralogy of sulfide mine tailings are reviewed Case studies highlight metal transport and attenuation processes Interactions among chemical , biological and physical processes are complex Effective tailings management requires comprehensive understanding of processes
The extent of environmental impacts associated with sulfide tailings deposits depends upon their mineralogical and geochemical composition , and upon in - situ chemical , biological processes .
These three case studies provide valuable insights into a range of geochemical and mineralogical aspects of sulfide mine tailings .
Rather than providing an incremental update to the information provided in these publications , this review combines information derived from three detailed case studies with current literature to illustrate the processes and conditions that control sulfide - mineral oxidation and the subsequent mobility of associated reaction products within sulfide mine tailings .
Porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits are intrusion centered , and are formed at ≤4 and ≤1 km depth , respectively , by fl uids exsolved from magmas emplaced at ~ 5 - 10 km depth in the upper crust ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
The cumulate residues from this process can be seen in exhumed lower crustal - upper mantle arc sections such as Talkeetna ( Alaska ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ) and Kohistan ( Pakistan ; Jagoutz et al . , 2007 ) .
POSTSUBDUCTION MAGMATIC - HYDROTHERMAL ORE DEPOSITS Extensional or Transtensional Environments and Alkalic - Type Epithermal Au Deposits
The porphyry deposits in these settings closely resemble those from subduction - related arcs , except for a relationship to mildly alkaline intrusions , and a tendency to be relatively Au rich and Mo poor .
Postsubduction magmatism resulting from lithospheric thickening , thermal rebound , mantle lithosphere delamination , or lithospheric exten - sion shares many geochemical and isotopic characteristics with subduction - related calc - alkaline magmatism , but tends to be more alka - line ( shoshonitic , hawaiitic ) , less sulfur rich , and more isolated in distribution and timing .
Such magmas are derived by remelting of the meta somatized roots of former arc magmatic systems , from which they inherit their arc geo - chemical signature and metal endowment .
Thus , fi rst - stage arc magmas tend to generate Cu - rich porphyry systems , while leaving a relatively Au - rich residue in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle ( Richards , 2005 ) .
The resulting magmas are more felsic , commonly with calcalkaline to mildly alkaline character , and have crustal radiogenic isotopic signatures ( Harris et al . , 1986 ; Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ) .
If this fertile , hydrous residue is subjected to a second stage of melting , either by invasion of small volumes of hot , oxidized asthenospheric magma , or thermal rebound after lithospheric thickening ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) , then Au - rich residual sulfide phases may redissolve ( R ≥ 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) to generate magmas high Au / Cu ratios ( Solomon , 1990 ; Richards , 2005 ) and perhaps also PGE enrichments ( cf .
The recognition that porphyry Cu - Au and related epithermal Au systems can also form in postsubduction tectonic settings expands the range of geological environments and geographical terranes that are prospective for such deposits .
Recently , a number of porphyry Cu - Au deposits have been described in association with such magmas , with ages and from locations that are incompatible with a relationship to contemporaneous subduction , but consistent with postsubduction or collisional tectonic settings .
All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
Late - stage partition - ing of these metals into hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved during cooling and crystallization of this magma at upper crustal levels generates magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits superﬁ - cially similar to arc - related porphyry deposits , but more enriched in Au and of generally lower sulﬁ dation state .
However , because of the transience of these events ( compared with steady - state subduction ) , the magmas will be formed in relatively small volumes and at relatively low degrees of partial melting ( Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) .

Richards * ABSTRACT Porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au and some epithermal Au deposits are formed from hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved from cooling , water - rich , calc - alkaline magmas emplaced in volcanoplutonic arcs above subduction zones .
Zircons from In summary , the duration of the Pulang complex may last only several millions Pulang complex . 2006 ; Pang et al . , 2009 ) .
The sulfide - unsaturated magma would dissolve sulfides , if any , in the crust and elevate its PGE contents due to extremely high PGE budget in such sulfides .
Both the intrusive complex and the related volcanic wall rocks have similar PGE concentrations , Pd / Pt ratios and primitive mantle - normalized PGE patterns , indicating that no discernible Two types of amphibole , i . e . , high - Al ( Al2O3 = 9 . 4 – 11 . 8 wt . % ) and low - Al ( 5 . 9 – 7 . 3 wt . % ) types , have been identified in the Pulang complex .
Consequently , large amounts of Cu - rich sulfides accumulated there may have been remobilized and contributed to later porphyry - related metallogenic event ( s ) ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2017 ) .
In contrast , the magma that equilibrated with the low - Al amphibole was likely formed at a much shallower depth ( 89 – 202 MPa , ca .
It is estimated that the magma equilibrated with the high - Al amphibole may have contained up to 6 . 2 wt . % H2O , and was formed under 334 – 538 MPa ( ca .
216 – 217 Ma and titanium - in - zircon temperatures of 685 – 706℃ , indistinguishable from those of the syn - mineralized MP and QMP ( 215 . 9 Ma and 695 ± 20℃ , and 215 . 1 – 217 . 1 Ma and 676 – 698 ℃ , respectively ) ( Table 1 ; Fig . 5 ) .
Therefore , IPGE - depleted signatures of the Pulang intrusive and extrusive rocks suggest that the parental magmas may have formed by low - degree ( < 11 % ) partial melting of a PGE - depleted mantle source .
This , however , does not support a co - magmatic origin , because no enrichments in incompatible elements were found in the volcanic rocks over the intrusive rocks , and both rock types are mafic than the intrusive rocks ( Fig . 10 ) , precluding the third model .
Hydrothermal mineralization can cause enrichment or depletion of elements in ore bodies and surrounding country rocks .
The α and f ( α ) values of the singularity spectrum were computed with Eq .
Generally , all of the pyrite contains variable concentrations of Cu and other elements .
Furthermore , a parameter called asymmetry index ( Rα ) of multifractal spectrum curve , can effectively provide information about the ore - forming potential assessment .
Other important methods include analysis of frequency distributions and spatial correlation of element concentration values .
Based on the analytical results and other previous investigations , the vein systems were divided into four main vein types and associated alteration and mineralization stages .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
The alteration zones in the deposit transit upward and outward from early potassium silicate , through quartz - sericite , to later propylitization .
The Pulang ore deposit , one of the largest porphyry copper deposits in China ( Deng et al . , 2012 , 2014a ; Mao et al . , 2012 , 2014 ) , is character - ized by typical porphyry type alteration zone .
Controls on Cu distribution According to the various fractal indices , the mineralized drillcores in the quartz–sericite zone have more homogeneity , stronger compact - ness of high concentrations , and greater proportion of high concentra - tions in the Cu distribution than the non - mineralized drillcores .
In this paper , various fractal indices exponent of lacunarity , multifractal spectrum , correlation dimension and Hurst exponent , are applied to characterize the Cu spatial distribution in 114 drillcores in the Pulang ore deposit , with the aim to correlate the element spatial pattern with its dynamic drive .
Quantitative description of the spatial distribution of ore forming elements in mineral deposits is signiﬁcant for the mineral exploration and understanding of ore - forming processes .
Set ( e ) could represent the case of thick stable orebody in potassium - silicate zone .
Variations of the former three indices suggest that the core of mineralized zone has more homogeneity , stronger compactness of high concentrations , and greater proportion of high concentrations in the Cu distribution compared to the other parts of the deposit .
Deng et al . ( 2011 ) demonstrated that the Δf ( α ) values for intense mineralization are lower than those for moderately and weakly mineralized areas in structure - controlled dis - seminated gold deposit , suggesting that there are more high concentra - tions than low ones in the former .
This interpretation from the fractal perspective is consistent with the geolog - ical cognition for the formation porphyry deposits .

It means that the complexity of controls underpinning the system is closely correlated to the homogeneity of elemental spatial pattern and to higher mineralization intensity .
Andean Intrusive Suite ( AIS ) is dominated by granodiorite , tonalite and gabbroic compositions , which has a high potential for Cu , Mo , Au and Ag mineralization associated with hydrothermal alteration zones of propyllitic and argillic grades ( Kameneva and Grikurov , 1983 ; Rowley et al . , 1983 ; Crockett and Clarkson , 1987 ) .
Alteration mineral assemblages in the northern sector of the study area are composed of chlorite muscovite , muscovite , hematite and Mg - OH absorption units ( Fig . 5 ) .
Granite exposures located near Starbuck and Flask glaciers in southern part Oscar II Coast region consistently map as dense blue pixels ( highly felsic rocks ) in Figure 6 .
The capability to distinguish fractional abundance of alteration minerals kaolinite , illite , montmorillonite , epidote , chlorite and biotite using target detection algorithms provided invaluable information for discrimination lithological units in remote and inaccessible zones at the district scale .
Some prospecting zones for Cu Ag mineralization associated with altered lithologies of Andean Intrusive Suite ( AIS ) were suggested in the southern sector of the study region .
While several maps of Antarctica geology have been drawn at various scales , but there is currently an effort to increase the detail of coverage of geological maps .
For that reason , felsic trend lithological units appear as blue pixels in the CR image map of the study area ( Fig . 6 ) , which indicates lower spectral emissivity and surface temperature than the other geological units .
In this research , the north - eastern Graham Land , AP was selected to conduct a remote sensing satellite - based mapping approach to detect poorly exposed lithological units and alteration mineral assemblages in the Antarctic environments .
Fractional abundance of alteration minerals chlorite and biotite were detected in poorly exposed lithologies using target detection algorithms .
The magenta pixels are the lithological units with higher surface temperature and mafic trend ( Fig . 6 ) .
The magenta pixels match with lithological units consisting of quartz - rich basic classes ( Fig . 6 ) .
Sub - pixel abundance value of mafic alteration minerals montmorillonite ( K - feldspar alteration products ) and muscovite was detected using ASTER SWIR bands in poorly mapped and unmapped regions in the north - eastern Graham Land , AP .
ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and lithological units ( mafic felsic trend ) for poorly mapped and / or unmapped regions .
Cyan - dominated pixels show the influence of Al - OH absorption ( muscovite ) and Mg - O - H CO3 absorption ( chlorite ) features simultaneously .
The red pixels generally reflect the abundance of hematite and goethite .
Moreover , in some zones , red pixels as indicative of iron oxide / hydroxide minerals and cyan pixels as representative of muscovite chlorite assemblages are distributed outside the exposed rock context , especially in glacier bed and glacier flow in the northern sector and southwestern part of the southern sector of the study area ( Fig . 5 ) .
As a result , the appearance of green pixels is due to the abundance of kaolinite and muscovite , and blue pixels are attributed to the abundance of biotite , chlorite , amphiboles , epidote and calcite in the exposed rock zones .
A two - stage methodology was adopted to distinguish pixel and sub - pixel targets in the satellite images .
It should be noted that the CR mapping tool was not capable in some subtle discriminations between alteration mineral assemblages muscovite , chlorite , biotite , chlorite and epidote .
Generally using the CR image map ( Fig . 5 ) , pixels composed of distinctive absorption features of alteration mineral assemblages associated with poorly exposed lithologies were detected especially in unmapped zones of the north Graham Land at the regional scale .
Accordingly , the image map derived from CR mapping tool to bands 5 , 7 and 10 of Landsat - 8 could comprehensively display poorly exposed lithologies and discriminate major lithological units as well as seawater , glacier and ice shelf in the northern part of Graham Land , AP at the regional scale .
In this study , the applications of Landsat - 8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer ( ASTER ) data were investigated to extract geological information for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies located in inaccessible regions .
Magnetite and hematite are two common oxide minerals in magmatic , sedimentary , and metamorphic rocks ( e . g . , Ramdohr 1980 ; Scheka et al . 1980 ) and can be major to trace minerals in a range of mineral deposit types .
Terrestrial spinel shows a wide range in composition that records different magmatic histories and metamorphic reequilibration .
Partition of Ta , and Hf between magnetite and mafic to intermediate silicate melts is strongly controlled by the Ti and Al content of magnetite ( Nielsen and Beard 2000 ) .
Porphyry - Cu , IOCG and Kiruna - type high - temperature hydrothermal deposits have intermediate average Mn similar to lower temperature VMS deposits .
The average concentrations of several elements ( e . g . , Ni ) , typical for magmatic deposit types , are however significantly higher from those of other types of mineral deposits ( Fig . 2 ) .
The zincian spinel gahnite is a common accessory mineral in amphibolite to granulite metamorphic zinc - bearing rocks rich in sulfides ( Spry and Scott 1986 ; Heimann et al . 2005 ) , and can be used as an exploration tool for metamorphosed VMS deposits ( Spry and Scott 1986 ; Heimann et al . 2005 ) and Broken Hill - type Ag - Pb - Zn deposits ( Walters et al . 2002 ) .
In the Kerimasi ( Tanzania ) carbonatite , magnetite becomes depleted in Mg with magma evolution whereas Mn is shown to be more compatible with increasing oxygen fugacity , in contrast to vanadium ( Reguir et al . 2008 ) .
Based on the trace element composition of magnetite from selected VMS , skarn , IOCG , and Broken Hill - type clastic - dominated Pb - Zn deposits from Australia , Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) concluded that magnetite incorporates trace elements that are typical for a specific deposit type .
In addition to forming iron ore in various types of sedimentary ironstones , iron oxides are abundant in iron oxide - copper - gold ( IOCG ) and Kirunatype apatite - magnetite deposits .
Other diagrams such as the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or the Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V are not discriminant for Ni - Cu - PGE and VMS deposits , but are useful to distinguish IOCG from Kiruna - type , porphyry Cu deposits .
On the other hand , even if Cr , Fe - Ti , and V deposits are represented by fewer analyses ( Table 2 ) , their chemical composition is characteristic enough to allow their classification within the discriminant diagrams pre - sented in this paper .
Samples plotting outside the Ni - Cu - PGE and Cu - Zn - Pb VMS fields are discriminat - ed using the Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V or Ca + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V diagrams that discriminate for IOCG , Kiruna , porphyry Cu , BIF deposits .
Rusk et al . ( 2009 ) observed that magnetite from barren breccias is enriched in V and depleted in Mn relative to ore - related magnetite from Ernest Henry , and concluded that the difference in magnetite chemistry probably results from mineral equilibrium at the site of magnetite deposition .
Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) measured the trace element composition of magnetite from selected VMS deposits from Australia , and divided the data into three groups : group A elements ( Mg , Al , Ti , V , Mn , Co , Ni , Zn , Ga , Sn ) are commonly measured above the detection limit using LA - ICP - MS and have consistent results and elemental patterns from grain to grain in one sample , group B elements ( Cr , As , Zr , Nb , Mo , REE , Ta , W , Pb ) yielded lower and heterogeneous concentration and patterns , whereas group C elements ( Cu , Ag , Se , Tl , Te , Bi , Au ) were commonly below the minimum limit of detection .
In summary , Carew ( 2004 ) showed that magnetite from Cloncurry district IOCG deposits is characterized by higher Sn and Mn and lower Mg , Si , Cr , and Zn concentrations compared to barren ironstones whereas hematite is characterized by higher As , Ga , Sb , and W concentration .
Singoyi et al . ( 2006 ) showed that the Sn / Ga vs . Al / Co diagram has potential to distinguish the deposit types that they studied .
Razjigaeva and Naumova ( 1992 ) showed that Ti , Mn , Cr , V , Ni , Co concentration could be used to trace the source rocks of sediments whereas Grigsby ( 1990 ) used a combination of petrographic exsolution features and chemical composition criteria in a flowchart decision tree to determine the likely source of detrital magnetite grains .
Metamorphism is known to yield compositionally homogeneous , low - Ti magnetite ( Hall and Fischer 1977 ; Johnson 1979 ) , and metasomatic reactions in metamorphosed volcanogenic massive sulfide ( VMS ) deposits yields gahnite in equilibrium with its host rocks ( Heimann et al . 2005 ) .
Factor analysis reveals small but distinct differences between magnetite from the various geological settings that define magnetite varieties : ( 1 ) magnetite with elevated Mg - Mn from hydrothermal Ag - Pb - Zn veins and postmetamorphic igneous intrusions , and ( 2 ) magnetite with elevated V - Co - Zn from burial metamorphic rocks , postmetamorphic igneous intrusions and sediment - hosted Cu - Ag deposits .
However , we propose other discriminant criteria to similarly discriminate between VMS deposits ( Figs . 4 , 5 , 6 ) .
Despite extensive experimental evidence and theoretical modeling , significant uncertainty remains on the calibration of the thermo - oxybarometer at temperature below 600 °C and for oxides with minor concentration MnO , and Cr2O3 ( Sauerzapf et al . 2008 ) .
Least - altered samples from the Yulong intrusion have high SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) and Al2O3 ( 14 . 9–15 . 5 wt % ) contents , high La / Yb ( 36 . 4–68 . 0 ) and Sr / Y 1 / 58 Journal Pre - proof ( 46 . 0–76 . 3 ) ratios , and low MgO ( 0 . 63–1 . 24 wt % ) and Cr ( < 30 ppm ) contents , similar to adakitic rocks deriving from thick juvenile lower crust .
Magmatic water decrease from early - ( 3 . 5–4 . 6 wt % ) to late - stage ( 2 . 8–3 . 5 wt % ) amphibole , which is interpreted to indicate fluid exsolution from the magma chamber during emplacement of the Yulong intrusion .
Lithospheric mantle - derived mafic lavas coeval with Journal Pre - proof the Yulong intrusion are widely developed in the Nangqian Basin ( Deng et al . , 2001 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ) , which is about 100km NW of Yulong ( Fig . 1B ) .
The north Qiangtang terrane consists of Proterozoic to early Paleozoic basement and middle Paleozoic–Mesozoic carbonate and clastic cover rocks ( Tang and Luo , 1995 ) .
This arc marks the closure of Longmu Tso–Shuanghu Ocean in Triassic , which is considered to have been the main 5 / 58 2 . 1 .
These Hf isotopes and model ages overlap those of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related arc magmas in the north Qiangtang terrane ( Fig . 10 ; Zi et al . , 2012b ) .
Mixing of ancient crustal components could have happened in the source , or by magma mixing during emplacement .
Although a few inherited zircons have been found in the Yulong intrusion ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , the relatively uniform zircon Hf - O and apatite Sr - Nd isotopes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) probably indicate that crustal contamination is insignificant during emplacement of Yulong .
They have less evolved Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 9B ) , but remarkably higher REE and LILEs contents than the Yulong intrusion ( Fig . 7A - B ) .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .
They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements ( LILEs ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSEs ) , and show listric REE patterns .
Recent studies have shown that the postsubduction tectonic settings , such as the Miocene Gangdese belt and the Eocene Yulong belt in eastern Tethys domain , could also form porphyry Cu deposits ( Hou et al . , 2004 , 2011 , 2013 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ; Deng et al . , 2014 , 2017 ) .
In this contribution , 4 / 58 we present new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes of the ore - related Yulong intrusion , with the aim of providing new evidences for the origin of Yulong deposit .
This interpretation is consistent with the conclusion based on periodic sulfur zonation in apatite crystals at Yulong ( Huang et al . , 2019b ) , and is also in agreement with the repeated exsolution of compositionally similar ore - forming fluids ( Chang et al . , 2018 ) .
Depolymerisation of the melt makes it more difficult for minerals such as feldspars and pyroxenes to assemble their crystal structures , so their saturation temperatures decrease with increasing OH content of the melt .
The oldest ocean floor at the trench is Chron 23 ( 58 Ma ) at the Peru - Chile bend ( Arica orocline ) , where the slab dip is relatively steep at $34 ( Cahill & Isacks 1992 ) .
The two Neogene metallogenic belts represented by red symbols on Figure 1 are coincident in time and space with latitude intervals of Neogene strong orogenic deformation by stress - focusing into indentations in the over - riding plate , and by buoyant features ( bathymetric highs ) in the subducting plate that drag along the base of the over - riding plate , as described in the caption .
Thus , in more hydrous mafic - to - felsic magmatic differentiation series , the ratios Al 2 O 3 / TiO 2 and Sr / Y in wholerock analyses may be expected to rise more strongly with rising SiO 2 , whereas these ratios may be expected to remain flat or decline with rising SiO 2 in weakly hydrous differentiation series ( Loucks 2000 ) .
EFFECT OF PRESSURE ON MAGMATIC DIFFERENTIATION TREND
In the interval 17 - 19 S , the metallogeny switched from copper - dominant in the Eocene to gold - dominant in the Neogene , and migrated inland .
The effect of dissolving the first few percent H 2 O is to hydroxylate the bridging oxygens Figure 2 Varying the wt % H 2 O dissolved in the silicate melt strongly affects the order of mineral crystallisation from the melt - and consequently the relative rates of depletion or accumulation of various trace elements in the melt - as illustrated by this map of phase assemblages in a series of experiments on a basaltic - andesite arc magma of the composition shown in the inset .
Grey triangles schematically represent the distribution of Quaternary volcanic cones ( Isacks 1988 ) , which are absent above the flattest parts of the slab in central Peru and in Chile at 29 - 33 S , where the South American Plate has over - ridden the buoyant Nazca Ridge and Juan Fernandez Ridge .
The take - away messages from this time - space distribution of ore deposits are that : ( 1 ) the controls on metallogenic fertility operate not at the at the scale of individual magmatic centres , but rather over hundreds of kilometres of arc length including many magmatic centres ; and ( 2 ) the ability of certain arc segments to turn on and shut off metallogenic activity and migrate fore and aft while remaining magmatically active implies that copper metallogenic fertility is not due to recycling pre - existing Cu enrichments within the lithosphere , such as often appears to be the case for tin , molybdenum , uranium and fluorine ore provinces .
Depth contours on Wadati - Benioff zone ( Cahill & Isacks 1992 ) flare eastward where the Nazca plate is buoyed up by the thick crust of the Nazca Ridge ( top of map ) and by the young , warm Juan Fernandez Ridge ( 8 . 5 Ma at east end ; < 1 Ma near the current location of the Juan Fernandez hotspot ( Farley et al . 1993 ; Flueh et al . 1998 ) .
Topographic and thermal anomalies on the downgoing slab appear to act as tectonic triggers for porphyry ore formation .
Crustal thickening and dehydration also may occur , leading to increased fluid flux ( Kay et al . , 1999 ) .
In oceanic island arcs , ridge subduction may lead to slab flatten - ing and / or brief episodes of arc reversal .
Many of the deposits formed in the last 13 m . y .
Of the remaining deposits , the gold - rich Tampakan deposit may be associated with subduction of the Snellius plateau and occurs in a region of the Philippines where adakitic volcanism has occurred ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ) , an association that also occurs in other provinces where ridges have been subducted .
He inferred that the flat slab was related to an elongate swell and associated oceanic plateau related to the ancestral Yellowstone hot spot .
Although not discussed here , sutures in the overriding plate obviously play vital roles in focusing magmatism and fluid flow ( e . g . , Richards , 2000Richards , , 2003Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Widespread and distinctive zones of hydrothermal alteration provide a useful footprint for explorers .
In the last 20 m . y . , the formation of giant porphyry copper - molybdenum deposits in the cir - cum - Pacific region has been closely associated with subduction of aseismic ridges , seamount chains , and oceanic plateaus beneath oceanic island and continental arcs .
A number of factors may play a role in the formation of por - phyry systems during ridge subduction .
Similarly , as discussed above , James and Sacks ( 1999 ) argued that southern Peru and northern Chile was the site of flat - slab subduction from 50 to 30 Ma .
The structural architecture of the province is also critical ( e . g . , Gow and Walsh , 2005 ) , with reactivation of base - ment faults a recurring theme in the evolution of porphyry mineral districts .
Gabbro in this zone has Ordovician to Silurian LA–ICP - MS U–Pb zircon ages for MORB - type ophiolite assemblages ( Wang et al . , 2013a ) , and the ages of oceanic deep - marine chert range from late Early Devonian to Middle Triassic ( Feng and Ye , 1996 ) .
Hf isotopic mapping and relationships with mineralization The Late Triassic porphyry Cu and Eocene - Oligocene porphyry Cu ( –Mo ) deposits are clustered in regions with Hf values of 0 to 2 , and TDM c ages of 1100 - 800 Ma along the Garze–Litang and Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan sutures ( Figs . 8 , 9 , 10 ; Table S1 ; Xiao et al . , 2007 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) .
Cretaceous magmatism and associated Sn mineralization are probably related to the subduction and collision of the Neo , Meso Tethyan plate .
Cretaceous–Paleogene intrusions with low - Hf values and high TDM c ages , and associated skarn and hydrothermal vein - type Sn–W systems , are located within the Tengchong–Baoshan and Yidun Arc terranes , and are probably related to the subduction and collision of the Neo - , Meso - Tethys .
Late Triassic hydrothermal vein - type Pb–Zn–Cu–Ag mineralization show a wide distribution along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture , and within the Tengchong–Baoshan and Yidun Arc terranes .
Granite magmatism associated with Sn–W mineralization ( with low - Hf values and high TDM c ages ) involved old and reworked crustal components .
The Changning–Menglian Suture separates two distinct Hf isotopic domains with an old , reworked , crustal block to the southwestern part of the SJTO , and a juvenile crustal block with significant mantle - derived components to the northeastern part of the orogen .
The high - Hf and low TDM c 22 domains are present within the East Qiangtang and Simao terranes , and the South China Craton , and one low - Hf , high TDM c domain is present in the Zhongza and Yiduan Arc terranes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) .
The suture clearly represents an important boundary between the Baoshan and Simao terranes .
The Garze–Litang suture represents the closure of the Paleo - Tethys Ocean following the cessation of west - directed subduction and the collision of the Zhongza Terrane to 26 the west and the South China Craton to the east ( Fig . 2 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ; Reid et al . , 2007 ; Leng et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2008a , 2011e ; Cao et al . , 2009 , 2016 ; Peng et al . , 2009 , 2014 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ; Yang et al . , 2011 ; He et al . , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2014a ; Wu , 2015 ) .
The zircon εHf values mainly fall in between those of porphyry Cu–Mo–Au and granite - related Sn–W mineralization .
The suture represents the remnant of Meso Tethyan Ocean , and Hf isotopic data indicated that the SJTO is into an old , reworked , crustal terrane to the west , and a juvenile crustal terrane to the east .
These intrusions are characte rized by variable zircon εHf ( −3 . 7 to + 1 . 8 ) values and Mesoproterozoic TDM c ages ( 1500–1100 Ma ) , and carry mafic microgranular enclaves ( MMEs ; Table S1 ) .
( 4 ) The Simao Terrane was at a similar paleo - latitude as the South China Craton from the Early Silurian to Late Permian and shared a common northward drift tendency , whereas paleo - magnetic data show a different paleo - latitude and southward drift of the Baoshan Terrane ( Li et al . , 2004 ) .
The younger Eocene - Oligocene potassic intrusions and associated Cu– Au mineralization along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture were formed in a post - collisional intracontinental setting ( Lu et al . , 2013a , b , 2015 ) .
In addition , one high - Hf and low TDM c domain is present isolated in the low - Hf and high TDM c domains of the Garze–Litang Suture and the Yidun Arc , , which is coincident with the location of Late–Triassic and Late Cretaceous porphyries and associated Cu ( – Mo ) mineralization ( Xu et al . , 2006 ; Zeng et al . , 2006 ; Cao , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2011b ; Wang et al . , 2011d ; Leng et al . , 2012 ; ; Li et al . , 2012b , c ; Pang et al . , 2014 ) .
In contrast , the magma sources for intrusions in the low - Hf , high TDM c domains contain an old reworked crustal component and gave rise to granite - related Sn–W mineralization .
Wu ( 2015 ) suggested that the Late Triassic porphyries are related to partial melting of a juvenile lower crust induced by upwelling asthenosphere in a post - subduction setting .
Integrating the available information from tectonic events , sedimentary successions , paleobiogeography , and paleolatitude based on paleomagnetic data , the Hf isotopic maps that are presented here reveal that the Changning–Menglian Suture is an important tectonic boundary between the Gondwana and Cathaysian continents .
Several investigations were focused on the important Cu–Mo , Pb–Zn–Ag , Au , and Sn deposits including the Yulong porphyry Cu–Mo deposit , the Gacun volcanogenic massive sulfide type Pb–Zn–Ag deposit , the Zhenyuan orogenic Au deposit , the Jinding Mississippi Valley Type ( MVT ) Pb–Zn deposit , and the Lailishan granite - related Sn deposit ( e . g .
In this study , we present an overview and re - evaluation of the Cu–Mo , Pb–Zn–Ag , Au , and Sn metallogenesis in the SJTO .
Despite some disagreement , most researchers prefer the mechanism involving the removal lower lithospheric mantle along the Jinshajiang–Ailaoshan Suture , which acted as a mechanically weakened lithospheric discontinuity ( Lu et al . , 2012 , 2013a , b , 2015 ; Deng et al . , 2014b ) .
Partial melts of hydrated oceanic crust in subduction zones ( slab melts , or " adakites " ) are thought to have high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) ratios because of the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase in basaltic rocks undergoing eclogite facies metamorphism ( Kay , 1978 ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ) .
Fractionation of or equilibration with mantle or lower crustal garnet
Such partial melts will also have trace element signatures indicative of residual garnet , and will impart a high La / Yb signature to the melts with which they mingle ( Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Haschke et al . , 2002 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ; Baziotis et al . , 2008 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Chiaradia , 2009 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ) .
Slab melts might be unusually water rich , and / or might be more readily trapped as plutons because of their felsic nature , leading to more efficient generation of crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
High magmatic water content is a prerequisite for the forma - tion of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits ; thus , this para - meter can be used to evaluate the prospectivity of arc mag - matic suites .
under eclogite facies conditions , rather than melting of the overlying mantle wedge ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) .
Formed by Slab Melting The definition provided above is sometimes taken to mean that all arc - related rocks with Sr / Y > 20 are adakites , and that they were formed by slab melting .
In addition to garnet , hornblende , titanite , and zircon also preferentially partition middle - REE ( MREE ) and HREE , and their fractionation will generate magmas with progressively increasing La / Yb ratios ( Sisson , 1994 ; Klein et al . , 1997 ; Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Bachmann et al . , 2005 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) .
This leads to the formation of andesitic to dacitic differentiates with HREE - depleted normalized REE patterns , and consequent high La / Yb and Sr / Y ratios ( Fig . 1 ; Feeley and Davison , 1994 ; Kay et al . , 1999 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ) .
Estimates for initial water content in primary arc magmas typically range from 1 to 3 wt percent H 2 O ( Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ) , but may reach 6 to 8 wt percent H 2 O in some primitive arc basalts ( Wallace , 2005 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ) .
The critical role of water High water contents and relatively high oxidation states are characteristic of all arc magmas , to greater or lesser degrees ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) .
The mineralogical origins of high Sr / Y ( and La / Yb ) ratios in arc magmas do not in themselves seem to have any direct effect on the potential of these magmas to generate hydrothermal ore deposits : garnet , amphibole , or plagioclase fractionation are not suggested to have any significant effect on the partitioning of metals into magmas .
However , it is the case that magmas with high Sr / Y ratios can be derived by several postmelting magmatic processes , including the following : ( 1 ) fractionation or equilibration with garnet in deep crustal reservoirs , ( 2 ) contamination with deep crustal partial melts , and ( 3 ) fractionation of zircon .
The latter parameter ensures that the bulk of the sulfur dissolved in the magma is present in oxidized forms , and the tendency to saturate extensively in sulfide phases , which could remove chalcophile and siderophile elements from the magma , is low ( Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ) .
Inset shows progressive increase of La / Yb with SiO2 in the Escondida area , from sub - adakitic dioritic plutons to adakitic values in evolved plutons and mineralized porphyries .
Magmatic water contents > 4 wt percent H2O cause abundant amphibole ( ± gar - net ) fractionation but suppression of plagioclase crystallization at deep crustal levels , resulting in increasing Sr / Y ratios with differentiation , commonly into “adakitic” ranges , but not reflecting slab melting .
Moreover , none of these or any subsequent studies have actually demonstrated that adakitic rocks are in fact more hydrous , more sulfur rich , or more oxidized than normal arc magmas with which they are commonly coeval .
Porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Lut block of eastern Iran formed in the middle Eocene at the end of a period of extensive volcanism ; porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in the Kerman belt of central Iran formed in the middle Miocene at the end of a period of voluminous Eocene - Oligocene volcanism ; and porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Chagai belt of western Pakistan formed in four pulses during the Eocene , early Miocene , middle - late Miocene , and late Miocene - Pliocene , after a prolonged period of arc magmatism that began in the Late Cretaceous ( and is still active ) .
The porphyry - related intrusions are relatively late in the evolution of each arc and typically follow several tens of millions of years of barren volcanoplutonic activity along the same arc axis ( e . g . , Perelló et al . , 2008 ) .
The porphyry - related suites formed in continental arcs , with thickened crust in the case of the Kerman porphyries ; the Chagai belt evolved from an early ( barren ) island arc to a later ( mineralized ) continental arc .
Fertile plutonic suites in continental arcs may be recognized by their relatively late timing with respect to voluminous plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric andesitic volcanism , the widespread presence of hornblende phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and trace element compositions featuring relatively high La / Yb ratios , and lack of negative Eu anomalies ( reflecting hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization ) .
In contrast , Miocene porphyry deposits in the Kerman belt of central Iran formed during convergence of the Afro - Arabian plate with Central Iran , the collision of which caused the Zagros orogeny .
The exact timing of porphyry formation relative to final collision is unclear , but Shafiei et al . ( 2009 ) have suggested that the mid - Miocene porphyries are syncollisional and related to crustal thickening .
Ca correction factors were ( 36 Ar / 37 Ar ) Ca = 2 . 67 ( ± 1 . 87 % ) × 10 −4 and ( 39 Ar / 37 Ar ) Ca = 6 . 91 ( ± 1 . 19 % ) × 10 −4 .
This study focuses on a segment of the orogen that runs from central Iran through westernmost Pakistan , where there is a major transition from collisional tectonics ( the Zagros fold - and - thrust belt of southwestern Iran ) to ongoing subduction ( the Makran accretionary complex and Chagai volcanoplutonic belt of southeastern Iran and western Pakistan ) .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of their host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
Key to this overall process would therefore appear to be arc maturity : it requires a significant amount of time during which the flux of magma from the mantle wedge is focused along the same crustal axis for a mature magmatic system to develop .
In this paper we present lithogeochemical and geochronological data from Cenozoic arc - related volcanic rocks from the Lut microcontinental block of eastern Iran and the Chagai belt of Pakistan , including rocks associated with the Eocene Shadan and Maher Abad porphyry deposits in Iran , and the Miocene Saindak and Reko Diq porphyry deposits in Pakistan .
Synthetic K - glass and optical grade CaF2 were included in the irradiation packages to monitor neutron induced argon interferences from K and Ca .
Illite ± kaolinite alteration overprinted potassic and sodic - potassic alteration throughout the deposit and variably redistributed copper and gold .
Advanced argillic alteration comprises a core of pyrophyllite alteration associated with chalcopyrite , bounded to the west by an upward - flaring zone of sericite alteration which contains hypogene bornite , digenite , covellite , and trace tennantite .
The Pebble deposit is the only significant porphyry deposit thus far discovered in southwest Alaska .
The late , molybdenum - rich type B3 veins plausibly reflect the different compatibilities of cop - per and molybdenum during advanced fractionation and ac - companying fluid loss in intermediate and felsic magmas ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) .
Porphyry deposits typically contain discrete late hydrothermal intrusions , which are variably associated with mineralization events ( e . g . , Proffett , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Geochronology of alteration min - erals along with paragenetically well - constrained studies of fluid inclusions and light stable isotopes will be particularly important in determining the temporal and genetic relation - ships between multiple stages of hydrothermal alteration and metal redistribution .
The mid - Cretaceous has long been recognized as an especially fertile period in Alaska , particularly with respect to the prolific reduced intru - sion - related gold systems in the Tintina gold belt ( Lang et al . , 2000 ; Hart et al . , 2002 ) .
This structure controlled fluid flow during early potas - sic and late advanced argillic alteration and may also have in - fluenced the emplacement and northeast elongation of the East zone pluton .
Intense horn - fels formed in the Kahiltna flysch above this shoulder of the batholith ( Fig . 12A ) and alternates less intensely horn - felsed diorite granodiorite sills .
Variations in hypogene grade and metal ratios reflect multiple stages of metal redistribution .
The preference of alter - ation sills suggests that the intense hornfels in Kahiltna flysch acted as aquitards and that deposit geometry may reflect a significant component of lateral fluid flow ( Fig . 12B ) , as documented in some porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 1997 ) .
Regardless of whether intrusions related to the Pebble de - posit are unique , the broader host environment manifests a column of crust that experienced long - lived , episodic magma - tism and deep - seated structural activity .
There is no evidence for paleosupergene leaching below the cover sequence in the East zone .
The spatial coincidence of al - kalic intrusions at Pebble and their emplace - ment within a short time span are also intriguing in light of models which propose that recharge of subalkalic magma chambers by primitive mafic magmas may influence the for - mation of some gold - enriched porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Keith et al . , 1997 ; Hattori and Keith , 2001 ) ; although there is cur - rently no evidence that addresses this potential interaction it is a potential topic for future study .

Measured and indicated resources are currently estimated to be 5 , 942 million tons ( Mt ) at 0 . 42 % Cu , 0 . 35 g / t Au , and 250 ppm Mo , with an inferred resource of 4 , 835 Mt at 0 . 24 % Cu , 0 . 26 g / t Au , and 215 ppm Mo .
The Boyongan Bayugo porphyry Cu - Au mineral deposits , discovered under postmineralization cover during the previous decade , are part of an emerging belt of intrusion - centered Au - rich Cu mineral deposits and prospects in the Surigao district of northeast Mindanao , Philippines .
Post - K silicate alteration The timing of magmatism and K silicate alteration relative to the peripheral illite - chlorite - epidote - calcite assemblage within and beyond the pyrite halo remains unclear .
Vein stages are depicted beyond intrusion margins only when texturally and / or compositionally distinctive characteristics permit association with a specific intrusive stage .
Higher hypogene pyrite / chalcopyrite ratios at Bayugo likely led to greater acid production during weathering and more complete leaching of Cu above the base of oxidation .
Rare comb quartz unidirectional solidification textures ( stage 0 ) mark the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions .
Stage 3 quartz veins and stage 4 sulfide veins host Cu - Au mineralization of the greatest volumetric significance , reflecting the general paucity of sulfide in the earlier vein stages .
Domains of quartz - alunite - clay alteration are spatially asso - ciated with many Philippine porphyry deposits , including Far Southeast , Guinaoang , Batao Tabio , Pisumpan , San Antonio ( Marcopper ) , Tapian , Balak - 5 , Hinobaan , Labangan , Salatan , Batong Buhay , and Tampakan ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Downloaded from https : / / pubs . geoscienceworld . org / segweb / economicgeology / article - pdf / 113 / 1 / 83 / 4086847 / 83 - 131 . pdf by Yonsei University user on 28 April 2019 GEOLOGY OF AN EMERGING PORPHYRY Cu - Au DISTRICT , NE MINDANAO , PHILIPPINES 127 MGD BEP FGD s e a e e z y h a a o p L e d n o p r t i i t l - m i r i t n o i r r i E a r l y - m i e n r a i l a z i t o d n o i r t i o p e r y h p r i s e D i e x a e c e p c e a o b c r t r m i l m E y o a c e r l o d i r t i m x e p l Distance ( m ) outward from intrusive contact : 0 200 0 * The relative timing of biotite replacement of primary mafic minerals relative to specific K silicate vein stages is uncertain but is thought to be generally contemporaneous with K silicate alteration .
At Boyongan , Cu - Au introduction accompanying overprinting K silicate - stage events contributed to ( spatially restricted ) superior grade development , locally exceeding 2 % Cu and 3 g / t Au .
In both deposits , auriferous bornite and chalcopyrite were concen - trated in quartz - vein stockworks mantling the upper portions of small ( 200–300 m diam ) , high aspect - ratio , pencil - shaped diorite porphyry stocks .
Where evidence of both K silicate and quartz - alunite - clay alteration is preserved in the same rock , the quartz - alunite - clay assemblage formed later ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) , consistent with observations in the float samples from Bagacay and Magpayang .
Timing and duration of the magmatic - hydrothermal systems Braxton et al . ( 2012 ) presented the results of a high - resolu - tion geochronological study on magmatism hydrothermal activity at Boyongan and Bayugo .
These conditions enabled local supergene Cu enrichment to develop at Bayugo ( Braxton and Mathur , 2011 ) and also promoted significant ( 600 m ) lateral dispersion of Cu to form the exotic Cu deposit between Bayugo and the dia - treme breccia complex ( App .
All such events predate formation of feldspar - destructive illite - smectite - chlorite quartz - alunite - clay assemblages .
Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) documented sulfide contents of > 5 % for the sericitic alteration zones in their Philippines study , with pyrite / chalcopyrite ratios varying from 3 : 1 to 10 : 1 .
With the industry turn - ing ever more toward exploration under cover , the nuanced understanding of the anatomy , processes , pathways , and envi - ronments of porphyry formation preservation derived from such studies will contribute to the concepts guiding future discovery .
Exploration following the emerging genetic link between epithermal Au and porphyry Cu deposits led to the discov - ery of two porphyry Cu - Au mineral deposits Boyongan and Bayugo ) concealed beneath postmineralization cover in the Surigao Au district .
This raises intriguing questions as to their potential relationships to Boyongan Bayugo .
Recent mineral resource estimates for Boyongan ( measured , indicated , and inferred at 0 . 5 % Cu equiv cutoff grade ) stand at 299 million tons ( Mt ) grading 0 . 51 % Cu and 0 . 70 g / t Au , while similar estimates for Bayugo total 132 Mt grading 0 . 67 % Cu and 0 . 67 g / t Au ( Philex , 2011 ) .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH suﬃciently and the fO2 reaches the hematite–magnetite oxygen fugacity buﬀer , which in turn increases the pH fO2 .
Porphyry Cu deposits are usually closely related to magmas with high oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , more than two orders of magnitude higher than the fayalite - magnetite - quartz oxygen buffer ( DFMQ + 2 ) ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
The high percentage of S 3 À ( > 50 % to 95 % of the dissolved sulfur ) and high solubility of sulfur near the hematite - magnetite redox buffer , coupled with its lower concentration and percentage at oxygen fugacity between nickel - nickel oxide and FMQ buffers with near - neutral pH ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , provide a chemical gradient between the reaction front with high oxygen fugacity close to the hematite - magnetite redox buffer and alteration zones with lower oxygen fugacities farther away .
Crystallization of garnet results in higher Sr / Y ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Rodriguez et al . , 2007 ) similar to adakites , but this process should also lead to higher and varied Gd / Yb , which is not seen in adakites of a single magma series ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The association of adakite with porphyry copper deposits ( Thieblemont et al . , 1997 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2001Zhang et al . , , 2004Qu et al . , 2004a ; Wang et al . , 2006aWang et al . , , b , 2007bXie et al . , 2009 ) has been attributed to high oxygen fugacity that eliminates sulfides in the mantle source ( Mungall , 2002 ) .

Some adakitic rocks occur in locations far away from subduction zones or where subduction and collision finished long before magmatism ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Chung et al . , 2003 ; Wang et al . , 2005Wang et al . , , 2007aHuang et al . , 2008 ) ; these have been attributed to partial melting of either thickened ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) or foundered lower continental crust ( Gao et al . , 2004 ) , or newly underplated mafic crust ( Petford and Atherton , 1996 ; Wen et al . , 2008 ) .
Although hematite has been reported by many previous authors , little attention has been focused on the intergrowths of hematite and magnetite and their geological significance .
Therefore , ferrous iron oxidation during magnetite and hematite crystallization are of critical importance for sulfate reduction and copper mineralization .
However , most TTGs are not porphyritic , probably because only the deeper levels of these granitic plutons are exposed in Archean terranes .
Therefore , both intrusive and eruptive rocks can be classified as adakites .
Also shown are the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , hematite - magnetite ; NNO , nickel - nickel oxide ; FMQ , fayalitemagnetite - quartz , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
While it is true that slab melts absorb MgO through interaction with mantle peridotite , it is extremely difficult to apply both criteria " Mg number % 50 and MgO contents < 3 % " , because most Cu porphyries have Fe contents higher than 5 % ( Thompson et al . , 1999 ) , which requires MgO contents > 5 % to fit the Mg number criterion .
The orange field between the hematite - magnetite buffer and SO 4 2À - HS À - S 3 À reaction lines mark the optimal initial oxygen acidity of magmas favorable for porphyry copper mineralization .
However , this can only increase the Sr / Y in dacite and rhyolite , because Y is highly compatible in felsic magmas , but is incompatible in basaltic andesite and only slightly compatible in andesite ( e . g .
This is supported by the common coexistence of magnetite and sulfide in the sericite alteration zone .
For example , Defant and Drummond ' s ( 1990 ) original criterion : " MgO is usually < 3 % ( rarely above 6 % ) " was changed in Richards and Kerrich ( 2007 ) to " MgO < 3 % , Mg number % 0 . 5 ( or more correctly 50 ) " .
Subduction and arc building activity on the Paleo - Pacific Ocean margin continued to the Mid Mesozoic as the Indo - Sinian and Yanshanian orogenic cycles ( Seltmann and Porter , 2005 , and references cited therein ) .
Porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in this sector are related to Neo - Tethyan subduction .
The porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au - Ag systems in pullapart volcanic - sedimentary basins in the eastern continental margin of China can be ascribed to large - scale lithospheric thinning , delamination and thermal erosion triggered by the changing direction of the Paleo - Pacific plate from oblique to parallel to the continent margin ( Mao et al . , 2007 ( Mao et al . , , 2008 ( Mao et al . , , 2010 ( Mao et al . , , 2013Goldfarb et al . , 2007Goldfarb et al . , , 2013 .
The TEMB can be divided into four sectors from west to east , namely : Carpathian - Balkan , Pontides - Caucasus , Iran - Pakistan , Tibet and Three Rivers - Myanmar .
The porphyry Mo deposits in the Nianqing - Tanggula area ( or northern Gangdese ) developed in the back arc basin of the continental margin .
The Three River porphyry Cu belt comprises the Triassic porphyry Cu - Au and Cretaceous porphyry Cu - Mo deposits of the Zhongdian magmatic arc , and the Jinshajiang - Red River Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo deposit belt associated with alkaline igneous rocks .
The partial melting hydrated mantle wedge or subducted oceanic slab largely metasomatized and transformed the arc lithosphere during a long subduction - related tectonic process .
Major Cu - Au and Cu - Mo porphyry deposits are distributed over an interval of almost 5000 km across central Eurasia , from the Urals Mountains in Russia in the west , though the Central Asian countries , Mongolia , Xinjiang ( NW China ) , Inner Mongolia and Northeast China to the east ( Seltmann et al . , 2013 ( Seltmann et al . , , 2014Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .
These porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are genetically related to a suite of alkaline rocks , such as pyroxene syenite , syenite porphyry , quartz syenite porphyry , which are proposed to have been derived from the mantle ( Zhang et al , 1998 ; Deng et al . , 1998a , b ) .
In the De ' erbugan ore belt of northeast Inner Mongolia ( China ) , the Badaguan , Taipingchuan and Wunugetushan porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have ages of 202 ± 5 . 7 - 177 . 6 ± 4 . 5 Ma ( Chen et al . , 2010 ( Chen et al . , , 2011 .
During the Permian and Triassic , the North China craton approached and docked with the Siberian plate , closing the Mongol - Okhotsk sea ( an embayment on the Paleo - Pacific margin ) to form the Mongolian Orocline .
In this case the porphyry Mo and hydrothermal Pb - Zn systems in the northern Gangdese could have formed in the late stages of subduction and early collision .
It comprises the Narigongma , Yulong , Mangzong , Malasongduo , Zhalaga and Duoxiasongduo deposits in the north which are dated at 35 . 4 - 36 . 6 Ma ( Du et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) , the Machangqing porphyry and Beiyaskarn Au - Cu - Pb - Zn deposit in the central part have Re - Os ages of 33 - 36 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; He et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the Harbo , Chang ' anchong , Tongchang porphyry Cu - Mo , and O Qyo Ho porphyry Mo deposits in the south have ages of 35 - 34 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) .
In Tibet there are two porphyry Cu belts , the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt in the south and the Bangonghu - Nujiang porphyry Cu - Au belt in the north ( Fig . 4 ) .
They are the results of Neotethyan oceanic subduction , collision and post - collisional events during the convergence of India with the Eurasian plate .
In particular , the key role of postsubduction - related porphyry ore systems is emphasized , comprising collisional Cu - Mo porphyry deposits during the geological history of the Eurasian continent .
They are genetically associated with S - type granites and are probably derived from an upper crustal source .
Wu et al . ( 2005 ) suggested that the extensive Cretaceous granitic rocks , with an age range of 131 - 117 Ma in eastern China , were all emplaced in an extensional setting , as indicated by the occurrence of A - type granite , dolerite dyke swarms and metamorphic core complexes .
The study carried out by Qu et al . ( 2007 ) indicates that the porphyry intrusions responsible for the Cu - Mo deposits in the Gangdese belt are K - enriched and belong to the shoshonitic to high - K calc - alkaline series , characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) U , Th , Sr , Pb and depletion of high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta , Ti and heavy rare earth elements ( HREE ) and Y without Eu anomalies .
In the past 40 years geo - scientiﬁc research has been mostly directed at the western continental margins of North and South America , and the South - west Paciﬁc Islands .
So far , exploration is concentrated on the Duobuza , Bolong , Nadun , Dibaonamugang , Rongna , Narou and Tiegelong porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au - Cu deposits .
Lithocaps are temporally and genetically related to intrusions that may be associated with deeper porphyry - style mineralization ( Sillitoe , 1995a ( Sillitoe , , 1999 ( Sillitoe , , 2011Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Gold content is also low in alunite , dominantly below the detection limits ( App .
Low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap , particularly at the end of an elongate , structurally controlled lithocap , deserve special attention , as the anomaly may be caused by demagnetization due to porphyry - style alteration , e . g . , either phyllic or advanced argillic overprint of potassic alteration .
The Lepanto epithermal deposit is related to the underlying Far Southeast porphyry ; the quartz - alunite alteration halo of Lepanto is contempo - raneous with the ~ 1 . 4 Ma potassic alteration of the porphyry .
The orebodies are located at deeper positions and relatively close to the intrusive source ( Figs . 1 , 3 ) .
As the ionic radius of Au + ( 1 . 37 ) is similar to K + ( 1 . 33 ) , it is argued that Au would have substituted in alunite if Au had been present at the time of alunite formation .
The elements Sr2 + ( 1 . 27 ) and La3 + ( 1 . 04 ) are probably more related to Ca2 + ( 1 . 06 ) than to Na + or K + , due to both ionic radii and charge considerations .
For ex - ample , Pb may have a higher solubility at higher temperature in proximal locations , resulting in its transport to cooler , dis - tal location , where it is then incorporated into alunite .
Extensive advanced argillic alteration crops out for ~ 7 km along the unconformity between the basement rocks and the Imbanguila dacite formation and consists of quartz - alunite ± pyrophyllite or diaspore , with local zones of silicic alteration and a halo of dickite ± kaolinite .
The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized , alunite - bearing whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation hypersaline liquid and vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
Most have been confirmed to be faults by mapping , whereas some northeast - trending lineaments have not been recognized in mapping and deserve exploration as possible sites for mineralized veins .
At Mankayan , the intrusions related to the Far Southeast porphyry deposit exsolved the fluid which subsequently sepa - rated to hypersaline liquid and vapor ( Shinohara and Heden - quist , 1997 ) , the latter subsequently forming an acidic con - densate .
Importantly , this survey indicates that not all porphyry deposits are associated with a positive magnetic anomaly , if magnetite - bearing potassic alteration is overprinted by other alteration types .
Vectors found in this study include the following : ( 1 ) the alunite peak position at ~ 1480 nm on SWIR spectrum shifts toward higher wavelength in samples that are closer to the intrusive source of acidic condensates ; ( 2 ) in alunite the Pb content decreases closer to the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , La / Pb , and Sr / Pb increase ; ( 3 ) the whole - rock compo - sition alunite - containing , non - mineralized ( < 0 . 1 % Cu and < 100 ppb Au ) lithocap samples can also point to the intrusive source : Hg , Pb , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center .
This study examined the surface expressions of the three principal deposits Far Southeast ( drilled out ) , and Victoria ( now being mined ) .
Numer - ous linear features are apparent according to digital elevation model and reduction to the pole total magnetic intensity im - ages .
Erosion in the Mankayan district has been minimal since the formation of the Far Southeast - Lepanto system , < 500 m based on pressure estimates from fluid inclusion studies at Far Southeast ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) , in part due to its youth , meaning that only a portion of the quartz - alunite lithocap is presently exposed ( Fig . 2 ; com - pare the elevation of the unconformity with that of outcrop - ping quartz - alunite , formed at and above the unconformity ) .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits above upper crustal magma chambers represent focused zones o f magma hydrothermal alteration , and mineral precipitat ion of great economic significance ( Dilles et al . , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Liquid - rich inclusions from a boiling assemblage in DL vein have homogenizat ion temperature of ~ 370 °C and salinity o f ~ 6 wt % NaClequiv .
The similar metal ratios in magmatic sulfides , ore - forming fluids , and ores indicate that these sulfides release their metal load to the ore - forming fluids upon bulk disso lution of the sulfides during magma degassing ( Halter et al . , 2002a ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) .
The high Cs + Rb ± B concentrations of melt and fluid inclusions in sulfur - rich 2 magmat ic apat ite ( 0 . 3 - 1 . 4 wt % SO3 ) suggest a pegmat it ic environment for the exso lution o f the fluids .
The early precipitat ion of mo lybdenite from the transit ional - stage single - phase fluids could be triggered by their higher fS2 , acidity and / or lower fO2 than the early - stage single - phase fluids , as such condit ions can significant ly decrease the solubility of Mo ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) .
These coexist ing , highly evo lved melt and fluid inclusions are likely only reflect ive of extreme and localized fract ionation ( Halter et al . , 2005 ; Stefanova et al . , 2014 ) .
Although the magmat ic - hydrothermal process associated with porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) mineralizat ion has been extensively studied , the fo llowing quest ions remain not well understood : 1 ) the nature and long - term evo lut ion of source magmas ; 2 ) the main carriers of Cu and Mo and factors governing Cu - Mo decoupling during hydrothermal process ; 3 ) the origin o f the common post - ore pyrite + quartz veins and associated sericit ic alteration .
with ~ 1000 ppm Cu and ~ 20 ppm Mo ) entered the two - phase field and condensed into a small amount of metal - rich brines ( ~ 42 wt % NaClequiv .
For example , the Questa porphyry Mo deposit formed over a period of ~ 0 . 25 m . y .
The variably elevated Cu / K rat io in ID and vapor inclusions at Yulong is mo st likely due to post - entrapment diffusion of Cu .
Subsolidus evolution of ore - forming fluids and Cu - Mo decoupling The init ial ore - forming fluids of the early stage at Yulong were likely exsolved from magmas as a single - phase fluid , considering that ID type fluid inclusions ( 5 - 15 wt % NaClequiv . )
It is thus concluded that most Mo and Cu of the early stage precipitated sequent ially from the brine phase .
Upon ascent and decompression , the single - phase ID fluids entered the two - phase field , as indicated by more abundant brine and vapor fluid inclusions in shallow parts of the deposit .
Such variations are likely caused by the inhomogeneity o f init ial input fluids , the precipitat ion o f certain elements from fluid s before phase separation and / or the misclassificat ion of some vapor or liquid - rich inclusions .
A simila r pressure is also constrained from brine inclusions ( apparent salinity = 36 . 7 ± 0 . 3 wt % NaClequiv . , total homogenization temperature = 383 ± 21 °C ) of a potentially well - preserved bo iling trail in a A2E vein .
A model that invokes the input of new batches of 22 andesit ic and / or basalt ic magmas into the magma chamber can well explain the repeated exsolut ion of similar ore - forming fluids during a prolonged period of time ( Annen , 2009 ; Gelman et al . , 2013 ; Tapster et al . , 2016 ) .
Similar variat ions ( 0 - 2 wt % SO3 ) have also been documented for apatite from oxidized magmas related to porphyry Cu systems and arc vo lcanos elsewhere ( Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2002 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .
The repeated exso lution of composit ionally similar fluids during the long - lived history of the Yulong deposit requires geochemically similar reservo irs in the upper crustal magma chamber .
Therefore , the fluid pressure of the early and transit ional stages likely fluctuated over an interval o f 400 bars between lithostat ic pressure of ~ 600 bars and hydrostatic pressure of ~ 200 bars during the format ion of quartz veins ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Rifting initiated in the Middle Jurassic ( Gilder et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004cLi et al . , 2004 ) , and might have led to the upwelling of hotter asthenospheric mantle along deep fault zones ( e . g .
Fe 3þ / Fe 2þ ratios in biotites from the adakitic porphyries plot in the field between the NNO ( or SSO ) and magnetite - hematite oxygen ( MH ) buffers in an Fe 3þ - Fe 2þ - Mg diagram ( fig .
The Nd - Sr isotopic compositions of the Dexing adakites , which are comparable with those of coeval basaltic magmas from the Cathaysia Block ( Li et al . , 2003 ( Li et al . , , 2004Wang et al . , 2003bWang et al . , , 2004c and to those of adakitic rocks derived by partial melting of newly underplated basaltic lower crust ( Atherton & Petford , 1993 ; Muir et al . , 1995 ; Petford & Atherton , 1996 ; Fig . 7a ) , invite speculation that they may have occurred due to partial melting of newly underplated , thickened , lower crust .
The adakitic porphyries contain abundant primary magnetite , hematite and anhydrite in equilibrium with hypogene copper - iron sulfide minerals ( e . g .
( 1 ) The Re - Os age ( $173 Ma ) of molybdenite from the Dexing porphyry Cu deposits ( Mao & Wang , 2000 ) is identical to the SHRIMP zircon U - Pb age ( 171 AE 3 Ma ) of the Tongchang and Fujiawu adakitic porphyries , supporting the notion that the porphyry Cu deposits are related to the formation of the adakitic porphyries .
residues of garnet - amphibolite , amphibole - bearing eclogite and / or eclogite ) can generate andesitic , dacitic and rhyolitic rocks with rather unusual geochemical characteristics ( e . g .
and relatively high Mg - number ( ( 100 • Mg 2þ / ( Mg 2þ þ Fe total ) ) ¼ 47 - 60 ) ( Fig . 10a ) of the Dexing adakitic porphyries clearly indicates that they were probably not generated from a parental basaltic magma which assimilated old crustal material and concurrently underwent fractional crystallization ( Castillo et al . , 1999 ) .
$1Á2 GPa ) for garnet to be stable within the residual assemblage ( e . g .
Model 4 : Partial melting Neoproterozoic stalled slab
We consider that the flux of heat from the underlying asthenosphere triggered dehydration partial melting of delaminated lower crust ( amphibole - bearing eclogite ) in the lithospheric mantle ; the resulting magmas then reacted with the surrounding mantle peridotite to form the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 12b ) .
Additionally , the high Th contents and Th / Ce ratios of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 5i and j ) indicate that their source was probably of lower continental crustal origin ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1997 ; Rapp et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) .
Notwithstanding the fact that Late Mesozoic - present lithospheric extension ( including the formation of metamorphic core complexes ) also caused crustal thinning in southeastern China ( Ratschbacher et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2004a ) , we believe that delamination mainly resulted in the thinning of the crust during the Mesozoic in the Dexing area as a consequence of sinking of eclogitic material from the base of the crust into the underlying mantle ( Fig . 12 ) .
This age is contemporaneous with Middle Jurassic extension within the Shi - Han rift zone , and within - plate magmatism elsewhere in South China , indicating that the Dexing adakitic porphyries were probably formed in an extensional tectonic regime in the interior of the continent rather than in an arc setting .
As mentioned above , provided that the Middle Jurassic lower crust in the Dexing area was composed of metamorphic arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Shuangxiwu Group ( Fig . 8 ) , it could have a high oxidation potential which would be inherited by the resultant adakitic magmas .
Taking into account available data for the regional metamorphic - magmatic rocks , and the present - day crustal thickness ( $31 km ) in the area , we suggest that the Dexing adakitic porphyries were most probably generated by partial melting of delaminated lower crust , which was possibly triggered by upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle due to the activity of the Shi - Hang rift zone .
The relatively high SiO 2 ( 60 - 70 % ) contents of the Dexing adakitic porphyries ( Fig . 4a ; Table 2 ) indicate that they could not be directly generated by partial melting of mantle peridotite because low degree partial melting of mantle peridotite can yield melts only as silicic as basaltic andesite , or boninite rather than dacite in composition ( Green , 1980 ; Jahn & Zhang , 1984 ) .
The starting point of Curve 2 represents the composition of a metabasaltic or eclogite experimental melt , which is not hybridized with peridotite ( Rapp et al . , 1999 ) .
Rapp & Watson , 1995 ; Rapp et al . , 1999Rapp et al . , , 2002Rapp et al . , , 2003 have also shown that mafic crustal rocks can melt to produce adakitic liquids at sufficient depths ( > 40 km , i . e .
The fluids either derive metals from the magma itself 19 , 20 , 23 or leach them from the surrounding rocks .
Parental arc magmas are mostly thought to be produced by partial melting of the altered mantle wedge above the subducting plate ( Fig . 1 ) .
Saturation of a melt with a volatile phase , normally primarily composed of H 2 O , occurs in response to changes in the crystallization state , temperature and most importantly pressure magma .
Sulphide saturation of intermediate - to - felsic ( yellow and orange , respectively ) magmas leads to stripping of siderophile and chalcophile metals into a sulphide - melt phase ( purple ) .
Mafic host rocks can also host systems of unusually high hypogene grades ( for example , El Teniente , Resolution ) 13 , 71 possibly owing to the abundance of reactive mafic minerals hosting ferrous iron , which can act as a reductant .
The most copper - rich examples include the 4 - to 5 - millionyear - old El Teniente and Rio Blanco - Los Bronces deposits in central Chile , and the most gold - rich Grasberg deposit in Irian Jaya , Papua New Guinea 17 .
The minerals present in the mantle source comprise silicates ( 98 % ) , spinel ( 2 % ) , sulphides ( 0 . 07 % ) and possibly metal alloys ( < 0 . 05 % ) 26 and it is likely that the behaviour chalcophile or siderophile metals will be controlled by sulphides .
The lower crustal hot zone is believed to involve chemical variations on quite a broad scale , such as those recognized along segments of the Andean arc 44 .
Such intrusions , and release of their contained volatiles , may trigger sudden , local sulphide undersaturation in the chamber , producing a flush of metalliferous sulphur - rich volatiles and , at the same time , initiating emplacement of a porphyry intrusion 60 , 74 .
Other chemical modifications will be limited because little crystallization will occur and viscosity and density low and approximately constant 45 .
Further modifications to magma composition may occur on ascent , but it is thought that the baselevel geochemical signature is established primarily in this zone 44 , and it is possibly here that the fertility of magmas that go on to form porphyry deposits is established ( Box 1 ) .
Ascent of magmas and volatile saturation
However , an anomalously enriched lower crust resulting from the presence of pre - existing ore deposits 46 or copper - rich cumulates from an earlier subduction cycle 42 would have a significant impact on the fertility of the magmas formed .
An additional sulphide precipitation mechanism , particularly in the later stages of hydrothermal evolution , is related to the neutralization of acidity in increasingly dissociated , cooling magmatic fluids by reaction with feldspars to form fine - grained illite and clays 69 .
The most common metalliferous ore deposits are hydrothermal , formed from hot water circulating in the Earth ' s crust .
This produces a highly enriched anomaly and a depleted silicate melt .
Thus , although a trap mechanism is undoubtedly required , the processes that ultimately control the ore metal budget of fluids exsolving from the melt ( Boxes 2 and 3 ) are arguably more important in governing the total mass of ore metal and the metal tenor of sulphides ultimately precipitated .
These are remarkable geochemical anomalies in the Earth ' s crust that can contain up to 1 Gt of sulphur 16 , 200 Mt of copper , 2 . 5 Mt of molybdenum and 2600 t of gold 17 .
Suffice to say that the effect of volatile exsolution on melt redox state remains a complex and unsolved problem .
Yet it is unclear why these magmas are trapped in the lower crust for extended time periods .
Ultimately , separation of a magmatic volatile phase ( MVP ) enriched SO 2 and other volatile components is a key step in the transfer of metals from arc magmas into the highly mobile and buoyant hydrothermal fluids from which porphyry and related epithermal ore bodies form 19 , 23 .
Recent models have proposed that cooling and expansion of vapour - like fluids is the primary control of ore deposition 65 as the solubility of sulphides is strongly related to temperature and the density of transporting fluids 66 , 67 .
Nonetheless , the ubiquity of the depositional processes would seem to make precipitation efficiency an unlikely key trigger for the formation of rare large deposits .
Here , it is suggested that certain hydrothermal systems have what is referred to as a predisposition to form ore - the enrichment of a system in metals at depth that leads to a subsequent evolutionary path towards ore formation , involving a not - unusual sequence of crustal processes .
This synthesis helps to constrain the heterogeneous distribution porphyry and their associated epithermal ore deposits in time and space .
Another way of considering this is that precipitation efficiency varies by only one order of magnitude in mineralizing hydrothermal systems and , in the few cases where it has been documented , is > 85 % ( refs 98 , 99 ) .
In theory , it should be possible to identify geochemical tracers of the process or processes enriched a certain arc segment in the ore - forming ingredients : metals , sulphur and water .
Melting also occurs at lower temperatures if the mantle has been oxidized and hydrated by volatile species derived from the downgoing slab ; this is potentially one of the reasons why subduction - related arc magmatism favours the formation of ore deposits in contrast to other parts of the Earth .
The link between this process and the propensity of magmas to go on to form ore deposits is uncertain 52 , but cyclic replenishment by mantle - derived basalts has been suggested as a mechanism for ramping up the content of volatiles and metals during amphibole fractionation 81 , 82 .
One key piece of evidence is the link between times when subduction slowed by the presence of buoyant , topographic features such as ocean ridges on the downgoing plate ( Fig . 1 ) and the subsequent formation of large ore deposits 17 .
Trigger 4 ( Box 4 ) , as previously argued , may be innate to intrusion - centred hydrothermal systems and so does not distinguish between fertile and barren systems ; it does not matter how efficient precipitation processes are if the fluids involved contain low concentrations of metals and / or sulphur .
However , this view poses an interesting mass - balance conundrum for oredeposit modellers because low metal concentrations require very large fluid fluxes for the formation of giant deposits .
However , recently this paradigm has been challenged by the recognition that ore fluids in sediment - hosted [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] , epithermal 6 , 7 and porphyry - related [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] hydrothermal deposits can carry orders of magnitude more metal than was previously considered probable , or measured in modern fluid samples .
Exploration companies would then be able to identify prospective parts of the Earth ' s crust more rapidly , therefore lowering both the economic and environmental cost .
Although this idea remains speculative , such a predisposition has been suggested in the context of giant hydrothermal gold deposits 80 .
Apatites from the different deposit types also have distinct trace element compositions that are readily discriminated by the discriminant functions .
Apatites from alkalic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the North American Cordillera possess high V contents ( 2 . 5–337 ppm ) , whereas apatites from calc - alkaline porphyry Cu - Au deposits have high Mn contents ( 334–10 , 934 ppm ) and typically large negative Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–1 . 1 ) .
Apatites from orogenic Ni - Cu , porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia deposits have relatively low abundances of impurity cations .
Intermediate and mafic rocks have similar to slightly higher P2O5 contents , typically ranging from ~ 0 . 1 to 1 wt % ( Belousova et al . , 2001 ; Campos et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 2011 ) .
Apatites from carbonatites are characterized by high Si ( < 0 . 05–1 . 3 wt % ) , V ( < 2–1 , 466 ppm ) , Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , Nb ( < 0 . 4–19 ppm ) , Ba ( 1 . 8–275 ppm ) , and Th ( 1 . 6–661 ppm ) contents , the lowest W ( < 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) contents , strongly LREE enriched REE distribution , positive Ce anomalies ( Ce / Ce * = 1 . 0–1 . 7 ) , and by the lack of Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ; Figs . 4a , 5a ) .
Apatites from carbonatites are characterized by high Si ( < 0 . 05–1 . 3 wt % ) , V ( < 2–1 , 466 ppm ) , Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , Nb ( < 0 . 4–19 ppm ) , Ba ( 1 . 8–275 ppm ) , and Th ( 1 . 6–661 ppm ) contents , the lowest W ( < 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) contents , strongly LREE enriched REE distribution , positive Ce anomalies ( Ce / Ce * = 1 . 0–1 . 7 ) , and by the lack of Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ; Figs . 4a , 5a ) .
Carbonate melts are characterized by very high Sr , Ba , P , V , and REE ( LREE - enriched ) abundances ( Nelson et al . , 1988 ; Bell , 1989 , 2005 ; Hammouda et al . , 2010 ; Jones et al . , 2013 ) , explaining the consistently high LREE in apatites from carbonatites .
Mo ± Au ( this includes both porphyry Cu - Au and porphyry Cu - Mo subtypes ) are distinguished from other deposit types in the DP3 - 1 vs . DP3 - 3 space ( Fig . 10b ) .
Apatites from Au - Co skarn deposits ( Minyari , Australia , and Racine , British Columbia ) typically contain the lowest Sr and Eu contents ( Table 4 , Fig . 9b ) found in this study .
breccia deposit generally have higher Ca contents and cor - respondingly lower abundances of impurity cations , although some apatite grains have much higher SLREE contents ( 14 , 872–19 , 050 ppm ) than those of apatite from Kiruna - type deposits ( 171–9 , 582 ppm ) .
Apatites from carbonatites are characterized by the high - est Si ( < 0 . 05–1 . 30 wt % ) , V ( < 1 . 6–1 , 466 ppm ) , Ba ( 1 . 8– 275 ppm ) , Nb ( < 0 . 4–19 ppm ) , high Sr ( 1 , 840–22 , 498 ppm ) , and the lowest W ( < 0 . 05–0 . 55 ppm ) contents .
High Nb , coupled with low W contents , is diagnostic of carbonatitic apatites .
Apatites from Kiruna - type deposits have the highest Na ( < 0 . 07–0 . 37 wt % ) and S ( < 0 . 08–0 . 49 wt % ) , and lowest Mn ( 40–245 ppm ) contents , and display strong negative Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 2–0 . 4 ) .
The crystal structure and chemistry of apatite results in relatively high mineral - melt and mineral - fluid partition coefficients for many trace elements ( Hughes and Rakovan , 2002 ; Pan and Fleet , 2002 ; Prowatke and Klemme , 2006 ) .
The hydrothermal apatites in samples from the Kirkland Lake orogenic Au deposits contain very high Mg contents ( 969–1 , 334 ppm ) , perhaps reflecting their growth during alteration of primary clinopyroxene .
The very high LREE , V , Ba , and Nb contents in apatites are attributed to the high abundances of these elements in carbonate melts and related fluids .
The apatites from MORs can be further discrimi - nated by their relatively high Zr and low Sr contents ( Fig . 7b ) , coupled with their relatively high W contents ( Fig . 4a ; T a e b l 5 .
The apatites from the three alkalic porphyry Cu - Au depos - its studied here ( Dobbin , Mount Polley , Shiko ) are character - ized by very high V ( < 3–337 ppm ; Table 4 ; Fig . 11a ) , high Sr ( 131–2 , 488 ppm ) , and detectable Si ( < 0 . 05–0 . 43 wt % ) and S ( < 0 . 08–0 . 45 wt % ) contents , and a wide range of Ce / Ce * ( 0 . 87–1 . 71 ) .
The apatite data from Belousova et al . ( 2002 ) are median apatite compositions from carbonatites ( Fen , Kovdor , Mud Tank , and Phalaborwa ) , Kiruna - type deposits ( Kiruna and Cerro de Mercado ) , granite pegmatites ( 5 occurrences from Norway ) , and unmineralized syenites ( Oslo Rift ) and dolerite ( Crimea Mountains ) .
The high As contents found in some apatites from Kiruna - type ( up to 2 , 251 ppm ) , orogenic Au ( up to 1 , 079 ppm ) , and other deposit types are interpreted to relate to a ( meta ) sedimentary source and may indicate Au and / or Cu miner - alized systems , but are not specific to a particular deposit type .
Most Au ( ± Co ) skarns are hosted by calcareous rocks and metasomatic fluids in the contact zone are Ca rich ( e . g . , Ray , 1998 ) .
Since Mn is an important contributor to the discriminant functions DP3 - 1 and DP3 - 2 ( App .
The very low impurity cation contents of apatites from the porphyry - related Cu - Au breccia deposit are consistent with apatite crystallization from relatively low temperature fluids where cation mobility was restricted .
Studies on porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits have shown that mineralization is mainly hosted by potassically ( K - feldspar and / or biotite ) and phyllically ( quartz - sericite ) altered quartz monzonite to granodiorite compositions ( McMillian , 1976 ; Olade and Fletcher , 1976 ; Ash and Riveros , 2001 ; Duuring et al . , 2009b ) .
Therefore , multi - element discrimination diagrams have been developed to allow the parental lithology or deposit type to be determined from apatite compositions .
They exhibit strongly LREE enriched REE distribution ( Ce / YbCN = 35–872 ) , with moderate positive Ce anomalies ( Ce / Ce * = 1 . 0–1 . 7 ) and lack Eu anomalies ( Eu / Eu * = 0 . 9–1 . 2 ) .
The relatively low Sr contents in these apatites are consistent with the Sr depletion in the ore zones ( Olade and Fletcher , 1976 ) .
Compared with Kiruna - type apatites , most apatites from the Wernecke IOCG breccia contain higher Mn and lower Si , and S contents .
Although little trace element data were available on apatite from Kiruna - type deposits , our results demonstrate that apa - tite trace element chemistry has the potential to discrimi - nate between Kiruna - type and IOCG deposits .
Discrimination of IOCG and Kiruna - type deposits ( step IIIb , DP4 ) The discrimination diagrams for this step were constructed using apatite data from the Wernecke IOCG breccia and Kiruna - type deposits .
Discrimination of apatites from different deposits and unmineralized rocks ( step I , DP1 ) The purpose of the first discrimination step is to separate apatites from various mineralized systems , carbonatites , and related rocks , and rocks not associated with known miner - alization .
In the case of the Congress deposit , the high Mg contents of hydrothermal apatites may reflect the mafic protolith .
However , most of the apatite data from MORs and the unmineralized diorites and granodiorites fall within the field of various ore deposits in the DP diagram ( Fig . 7a ) .
An excep - tion is the apatite from highly altered MORs from the Mid - Atlantic Ridge , which have much lower Zr contents ( mostly below the detection limit ) and elevated Sr contents .
Previous studies have used apatite as a petrogenetic indicator , an oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) proxy , and as an indicator mineral exploration ( Sha and Chappell , 1999 ; Piccoli and Candela , 2002 ; Cao et al . , 2012 ; Miles et al . , 2014 ) .
Discrimination diagrams for apatites from carbonatites , various ore deposits , and rocks that are not associated with mineralization .
Discrimination diagrams for apatites from different ore deposits , showing contours of constant Mahalanobis distance outlining bulk of the data in each group ( step II ; Table 5 ; App .
This is due to the relatively lower temperatures and pressures of crystallization , resulting in lower solubilities of many trace elements in most aqueous fluids compared to silicate melts .
Table 5 ) , the difference in Mn contents may explain the partial misclassification of the data in Fig . 10 .
One possible explanation is that apatite has inherited the positive Eu anomaly from K - feldspar and / or plagioclase dur - ing sericitic alteration of the feldspars .
In consideration of these criteria , apatite , Ca5 ( PO4 ) 3 ( F , OH , Cl ) , qualifies as a good RIM candidate .
Table 4 ; Grimes et al . , 2011 ) contain higher Na , Cl , La , Mn , Sr , and Ce and lower HREE , Y , and Zr than apatites from other MORs .
Belousova et al . ( 2002 ) documented very high ( Ce / Yb ) CN in apatites from carbonatites and mantle - derived lherzolites .
Classification of literature data from known deposits The discrimination approach developed in this study was tested by applying it to published apatite compositions of known affinity that were not used in developing the approach described above ( Belousova et al . , 2002 ; Cao et al . , 2012 ) .
They can be discriminated from other groups using Sr , Eu , and Yb ( Fig . 9b , c ) and their relatively high As ( 17– 419 ppm ) and W ( < 1–10 ppm ) contents ( Table 4 ) .
They are separated from the mineralized systems in the log APATITE TRACE ELEMENT COMPOSITIONS : NEW TOOL FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION 1217 Sr vs . log Zr diagram ( Fig . 7b ) , consistent with their mafic parental magmas ( Belousova et al . , 2002 ) .
Con - sequently , primary clinopyroxene and biotite have relatively high Mg / Fe ratios due to the low Fe2 + / Fe3 + in the magma , which results in the substitution of Mg2 + for Fe2 + in primary ferromagnesian silicates .
Likewise , the second and third axes from the DP2 set 2 discriminate W skarn ( together with orogenic Ni - Cu ) from orogenic Au and Au - Co skarn deposits ( Fig . 8b ) .
A similar observation was reported by Bouzari et al . ( 2011 ) , who investigated apatites from altered zones from three porphyry deposits .
Variables are log10 - equivalents of ele - ment concentrations in ppm for all elements , except for Mg , which is in wt % .
We note , however , that these apa - tite discrimination diagrams are best used in conjunction with other available data including regional geochemistry , geo - physics , other indicator minerals , ice - flow history , and local geology in confirming deposit types .
Magnetite ( Fe 3 O 4 ) is an important petrogenetic indicator and pathfinder mineral with a wide array of applications including geophysical studies , igneous petrology , provenance studies and mineral exploration ( e . g . , Dupuis and Beaudoin , 2011 , Ghiorso and Sack , 1991b , Grant , 1984 / 85a , Lindsley , 1976a , McClenaghan , 2005 , Razjigaeva and Naumova , 1992 .
Magnetite as a petrogenetic indicator
Igneous magnetite from carbonatites has been investigated by a number of authors who found indicative minor and trace element signatures that can be attributed to controlling factors such as oxygen fugacity and interdependencies among substituting cations ( Bagdasarov , 1989 , Bailey and Kearns , 2002 , Reguir et al . , 2008 .
Hydrothermal magnetite from BIF - Iron ore plots at significantly lesser Ti + V values and extents past their proposed BIF field on the Al + Mn axis by several orders of magnitude .
Source rock or magma composition , temperature , pressure , cooling rate , oxygen fugacity , sulfur fugacity , silica and sulfide activity govern the composition of different types of igneous magnetite ( Buddington and Lindsley , 1964 , Dare et al . , 2012 , Frost and Lindsley , 1991 , Ghiorso and Sack , 1991a , Haggerty , 1991a , Whalen and Chappel , 1988 .
Manganese and Zn are commonly incorporated into hydrothermal magnetite at levels above 100 ppm , whereas the chalcophile elements Cu , As , Mo , Ag , Au and Pb typically have concentrations that are less than their detection limits .
Magnetite has been described as an important host for Au in igneous rocks and hydrothermal ore deposits ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 , Larocque et al . , 2002 , Togashi and Terashima , 1997 .
Oxygen and sulfur fugacity
Silica and sulfide activity
Magnetite grains commonly show textures , crystal habits , and oxidation - exsolution features , such as ilmenite lamellae and martitization along spinel planes , that reflect physicochemical formation conditions ( e . g . , Haggerty , 1991b , McQueen and Cross , 1998 , Mücke and Raphael Cabral , 2005 .
Magnetite commonly contains sulfide inclusions in many geological settings including burial metamorphic , BIF , igneous , and hydrothermal environments ( Fig . 6 , Fig . 10 ) .
Phosphates and sulfides contribute P , Ca , REE , S , and transition metals .
The quartz - iron - fayalite ( QIF ) buffer marks the limit below which Fe occurs in its native state .
In the iron ore deposits of the Koolyanobbing and Marda greenstone belts of the Yilgarn craton , the Co / Ni ratios and W concentrations in hydrothermally modified magnetite in carbonate - and silicate - altered BIF are significantly greater
Although Si is typically not significantly incorporated into magnetite , Huberty et al . ( 2012 ) reported metamorphic silician magnetite ( 1 to 3 wt % SiO 2 in solid solution , determined by micro - XRD and transmission electron microscopy ) overgrowth on Si - poor magnetite in Dales Gorge BIF , Hamersley Province , and other BIF worldwide .
Apart from hydrothermal porphyry magnetite which plots at similar Ti + V / Al + Mn ratios to igneous magnetite from barren and mineralized host rocks ( ~ 1 ) , other hydrothermal magnetite , from calcic and magnesian skarn , BIF and Ag - Pb - Zn veins , has distinctly lower ratiosbetween 0 . 01 to 0 . 5 ) ( Fig . 13C - D ) .
In general , siderophile and lithophile elements that have similar ionic radii to Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + are more readily incorporated into magnetite than chalcophile elements or cations of mismatching ionic radii when other controlling factors such as temperature , matrix / melt / fluid composition , and oxygen fugacity are favorable .
For example , subsolidus re - equilibration during cooling of plutonic rocks leads to low - Ti magnetite that is also depleted in other minor and trace elements Lindsley , 1991 , Wones , 1989 ) .
For example , sulfide minerals will preferentially incorporate chalcophile elements ( e . g .
In particular , magnetite from magnesian skarn shows this trend and points towards host rock buffering as a major control for hydrothermal magnetite in metasomatic environments such as skarn deposits .
Fig . 12B shows a Ti + V vs . Al + Mn plot where data points have been attributed with approximate temperatures - from low - temperature BIF and related iron ore ( Thorne et al . , 2008 ) , medium temperature Ag - Pb - Zn veins ( e . g . , Doughty and Chamberlain , 1996 , Hayes , 1990 , Leach et al . , 1988 , medium to high temperature hydrothermal skarn magnetite , to high temperature igneous magnetite from porphyry and Climax - Mo deposits ( e . g . , Ahmad and Rose , 1980 , Audetat and Pettke , 2006 , Manske and Paul , 2002 , Sillitoe , 2010 .
A consistently lower Ti / V ratio in Algoma - type BIF magnetite ( Fig . 13 , Fig . 14A ) may reflect changing availability of weathered material , from V - enriched ultramafic to Ti - enriched mafic , or changed oxidation states of seawater that led to variation of Ti and V solubility .
To test these suggested deposit fields we plotted our data in their Ni / ( Cr + Mn ) vs . Ti + V and ( Ca ) + Al + Mn vs . Ti + V diagrams ( Fig . 12 ) .
Classification of orebody magnetite
They show that variations in minor and trace elements between these two types of magnetite are subtle but can be resolved using multi - element radar plots and factor score plots .
It has been suggested that most spinel elements , with the exception of Mg , are retained during martitization under moderate - temperature hydrothermal oxidation ( Angerer et al . , 2012 , Sidhu et al . , 1981 .
The composition of the respective magnetite can also exert a certain control on mineral partition coefficients .
Similarly , high concentrations of Mn ( 3700 ppm ) , Ti ( 800 ppm ) , Ni ( 580 ppm ) , Cr ( 39 ppm ) , and V ( 17 ppm ) in magnetite from the Garumahishani silicate facies iron - formation from the Archean Iron Ore Group of Jharkhand - Orissa region , India , is attributed to the mixing of mafic - ultramafic debris derived from weathering of oceanic crust , and / or post - sedimentary influx of high - temperature metalliferous brines produced from fluid - rock interaction in the ultramafic to mafic oceanic crust ( Bhattacharya et al . , 2007 ) .
The identification of characteristic minor trace element signatures in magnetite of predominantly hydrothermal origin commenced with the pioneering work of Lapin ( 1971 , 1972 ) and Shcheka et al . ( 1988 ) , who were also among the first to apply multivariate statistics to magnetite minor and trace element data in order to reveal underlying compositional trends that could be used to discriminate sample populations .
However , a suite of elements , namely Mg , Al , Ti , V , Co , Ni , Zn , Cr , Mn , Ga and Sn are commonly present in magnetite of all origins at concentrations that can be detected by electron microprobe analysis ( 10 to > 1000 ppm ) .
Median values for the individual types of hydrothermal magnetite roughly confirm the porphyry fields laid out by Dupuis and Beaudoin ( 2011 ) .
The plots illustrate a distinct trend for two igneous magnetite occurrences .
Righter et al . ( 2006a ) presented new values for Ni , Co , and V partition coefficients between Cr - rich spinels and silicate melt .
Mallmann and O ' Neill ( 2009 ) demonstrate that the partitioning behavior of homovalent cations such as Ga however , is not dependent on the prevailing oxygen fugacity conditions .
Cygan andCandela , 1995 , Simon et al . , 2008 ) whereas lithophile elements such as Mg , Al and Ti have a strong preference to partition into silicates if conditions are favorable ( Frost , 1991b , Simon et al . , 2008 , Toplis and Corgne , 2002 .
One of the main challenges for researchers that investigate hydrothermal magnetite is to diligently record the large variety of minor and trace element compositions in magnetite that reflect a diverse formation and alteration history , and at the same time invoke diagnostic trends that can be used to reliably discriminate different ore deposits , as well as barren from mineralized zones .
Similarly , an ultramafic metal source has been inferred for the Paleoarchean Isua BIF that shows high Ni / Cr ratios .
Interdependencies among coexisting mineral phases can be crucial for trace elements concentrations in magnetite .
One of the main challenges for mineral exploration is the recognition of mineralized areas at increasingly greater distance from primary mineralization .
Upper threshold values are a robust approach when comparing different types of hydrothermal and igneous magnetite analyzed by different labs and under different operating conditions .
Dare et al . ( 2012 ) have shown that large laser ablation beam sizes that incorporate the host magnetite as well as any occurring ilmenite exsolutions can provide an approximation of the original magmatic composition of these magnetites .
Decreasing formation temperatures are reflected in the chemistry of the corresponding magnetite with high temperature igneous magnetite plotting at high Ti + V and high Al + Mn and low temperature hydrothermal - metamorphic BIF magnetite plotting at low Ti + V and Al + Mn values .
The overall trends in upper threshold values for the different settings can be summarized as follows : ( I ) BIF ( hydrothermal ) – low Al , Ti , V , Cr , Mn , Co , Ni , Zn , Ga , Sn ; ( II ) Ag - Pb - Zn veins ( hydrothermal ) – high Mn , low Ga , Sn ; ( III ) Mg - skarn ( hydrothermal ) – high Mg , Mn , low Al , Ti , Cr , Co , Ni , Ga ; ( IV ) skarn ( hydrothermal ) – high Mg , Al , Cr , Mn , Co , Ni , Zn , low Sn ( V ) porphyry ( hydrothermal ) – high Ti , V , low Sn ; ( VI ) porphyry ( igneous ) – high Ti , V , Cr , low Mg ; ( VII ) Climax - Mo ( igneous ) – high Al , Ga , Sn , low Mg , Cr .
In the following section we review and discuss the various factors and processes that can directly or indirectly affect the composition of igneous magnetite .
Porphyry deposits , which are commonly associated with intermediate to acid pipe - or dyke - like hypabyssal stocks , have attracted economic geologists for the past century since they are a major source of copper , molybdenum , gold and silver ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ; Williamson et al . , 2016 ) .
The porphyry - type mineralization of this province took predominantly place at ~ 370 Fig . 4 ) .
Precambrian crystalline rocks have been documented to occur in the Tuva - Mongolia , Dzabkhan microcontinents of the Mongolia metallogenic province ( Fig . 5 ; Demoux et al . , 2009a , b ) .
Precambrian rocks were interpreted as basement slices that had rifted off the margins of the Siberian and East European cratons .
Devonian - Carboniferous arc - type volcanic rocks coming from the Western Junggar terrane ( Cao et al . , 2014c ( Cao et al . , , 2016Geng et al . , 2009 ; Tang et al . , 2012a ) , the Balkhash - Chingiz arc terrane of Central Kazakhstan of the northern limb ( Heinhorst et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2016a , b ) , the Middle - Northern Tianshan arc terrane ( Alexeiev et al . , 2016 ; Glorie et al . , 2010 ; Heinhorst et al . , 2000 ; Konopelko et al . , 2008 ) and the Yili - Central Tianshan - Beishan arc terrane of the southern limb ( Ao et al . , 2016 ; Gao et al . , 2009 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) continuously accumulated on this ' oroclinal arc ' .
MORB - type eclogites and metapelites in the Tsakhir Uul accretionary wedge , which was thrusted onto the Dzabkhan - Baydrag microcontinent in SW Mongolia , have a metamorphic age of 548 Ma , indicating that subduction continued in the Early Cambrian ( Figs . 5 and 7 ; Stipska et al . , 2010 ) .
Eastward - directed slab rollback of the Paleo - Pacific plate started at ca .
Mineralized intermediate to acidic intrusions associated with the giant porphyry Cu ( - Au - Mo ) deposits of the CAMD usually include equigranular to porphyritic granodiorites , most of which have kilometer - scale alteration zones similar to those of the classic PCDs in the Circum - Pacific and Tethyan metallogenic domains ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2014 ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2010 .
The unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) represented by comb - quartz layers , alternating , crenulated layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyries were formed at the magmatic to hydrothermal transition ( e . g . , Jin et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2017a ) .
Genetical and evolutional processes of magmas associated with PCDs are commonly related to distinct tectono - thermal events in different tectonic settings ( Richards , 2009 ; Sinclair , 2007 ) .
The sulphide saturation of magmas and pre - enrichment through sulphide accumulation are among the most important factors for the generation of porphyry - type deposits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
PMDs in the Kazakhstan metallogenic province are predominantly exposed in the Western Junggar ( e . g . , the ~ 294 Ma Suyunhe deposit ; Shen et al . , 2017 ) and Eastern Tianshan - Beishan belts ( e . g . , the ~ 225 Ma Baishan and ~ 233 Ma Donggebi deposits ; Han et al . , 2014 ; Lu et al . , 2013 ; Tu et al . , 2012 ; Wu et al . , 2017b ; Zhang et al . , 2015c ) .
PMDs in the Northeast China metallogenic province are subdivided into three subtypes : the collision ( Dabie ) , rift ( Climax ) , and subduction types ( Chen et al . , 2017b ) .
The formation of high - sulphidation epithermal gold deposits ( 108 - 106 Ma ) and gold - rich porphyry copper deposits ( 111 - 109 Ma ) in the Yanbian area of NE China may also be the result of the Cretaceous subduction of the Paleo - Pacific Ocean ( e . g . , Chai et al . , 2015 ) .
The relatively depleted isotope compositions of these Triassic Mo - mineralized granites also support the suggestion that the magmas were derived from juvenile lower crusts .
The orogenic evolution of the Altaids and thus the CAMD was initially thought to have been dominated by the ca .
The switch from the terminal activity associated with the Paleo - Asian Ocean closure to the onset of tectonism associated with the subduction of the Paleo - Pacific plate may have occurred at ~ 260 - 250 Ma ( Wilde , 2015 ) .
The oxygen isotopic compositions of quartz from the hydrothermal stage quartz veins vary slightly for each porphyry molybdenum deposit , but display a large range for different deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
The melting model ( Fig . 15b ) , however , was also employed to explain the formation of some PCDs in the CAMD , such as the Bozshkol , Tuwu - Yandong deposits .
This particular geodynamic setting could have provided the heat flux triggering re - melting of previously enriched mafic lower crust .
Thus the heat flux of the outgoing slab - window setting may still have triggered the melting of juvenile lower crust , thereby producing the felsic magma associated with the formation of the Suyunhe Mo deposit ( Fig . 15d ) .
2010 ) ; TMD data from Hou et al . ( 2015 ) and Yang et al . ( 2015 ) ; CAMD data from the references listed in Table 1 .
Whereas , some PMDs - related porphyries in the Xilamulun suture zone region of the northern margin of the North China craton ( e . g . , the Chehugou deposit ; Shu et al . , 2015 ) and in the Zhangguangcai Range of the Jiamusi terrane ( e . g . , the Xingwen deposit ; Zeng et al . , 2017 ) have negative zircon ɛ Hf ( t ) values ( Table 2 ; Fig . 17b ) , indicating that an old crustal component has also been involved in the genesis of the ore - forming magmas .
The popular MASH ( melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ) model can explain the genesis of both the normal calc - alkaline and the distinct adakite - like arc rocks having the potential to form PCDs ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
916 - 905 Ma granite gneisses are sporadically exposed , implying the former presence of Precambrian basement rocks in this area ( Wang et al . , 2001 ; Zhou et al . , 2013a ) .
In contrast , the alteration characteristics of the Oyu Tolgoi porphyry Cu - Au deposit differ from those of the classic porphyry deposits because it is mainly associated with an advanced argillic alteration and characterized by high - sulphidation mineral assemblages of bornite , chalcopyrite , covellite , enargite and pyrite ( Richards , 2013 ) .
In addition , Precambrian high - grade metamorphic rocks are thought to be usually overlain by Paleozoic arc - type or Mesozoic - Cenozoic sedimentary basin sequences with very limited exposures ( Degtyarev et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2014a ) .
Some of these intrusions have relatively high Sr / Y ratios and low Y concentrations , resembling an adakitic geochemical signature ( Fig . 12 ) .
Nevertheless , most of the porphyrit ic suites associated with the Mo deposits in the Northeast China metallogenic province have relat ively depleted mant le - like neodymium and hafnium isotopic composit ions , suggesting that the ore - forming granit ic magma may have predominant ly been derived from juvenile lower crust s . Upwelling of asthenosphere may have triggered the melt ing of the lower crust during post - collisional extension subsequent to the closure of the Paleo - Asian Ocean in the Triassic , the subduct ion of the Paleo - Pacific ocean in the Jurassic and the thinning of the lithosphere caused by rollback of the Paleo - Pacific plate in the Cretaceous .
In general , the porphyries hosting Mo deposits in the CAMD have relatively depleted strontium , neodymium and zircon hafnium isotopic compositions , compared to those in the Qinlin - Dabie collisional orogenic belt and the North China craton ( Table 2 ; Figs . 17a and b ) .
In general , the porphyry Mo deposits of the CAMD have alteration zones similar to those of the classic porphyry copper deposits ( e . g . , Cao et al . , 2017a , b ; Jin et al . , 2017 ; Sun et al . , 2017a ; Zhou et al . , 2015b ) , comprising outward grading potassic alteration zones ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
In contrast , the ~ 370 Ma porphyry - type mineralization of the Mongo lia metallogenic province is related to the Tuva–Mongo lia arc collage system that was formed during the evo lut ion of the Paleo - Asian Ocean in the Paleozoic and the Mongol–Okhotsk Ocean in the early Mesozoic .
1 . 16 - 1 . 05 Ga mylonitized gneisses , gneissic granites and rhyolites as well as ca .
Althoughin terms of ore reservesrather small Archean and Proterozoic porphyry deposits occur in Fennoscandia and Canada ( Fraser , 1993 ; Wanhainen et al . , 2003 ) , the global spatial distribution of porphyry deposits generally outlines the Phanerozoic orogenic belts resulting from subductional and collisional events along convergent plate margins ( Hou et al . , 2011 ( Hou et al . , , 2015John et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
1 . 45 - 1 . 37 Ga ) magmatic rocks were reported to occur as massive rhyolites in the Ekurgenkol Complex of the Kyrgyz North Tianshan ( Kröner et al . , 2013 ) and as gneissic granitoids in the eastern segment of the Chinese Central Tianshan ( He et al . , 2015 ) .
This commonly includes a cyclical metal and water enrichment of magmas in the deep crust , sulphide saturation of the magma , an efficient transfer of metals into hydrothermal fluids exsolved from the magmas as well as the precipitation of mineralization in suitable structures near the paleo - surface ( e . g . , John et al . , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Regardless of the variable chemical compositions of porphyry - type deposit associated intrusions , relatively high oxygen fugacities ( fO 2 ) and H 2 O contents in magmas ( Kelley and ottrell , 2009 ) are critical for the formation of P Ds ( Richards and Şengör , 2017 ) .
Some studies suggest that the formation of these Mo deposits is controlled by magma source components ( the ancient crust , juvenile lower crust or continental lithospheric mantle ) , but that other factors , including high magma oxygen fugacities , efficient exsolution of metal - bearing fluids from magmas and boiling or immiscibility of fluids , may have played a fundamental role in the Mo enrichment and subsequent mineralization ( Audétat and Li , 2017 ; Cao et al . , 2017b ; Shu et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2017a ; Zhou et al . , 2014bZhou et al . , , 2015b .
The occurrence of many of the world ' s largest P Ds in Tertiary to Quaternary magmatic arcs within regions of the CPMD , from which the subduction of oceanic plateaus , and seamount chains was reported , leads to speculation on the importance of these aseismic ridge as tectonic triggers for porphyry - style mineralization ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
This contribution comprises the geological and metallogenic characteristics of 81 porphyry - type deposits that contain at least 126 . 4 Mt copper , 12 . 4 Mt molybdenum and 5388 t gold in total ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , we firstly investigate the geodynamic background associated with porphyry - type mineralization in the CAMD .
However , due to the development of high - resolution dating methods , numerous studies have documented that the ' Precambrian rocks ' are in fact mainly Meso - to Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks , volcano - sedimentary successions and intrusive complexes , only with sporadic Archean slices in southern Kazakhstan , the Kyrgyz Middle - North Tianshan and the Chinese Central Tianshan ( Fig . 5 ; Degtyarev et al . , 2017 ; Kovach et al . , 2017 ; Kröner et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2014a ) .
This view is further supported by the enriched isotopic compositions of Mo - hosting prophyries from the North China craton ( whole - rock ɛ Nd ( t ) varying from - 17 . 8 to - 13 . 7 ; zircon grain ɛ Hf ( t ) from - 19 . 9 to - 11 . 7 ; e . g . , Wu et al . , 2016Wu et al . , , 2017a , its northern margin ( whole - rock ɛ Nd ( t ) varying from - 22 . 9 to - 3 . 8 ; zircon grain ɛ Hf ( t ) from - 10 . 8 to + 0 . 2 ; Table 2 ) and the Qinling - Dabie orogen along its southern margin ( whole - rock ɛ Nd ( t ) varying from - 26 . 1 to - 11 . 0 ; zircon grain ɛ Hf ( t ) from - 33 . 6 to - 3 . 4 ; e . g . , Chen et al . , 2017b ; Wang et al . , 2017c ; Figs . 17a and b ) .
This is supported by the formation of a huge Devonian volcanic belt in Central Kazakhstan ( Abrajevitch et al . , 2007 ) .
As pointed by Cooke et al . ( 2005 ) , the formation of porphyry Cu - ( Mo , Au ) deposits is dominated by various factors such as the tectonic perturbation , architecture of the upper crust , source magma composition , efficient processes of ore transport and deposition and formation as well as preservation of supergene enrichment covers .
Additionally , the systematic studies on the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio of porphyry intrusions associated with Mo mineralization show that a positive correlation exists between the ratio and the Mo tonnage .
Although Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) proposed that the ore - forming magma and the Mo endowment of the Climax Mo deposits were derived from ancient metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle , and that molybdenum and ( part of the ) S in the fertile magmas were supplied by old crust during melting and subsequent ascent ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2011 ) .
Their assembly is thought to have been generated through consecutive subduction and collision processes , forming the Kokchetav - North Tianshan arc in the Early Paleozoic ( Windley et al . , 2007 ; Xiao et al . , 2015 ) .
In the central and southern Gobi area of South Mongolia , several ophiolites [ the 528 - 503 Ma Biluutiin Ovoo ( Zhu et al . , 2014b ) , the 509 - 482 Ma Manlay ( Zhu et al . , 2014a ) and the 528 - 519 Ma Namdain ophiolites ( Zhu et al . , 2016 ) ] indicate that the paleo - ocean was also associated with the South Gobi microcontinent .
Two distinct genetical models have previously been suggested for these oxidized ore - forming magmas and associated mineralizations : the MASH model ( melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2013Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) and the melting model ( adakitic magma generated by slab / lower crustal melting ; e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Hou et al . , 2015 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Chiaradia , 2014 ; Hou et al . , 2015 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Jenner , 2017 ) , and ( 2 ) a double subducted ridge system associated with a relictic slab - window was suggested for the West Junggar during the Late Carboniferous - Early Permian ( e . g . , Yin et al . , 2010Yin et al . , , 2013Yin et al . , , 2015 .
Amphibole compositions have also been used as an oxybarometer , based on an empirical relationship between magmatic fO 2 and a Mg index ( Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) .
Copper therefore appears to behave mildly compatibly for the majority of samples analyzed from arcs and ridges , indicating the continual presence of
oceanic crust , and are associated with few magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits .
Large amounts sulfide ( and contained metals ) might be lost if the lower crust is reduced ( e . g . , graphitic ) , but lesser amounts are expected during interaction with normal crustal rocks .
Cr - rich spinels have lower Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios than magnetite ( due to substitution of Ti 4 + and Cr 3 + for Fe 3 + ; Waychunas , 1991 ; Stamper et al . , 2014b ) , and their crystallization would therefore tend to cause an increase of the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratio in moderately oxidized primitive to intermediate composition magmas ( i . e . , oxidation ) rather than a decrease .
Hydrothermal fluids exsolved from these magmas will have similarly high oxidation states , approximately corresponding to the sulfur gas ( SO 2 - H 2 S ) buffer curve ( ~ FMQ = + 2 ; Fig . 7 ; Ohmoto and Rye , 1979 ; Ohmoto , 1986 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
of porphyry deposits in primitive island arcs , and the late appearance of large porphyry deposits within magmatic cycles in many continental arcs .
In combination sulfur fugacity of magmatic systems plays a critical role in the behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals .
These magmas are also characteristically depleted Ti , Ta , and Nb due to their low mobility in slab fluids and / or retention in restite phases ( Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Foley et al . , 2000 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Thus , typical arc magmas might be expected to become more reduced with magnetite crystallization .
While all volcanic arcs feature hydrothermal systems , large mineral deposits tend to form in clusters or age - related belts within these arcs , or as isolated deposits in back - arc settings .
other hand , segregation of sulfide melts and minerals will strongly partition chalcophile and siderophile elements , and if large volumes of sulfide are fractionated they will strongly deplete the magma in these metals ( potentially forming orthomagmatic sulfide deposits within mafic cumulate rocks ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The onset of magnetite fractionation in relatively evolved magmas ( ≥60 wt . %
occurs between dissolved sulfide and sulfate dominance in silicate melts at FMQ ≈ + 1 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Nilsson and Peach , 1993 ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , with high concentrations S ( dissolved as SO 4 2 - ) possible in more oxidized magmas ( e . g . , up to 1 . 5 wt . % S ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Beermann et al . , 2011 ) .
Although these metals can all be characterized as chalcophile and siderophile in character , Au and the PGE are considered to be highly siderophile , and partition strongly into most sulfide phases relative to silicate melts ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ) , while the PGE also partition differentially into metal alloy phases ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
Consequently , chalcophile and siderophile elements will behave incompatibly ( where residual sulfides are absent ) or weakly compatibly ( where sulfide abundances are low ) , and will tend to partition into the silicate melt , whose sulfur load will be dominantly in the form of sulfate .
large volumes of sulfide ( > ~ 1 % ) would need to unmix or crystallize from the magma before a significant proportion of the dissolved Cu could be extracted .
Assuming that these high - Cu values do reflect magmatic compositions , the reason for this incompatible behavior is not clear , but could be due either to low total sulfur fugacity ( unlikely in most arc settings ) or unusually high oxidation states , such that sulfide solubility was not exceeded or sulfides were destabilized by oxidation ( e . g . , Ballhaus et al . , 1991 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As discussed above , reduction will result in voluminous sulfide saturation and loss of potential to form later magmatic hydrothermal ore deposits ; this may explain the dearth of porphyry deposits in , for example , Japan , where the lower crust contains graphitic lithologies ( Sato , 2012 ; Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) .
Global data for measured Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ratios and Cu contents in unaltered volcanic and intrusive arc rocks indicate that , on average , they are slightly more oxidized than other magmas derived from depleted upper mantle ( such as MORB ) , but contain similar Cu contents across their compositional ranges .
It could be argued that the sulfides have been redissolved prior to final crystallization , and that the evidence has therefore been lost ( e . g . , Larocque et al . , 2000 ) , but one might still expect to see abundant sulfide inclusions trapped in and protected by phenocrysts if this process was important , whereas these inclusions are in fact sparse .
It also does not correlate with Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios in the rocks , and both relatively oxidized and relatively reduced rocks can have high Cu contents , although this is not common in either case .
The resulting primary magmas are hydrous , tholeiitic , high - Mg basalts ( Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) , which evolve to calc - alkaline compositions by early fractionation of olivine , clinopyroxene , and magnetite , and later crystallization of hornblende and plagioclase ( Grove and Kinzler , 1986 ; Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ) .
However , this modest increase in oxidation state is sufficient to shift the balance between dissolved sulfide and sulfate components in the melt towards more soluble sulfates , allowing the magmas to dissolve much larger amounts of sulfur than reduced magmas .
Several authors have suggested that late - stage sulfide saturation prior to volatile exsolution in the upper crust might be an important preconcentration step , by first partitioning chalcophile and siderophile metals into a sulfide melt or crystalline phase .
These hydrous compositions predispose arc magmas to developing - adakite - like‖ trace element signatures of Sr enrichment and heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) depletion , through early and abundant crystallization of pyroxene and hornblende ( which preferentially partition middle ( MREE ) and HREE ) , and late crystallization of plagioclase ( which would otherwise deplete the melt in Sr ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ;
In addition to promoting plutonism , the thickening of arc crust has multiple chemical effects on arc magmatism , including extending the range of magmatic differentiation and interaction with older crustal materials .
Relatively few suites of geochemical data for arc rocks include direct estimations of oxidation state , but where separate chemical analyses of FeO have been made , the Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ratio can be used as a proxy .
In particular , the presence of small amounts of Pt - Fe alloy as restite in the mantle source region may have a profound effect on PGE abundances and ratios in partial melts ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
Finally , the nature of the restite or fractionating sulfide or alloy phase also has a significant effect on metal partitioning .
Few data exist for concentrations of other metals such as Au and PGE in arc cumulates and magmas , but the higher partition coefficients of these elements between sulfide phases and silicate melts suggest that evolved arc magmas might indeed be relatively depleted , consistent with the relatively low abundances of Au and particularly PGE in many porphyry Cu deposits , and the occurrence of PGEs in Alaskan - type layered intrusions ( e . g . , Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Batanova et al . , 2005 ; Thakurta et al . , 2014 ) .
rocks under sulfur - undersaturated conditions , leading to redissolution sulfides and their metals , and the potential formation of post - subduction porphyry Cu ± Au deposits .
The distribution of data shown in Figures 4 and 5 suggests that Cu contents in mafic to intermediate magmas from both arc and ridge tectonic settings are similar and generally quite low ( < 200 ppm , similar to values obtained by Lee et al . , 2012 , in mantle melting models ) .
However , petrogenetic and geochemical considerations suggest that slab melting only occurs in exceptional circumstances in Phanerozoic arcs , such as the subduction of young , hot oceanic lithosphere , or at slab windows or tears where hot asthenosphere directly contacts subducted oceanic crust ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock et , 1994 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
Fractionation of mafic and largely anhydrous minerals also enriches the melt in incompatible and 3 ) .
Using the same dataset as for Figures 2 and 3 There is a broader scatter to higher Cu contents in tholeiitic and island arc rocks in the range 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ( which corresponds to the peak in Cu concentration ) compared with mature arcs ( Fig . 5 ; mature arc : mean = 59 . 9 ± 42 . 6 , median = 46 . 9 ppm , n = 1247 ; island arc : mean = 94 . 0 ± 58 . 9 ppm , median = 85 . 0 ppm , n = 372 ; tholeiite : mean = 117 . 5 ± 64 . 2 ppm , median = 110 . 0 ppm , n = 115 ) .
This timeframe is consistent with the relatively late timing of porphyry systems in island arc settings and in continental arc magmatic cycles ( Mitchell and Bell , 1973 ; Kesler et al . , 1977 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ) .
to achieve a steady state condition of 1 or 2 log fO 2 units above background depleted mantle values ( e . g . , up to FMQ ≈ + 1 ) .
Unfortunately , because of the difficulty and expense of obtaining accurate trace - level analyses of Au and PGE in igneous rocks , there is very little information on their abundance in arc rocks ( certainly compared to the wealth of data for Cu ) .
This crystallization sequence not only results in early Fe - depletion relative to alkalis , but can also generate high Sr / Y and HREE - depleted compositions ( high La / Yb , low Yb and Y concentrations ) that resemble adakites ( Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ; Takahashi et al . , 2005 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) suggest that primary magmatic water contents of 2 wt . % separate the - dry‖ tholeiitic olivine - plagioclase - orthopyroxene fractionation trend from the - wet‖ calc - alkaline trend , which is consistent with estimates of water contents in primary and primitive arc magmas of between 1 and 8 wt . % H 2 O ( typically 2 - 6 wt . % ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Carmichael , 2002 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Cervantes and Wallace , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Ruscitto et al . , 2012 ; Plank et al . , 2013 ; Edmonds et al . , 2014 ; Kimura and Ariskin , 2014 ) .
Their effects on metallogenic potential depend largely on whether they cause substantial loss of metals from the magma to crystallizing phases , prior to ascent into the upper crust and partitioning of those metals into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid ( Spooner , 1993 ) .
The Sanjiang region in SE Tibet Plateau , and the western Yunnan region in southwestern China constitute a collage Gondwana - derived micro - continental blocks and arc terranes that were accreted together after the closure of the Paleotethys Oceans in Permo - Triassic .
The pattern of primitive mantle - normalized trace elements exhibits pronounced negative anomalies Ti , and P , typically indicative of subduction - related magmatism ( Roger et al . , 2000 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ( Roger et al . , 2000 ; Spurlin et al . , 2005 ) .
Early volcanism during the Pliocene or Miocene occurred in southeast and northern margins of the Tengchong volcanic area ( Zhu et al . , 1983 ) , it migrated to the central part of the field during the Pleistocene to Holocene ( Huangpu and Jiang , 2000 ) .
Sulfide δ 34 S values of Jinman show a wide range and a peak around 0 .
Microthermometric measurements on these fluid inclusions show that the ore fluid was characterized by medium temperature the leucogranite was generally derived from a shallower level in the crust compared to the regional amphibolite .
The Sanjiang ( Three Rivers ) region is named due to it is drained by three major rivers : the Jinshajiang , Lancangjiang and Nujiang .
The potassic and ultrapotassic intrusive felsic rocks in the central and southern segments share similar ages , and they intruded in a limited time around 35 Ma ( Lu et al . , 2012 ) , which is younger than those in the northern segment .
The mechanism for magma generation has also remained controversial , and various models have been proposed : ( 1 ) Eastward India continental subduction leading to fluid infiltration into the overlying mantle wedge and subsequent melting ( Wang et al . , 2001a ) ( Fig . 6a ) .
The Lailishan ore deposit is temporally and spatially associated with S - type granite ( Liu et al . , 1993 ) .
The concentrations of 4 He trapped in fluid inclusions of pyrites from the ores from the Yulong , Beiya , Machangqing , and Yao ' an ore deposits are ( 0 . 7 - ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 52 54 . 1 ) ×10 - 6 cm 3 STP g - 1 , and those of 40 Ar are ( 0 . 6 - 7 . 3 ) ×10 - 6 cm 3 STP g - 1 , 3 He / 4 He ratios are 0 . 3 - 2 . 5 Ra , 40 Ar / 36 Ar ratios are 316 - 1736 , and 3 He / 36 Ar ratios are 0 . 2 - 11 . 2×10 - 3 ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) .

The Cenozoic tectonic deformation , as well as the magmatic and metallogenic processes , in the Sanjiang region have been extensively researched in the past decades .
The Gonglang , Manghao , and Huguangzai granodiorites in the Cangyuan area show zircon SHRIMP U - Pb ages of 40 . 9 to 40 Ma ( Yu et al . , 2008 ) , and the Laochang granodiorites display zircon LA - ICP - MS U - Pb ages of 43 . 41 to 45 Ma ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) .
The metasomatism beneath the western Yangtze Craton was related to the slab subduction in response to the formation of the Panxi - Hannan arc around 1100 - 900 Ma ( Fig . 6e ) ( Zhou et al . , 2002 ( Zhou et al . , , 2006Lu et al . , 2013aLu et al . , , 2013b ) .
The Lailishan granite is characterized by high K , F , and S contents , and elevated initial 87 Sr / 87 Sr ratio ( 0 . 7124 - 0 . 7138 ) , suggesting a crustal anatexis ( Lu and Wang , 1993 ) .
This preliminary metal enrichment was possibly favoured by the presence of a thickened crust ( Chiaradia , 2014 ) .
The local and transient extension in a broadly compressional regime supports the notion that the potassic - ultrapotassic igneous rocks were formed in the background of asthenosphere upwelling following the removal of lower lithospheric mantle ( Fig . 10c ) .
The re - oriented Sanjiang , as well as SE Aisa , still persisted a slow clockwise rotation , resulting in the formation of several NE - trending strike - slip faults in the Indochina and Sibumasu blocks .
These Tengchong mafic dykes have highly radiogenic initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ranging from 0 . 7065 to 0 . 7139 and εNd ( t ) from - 0 . 3 to - 3 . 9 ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) .

( ii ) Breakoff of Neotethyan slab in 45 –40 Ma in combination with the India - Eurasia continental hard collision caused the diachronous removal of the lower lithospheric mantle during 3 42 –32 Ma , with the resultant potassic - ultrapotassic magmatism and formation of the related porphyry - skarn ore deposits along the Jinshajiang - Ailaoshan suture .
As the India continent exerted northeastward compression on the northwestern segment of the Tethyan orogenic extending from Tibet to Sanjiang , the South China block pushed the southeastern segment in the opposite direction due to the lithosphere underthrusting .
Numerous ore deposits porphyry Cu - , Au - , and Mo - , Mississippi valley type ( MVT ) Pb - Zn , and orogenic Au , were formed in Cenozoic , making the Sanjiang one of the most productive and potential for metal resources in China .
12 ) The Beiya ore deposit , the largest porphyry - skarn Au deposit in China , has a gold reserve of > 200 tons according to the exploration carried out in 2012 ( Fig . 5 ; Yang and Lü , 2011 ; He et al . , 2013b ) .
18 Ma , the underthrust lithosphere rolled back , released alkali elements and metasomatized the overriding mantle , producing the second episode of potassic - ultrapotassic magmatism ( Fig . 10f ) .
According to geophysical data , the NE - directed subduction of the Indian slab had a high angle ( Fig . 3 ; Lei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2008a ) .
The source for the metasomatic agent is in debate .
This suggests that crustal rifting occurred around the thickened block margins where potassic - ultrapotassic porphyries were generated .
It is proposed that the kinking in the Sanjiang region was controlled by the non - coaxial compressions India continent , which are much larger in size than the blocks in Sanjiang .
It was proposed that these OIB - like magmas were induced by the interplay between the India - Eurasia collision and subduction of the Pacific plate , resulted in a Late Cenozoic tensile setting in East Asia , which was capable of inducing melting in the asthenosphere by decompression ( Hoàng et al . , 2013 ) .
This suggests a small amount mantle - derived Pb might have been involved into the ore formation ( Fig . 7 ) .
Since the regional widespread lamprophyres that are considered to be derived directly from the metasomatized mantle display low metal concentrations , we infer that most of the Cu metals was sourced from the juvenile lower crust , where metal enrichment occurred during the Proterozoic or Paleozoic subduction processes .
The most important among these ore deposits is the Jinding Zn - Pb deposit ( No .
However , the linkage between the tectonic , magmatic , and metallogenic aspects and the control of pre - Cenozoic lithosphere architecture on the Cenozoic evolution have not been well addressed .
Correspondingly , we consider that the ore metals and fluid in the Zhenyuan were sourced in a shallower level than those in the Daping .
Data sources for different genetic types of deposits : Magmatic hydrothermal deposit in the Lanping basin ( Wu et al . , 2003 ; Xu and Zhou , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Song , 2009 ) ; Jinding MVT Pb - Zn deposit ( Bai et al . , 1985 ; Ye et al . , 1992 ; Zhou and Zhou , 1992 1993 ; Xiu et al . , 2006 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2011a ) and other MVT deposits in the Lanping basin ( Zhang , 1993 ; Wei , 2001 ; Wang and He , 2003 ; Xu and Zhou , 2004 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Zhao , 2006 ; Song , 2009 ) ; Zhenyuan ( Hu et al . , 1995 ; Dong et al . , 1997 ) and Daping ( Han et al . , 1997 ; Chang and Zhu , 2005 ; Yuan et al . , 2010 ) orogenic Au deposits within the Ailaoshan - Red River shear zone .

Based on ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT P a g e | 32 their location above the subducting Neotethyan slab , we infer that these rocks are products of back - arc extension .
In this paper , we synthesize the information from various aspects to build a coherent picture for the Cenozoic tectonomagmatic and metallogenic evolution of the Sanjiang region .
Gold and arsenic incorporation into pyrite is strongly coupled in pyrite from many 3 different types of ore deposits , including Carlin - type Au ( e . g . , Cline , 2001 ; Emsbo et al . , 2003 ; Reich et al . , 2005 ; Muntean et al . , 2011 ) , porphyry Cu , Cu - Au , and epithermal Au ( e . g . , Cook and Chryssouliss , 1990 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) , orogenic Au ( e . g . , Morey et al . , 2008 ; Large et al . , 2007 ) , volcanogenic massive sulphide ( VHMS ) deposits ( Frimmel et al . , 2005 ; Agangi et al . , 2013 ) .
The differences in the distribution of the analytical data between Carlin - type deposits ( Fig . 6 ) in Au - As space probably reflect the different conditions and thus processes that were responsible for the formation of Au - bearing NPs in pyrite , and evolution of pyrite composition under changing physico - chemical conditions .
Gold in pyrite from porphyry Cu deposits seems to be distributed relatively homogeneously with no detectable zoning .
Most of the trace elements in pyrite in epithermal Au deposits are located in growth and sector zones , often in alternating zones that are indicative of surface ( kinetic ) or crystal - chemically ( equilibrium ) growth during metal deposition , respectively ( Chouinard et al . , 2005a ; Deditius et al . , 2009a ) .
The higher concentrations of Au in pyrite noted for some of the high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits may also reflect their relatively oxidizing conditions of formation when compared with low - sulfidation systems , which could favour formation of Au3 + and As2 As2 + species might be present in the pyrite structure ( Chouinard et al . , 2005a and b ; Simmons et al . , 2005 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ) .
The content of Au in pyrite from submarine hydrothermal vents , which are modern analogues of the VMS deposits , tends to increase with increasing distance from the central part of the hydrothermal chimney , a relation that has been interpreted to reflect a decrease in the temperature gradient from ~ 450 oC down to ~ 80 oC ( Maslennikov et al . , 2009 ) .
The high concentrations of Au measured in brine fluid inclusions match the highest amounts of Au measured in pyrite from the Ok - Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Table 3 ) and in pyrite from Dexing porphyry Cu porphyry deposit ( Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
In orogenic Au deposits at least part of the pyrite grains were affected by dissolution and / or reprecipitation upon interaction with hydrothermal fluids delivering Au , and causing chemical redistribution of the data in Au - As space ( Fig . 6b ) .
In Au - As space , the process of Au - As incorporation into pyrite from an ore fluid will proceed diagonally under isothermal equilibrium ( Fig . 11 ) .
5 . 1 Carlin - type deposits Pyrite analyses from Carlin - type deposits form a wedge - shaped zone with most analyses plotting below an Au : As ratio of 1 : 100 ( Fig . 5a ) .
5 . 5 Retrograde solid solubility of As in arsenian pyrite Gold - arsenic relations not only help constrain the chemical limits of these two elements in pyrites from various types of ore deposits , but also provide key information on the approximate temperature controls on Au incorporation into arsenian pyrite .
These As - rich nanozones are likely to recrystallize under higher temperature conditions facilitating Au migration .
Existing Au - As data of pyrite from VHMS deposits , although limited , allow some conclusions about the behaviour of As and Au in hydrothermal systems .
While the wedge - shape zone ( 1 ) breaches the solubility limit of Au for Carlin - type deposits ( red line in Figure 6a ) , the wedge - shape zone ( 2 ) plots entirely below the solubility limit .
By analogy the As - rich nanozones in pyrite may be responsible for the relatively uniform size of Au NPs in Carlin - type and epithermal deposits ; i . e . , < 50 nm ( Reich et al . , 2006 ; Deditius et 34 al . , 2011 ) .
In contrast , fluid inclusions in quartz from the 20 Chinese Shuiyindong and Yata Carlin - style are larger , ( ~ 20 μm ) , and of aqueous - carbonic and carbonic composition ( Su et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the fine - grained , porous and irregular nature of arsenian pyrite textures in Carlin - type deposits ( Palenik et al . , 2004 ) suggests that efficient scavenging of Au from solution is dominated by the kinetics of pyrite precipitation rather than high - T equilibrium partitioning , as discussed below .
This leads to pyrite / vapour partition coefficients of ~ 0 . 35 for Au and pyrite / brine coefficients of ~ 0 . 13 .
The amounts of As ( 0 . 6 - 1 . 3 ppm ) in liquid + vapour type fluid inclusions are lower and / or equal , to the measured amounts in pyrite , i . e . , 0 . 8 - 2 . 3 ppm of As .
The analyses for pyrite with Au nanoparticles from Bathrust ( yellow circles in Figure 6b , and black dashed circles in Figure 8 ) plot below the solubility limit of Au and within the same range of Au concentrations as the analyses of As - pyrite with Au nanoparticles reported at Sunrise Dam by Sung et al . ( 2009 ) .
In these systems , Au - bearing , coarse pyrite precipitated from hydrothermal fluids , and its trace - elements composition was modified under high - temperature conditions ( 300 - 400 oC ) , with at least partial re - equilibration with Au - bearing fluids ( e . g . , Mumin et al . 1994 ; McClenaghan et al . , 2004 ; Morey et al . 2008 ; Sung et al . , 2009 ) .
( c ) Comparison of wedgeshaped zones for pyrite from Carlin - type and orogenic deposits .
This work shows that the coupled geochemistry of Au and As in pyrite is a ubiquitous phenomenon in wide range of hydrothermal and diagenetic environments .
It was documented that amorphous NPs of As - Fe - S ( i . e . , melt ) were formed at about ~ 320 oC , in pyrite from the high - sulfidation , epithermal Pueblo Viejo deposit ( Deditius et al . , 2009b ) .
Examples can be found in porphyry , high - sulfidation epithermal , and Carlin - type deposits where at least part of As and Au were deposited contemporaneously in pyrite ( Barker et al . , 2009 ; Deditius et al . , 2008 ; Deditius et al . 2009a ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) , and in some cases formed As - Au - bearing metallic NPs ( Deditius et al . , 2011 ) .
These values suggest that Au and As are preferentially concentrated in the ore fluid relative to pyrite .
In contrast , reduction of Au + to Au0 will be favoured when this metal is delivered as Au - Cl complexes to the surface of pyrite and other sulfides ( e . g . , Hyland and Bancroft , 1989 ; Eggleston and Hochella , 1991 ) .
In addition , we explore the mineralogical and geochemical factors controlling Au and As speciation in pyrite , while discussing the extent to which its Au - As composition preserves the Au / As signature of parent fluids .
This explains the presence of nanoparticulate Au at lower Au / As ratios than in systems where metamorphic perturbations are absent Our results indicate that the coupled geochemistry of Au and As in pyrite in ore deposits is defined by two major trends that obey the solubility limit ( Reich et al . , 2005 ) : ( i ) pyrite from Carlin - type and orogenic deposits , displaying wedged - shaped zones where pyrite geochemistry is largely controlled by fluid - rock interactions ( e . g . , sulfidation of wall - rock ) ; and ( ii ) pyrite from porphyry - to - epithermal deposits whose composition registers and preserves the Au / As signature of ore fluids .
5 . 4 Additional insights into pyrite geochemistry from other types of ore deposits Additional insights into the behavior of Au and As in pyrite as a function of temperature can be gained from published data from VHMS deposits ( Fig . 8 ) .
Figure 6b displays the impact of Au remobilization on Au - As concentrations in pyrite from 24 the Golden Ridge deposit , described by Morey et al . ( 2008 ) , upon alteration Au by a hydrothermal fluid .
At lower temperatures ( ~ 100 oC ) the content of Au reaches unrealistic values of 3500 ppm .
Most of the discussion will refer to Carlin - type Au , orogenic Au , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au , and epithermal Au deposits .
No significant changes were noticed in As concentration in fluid inclusions through the paragenesis in spite of precipitation of arsenopyrite at the latest stage of As - pyrite formation ( Su et al . , 2012 ) .
Note that the wedge - shaped zone ( 2 ) of the orogenic deposits is almost completely overlapped by the one representing pyrite from Carlin - type deposits .
Figure 7c clearly demonstrates an increase in the concentrations of Au and As in pyrite during the transition from porphyry to epithermal environments .
A similar interpretation was proposed for the porous Cu - rich zones observed in pyrite from Pueblo Viejo deposit , where authors suggested rapid kinetically - controlled deposition of Cu - Fe - S NPs plus porosity development , probably during boiling of the hydrothermal fluid ( Deditius et al . , 2011a and b ) .
These observations confirm the high capacity of arsenian pyrite to incorporate Au from hydrothermal fluids .
This phenomenon may be particularly important for pyrite grains that contain micro - and nanoparticulate sulfosalts ( Tomkins et al . , 2007 ) , as reported for pyrite from epithermal deposits ( Deditius et al . , 2011a ) .
Reich et al . ( 2005 ) showed that the maximum amount of Au that can be incorporated into pyrite is mainly a function of As concentration .
Such an inverse relationship between the amount of incorporated Au and the size of As - pyrite crystals was observed in pyrite that hosts anionic ( Simon et al . , 1999b ) and cationic species of As .
Here we explore these constraints using new and previously published EMPA , LA - ICP - MS , SIMS , and μ - PIXE analyses of As and Au in pyrite from Carlin - type Au , epithermal Au , porphyry Cu , Cu - Au , and orogenic Au deposits , volcanogenic massive sulfide ( VHMS ) , Witwatersrand Au , iron oxide copper gold deposits .
This suggests a mechanism characterized by simultaneous precipitation of pyrite and incorporation of Au .
Deditius et al . ( 2009a ) and more recently Reich et al . ( 2013 ) have proposed that Au - As - Cu compositional features in pyrite may reflect periodic changes in hydrothermal fluid compositions that are recorded in complex zoning during epithermal Au and porphyry Cu mineralization .
In this study we evaluate the role of these factors using new and previously published SIMS , LA - ICP - MS , EMPA , and μ - PIXE analyses of pyrite from Carlin - type Au , epithermal Au , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au , orogenic Au , VHMS , IOCG , Witwatersrand Au , active hydrothermal vents in submarine environments , and coal deposits .
Reich et al . ( 2005 ) reviewed XANES and EXAFS data showing that both Au + and Au0 were present in fine - grained pyrite as shown in Figure 5a .
Note the wedge - shaped zone ( grey solid line ) , which hosts most of the analyses that plot along the orange arrow marking a positive correlation between Au and As .
Cu is incompatible in most of the common silicate phases ( Le Roux et al . , 2015 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ; Reekie et al . , 2019 ) .
Continental arc magmas become Cu - depleted while most island arcs become Cu - enriched .
Sulfide solubility increases with FeO content , thus Fe - depleting magmatic series should deplete in Cu , consistent with the low Cu contents of continental arc magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Garnet driven oxidation provides a simple explanation for why Fe depletion ( and Cu depletion ) and oxidation typify continental arc magmas , but rarely island arcs and never mid - ocean ridge settings .
High Sr / Y ratios reflect garnet fractionation owing to the compatible behavior of Yb and Y in garnet while high initial Sr reflects increasing crustal contamination .
Thermal incubation by the passage of magmas elevates geotherms , while erosion ( enhanced by the high elevations ) , causes further shallowing of the BDT .
Extension - driven decompression of the lower crust might be the only mechanism by which arclogites can be significantly re - melted ( Richards , 2009 ) , but when continental arcs approach their maximum thickness , they are generally being tectonically thickened rather than thinned ( Haschke and Gunther , 2003 ; Jiang et al . , 2015 ; Kay and Mpodozis , 2001 ) .
Fe depletion facilitates sulﬁde segregation , which in turn se - questers most of the magma’s Cu into the lower crust .
An increase in Tb / Yb and Sr / Y suggests that the average pressures of magmatic differentiation must be increasing , which has been shown to also indicate increasing thickness of the arc crust ( Chapman et al . , 2015 ; Chiaradia , 2015 ; Farner and Lee , 2017 ) .
The release of large amounts of fluids may be key to developing porphyritic textures as fluids enhance crystal growth rates ( Nabelek et al . , 2010 ) .
The chalcophile element depleted in the melt before sulfide exhaustion , but after sulfide exhaustion , the chalcophile element behaves perfectly incompatibly .
Are continental arc magmas more volatile - rich to begin with than island arc magmas , and if so , why ?
This divergence in the behavior of Fe is important to understanding Cu ' s behavior .
Before sulfide saturation , the chalcophile element concentration in melt increases like an incompatible element .
Because arclogite garnets are enriched in FeO but low ferric iron proportion ( Fe 3 + / Fe < 0 . 1 ) , fractionation of garnet results in depletion in total iron ( FeO * ) but increasing oxidation of residual iron ( Tang et al . , 2018 ; Tang et al . , 2019b ) .
Like most ore deposits , porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) are rare , but they exhibit spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and * Corresponding author .
Here , the arc crust is thick ( > 45 km ) .
Because the crust extension , heat flow is high and geotherms are advected upwards , resulting in a shallow brittle ductile transition ( BDT ) .
Evolution of magma emplacement depths with arc maturation
Combination of stress state and shallow BDT causes residence time of magmas in the crust to be low and allows magmas breach the surface and erupt .
In contrast , in differentiation driven scenarios , parental magmas need not be enriched in Cu , but widespread scavenging shallow level plutons followed by efficient trapping and concentration of the mobilized Cu into a localized reservoir ( ore ) is required ( Henley et al . , 2015 ; Kay and Mpodozis , 2001 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
They rep - resent shallow level intrusives ( 2–5 km ) ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , not too shallow that they erupt and not too deep that they do not de - gas ( Fig . 1 ) .
As large amounts of fluids are needed to scavenge Cu from such large volumes of plutons , high volatile contents are needed , but how much and from where such volatiles derive is an open question .
However , subsequent escape of fluids to the surrounding country rock would increase the solidus of the magma , causing freezing , rapid nucleation and the formation of a fine - grained groundmass .
Here , we show that the formation PCDs requires a complex sequence of intra - crustal magmatic processes , from the lower crust to the upper crust .
Rearward migration of the arc from the trench eventually culminated in cessation in magmatism , followed by a ∼ 10 My amagmatic gap between the two magmatic segments .
Much of the world ' s economic copper resources are hosted in porphyry copper deposits ( PCDs ) , shallow level magmatic intrusions associated mostly with thick ( > 45 km ) magmatic arcs , such as mature island arcs and continental arcs .
Although rearward migration of the arc front is often attributed to a decrease in the angle of subduction ( e . g . , shallowing dip ; Haschke et al . , 2006 ) , a simpler explanation is that progressive thickening of the arc crust by magmatic inflation / underplating and tectonic shortening gradually forces the hot part of the mantle wedge to migrate away from the trench ( Dickinson , 1973 ; Karlstrom et al . , 2014 ) .
Our hypothesis allows us to predict when ores are most likely to form during the evolution of an arc : the greatest oxidizing power and propensity for scavenging Cu occurs when garnet crystallize .
We note that some studies have suggested that high Sr / Y in island arcs , while rare , may very well be explained by the formation of deep - seated cumulates ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) .
How and when is the fracture network generated within the pluton ?
Finally , although our model can explain the correlation of PCDs in continental arcs with the development of thick arc crust , PCDs do exist in some island arcs , such as the Philippines , Papua New Guinea , Panama and accreted island arc terranes in British Columbia , central Asia and eastern Australia ( Sinclair , 2007 ) .
These questions are similar to those being asked of how large volumes of crystal - poor silicic magmas can be extracted from a crystal mush and erupt ( Bachmann and Bergantz , 2004 ) .
( Lee et al . , 2006 ( Lee et al . , , 2012 and in western Arizona ( Chin et al . , 2018 ; Erdman et al . , 2016 ) compared to Cretaceous continental arc plutonic rock compositions ( as represented by the Peninsular Ranges batholith in southern California Lee et al . , 2007 ) .
Mass changes are generally more pronounced in the acid - sulfate altered rocks compared to the near - neutral pH altered rocks .
The pH - dependence of the geochemical behavior of Rb in hydrothermal conditions was utilized to construct new molar element ratios that could differentiate the rocks that underwent K - metasomatism either under near - neutral pH conditions .
Magnesium of the dioritic rocks at the Christine prospect notably decreased as no chlorite or smectite was observed in the samples .
High Cu Journal Pre - proof concentrations of the samples can be due to the formation of either chalcopyrite , bornite and covellite , while the Pb can be fixed as galena , and Sb is incorporated in tetrahedrite - tennantite solid solution .
The Rb concentration of the hypersaline polyphase fluid inclusions in pyrite range from 300 to 500 ppm , while that of the vapor inclusions in the same pyrite is up to 10 ppm ( Kouzmanov et al . 2010 ) .
The dioritic rocks of the Christine prospect that has been pervasively altered to sericite gained 1 . 7 wt % K , while the dioritic rocks of the Fatima deposit , which have been pervasively altered to alunite also gained an average of 1 . 7 wt % K . The lower K gain ( 0 . 5 wt % K ) of the dioritic rocks at the FSE deposit may be attributed to a lower degree of sericitic alteration .
Mineralization occurs as gold - rich bornite or bornite - chalcopyrite dissemination and 21 We also looked at the geochemistry of the middle Miocene rhyolitic to rhyodacitic rocks of the Şaphane alunite deposit in western Anatolia , Turkey ( Mutlu et al . 2005 ) .
Spider diagrams show the effect of hydrothermal alteration on the abundance of REEs .
Zirconium relatively immobile during the hydrothermal alteration .
The altered rocks from FSE and Christine took also S from the fluids , exhibited by the formation of disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrite .
The different alteration types in the Hugo Dummet deposits can also be differentiated by the ( K + Rb ) / Al versus ( 2Ca + Na + K ) / Al diagram ( Fig . 13B ) , which is similar to the trend of the altered host rocks in the Mankayan District .
The dioritic rocks affected by acid - sulfate alteration in the Mankayan District lost Rb as much as 100 ppm , indicating that Rb was extracted by the fluids and were transported out of the system .
The granitoids and the basaltic to dacitic volcanic rocks of the Hugo Dummet deposit that were altered under near - neutral pH conditions plots proximal to the dioritic rocks of the FSE , Honeycomb deposits .
The hydrothermal fluids taken from geothermal wells and hot springs in Valles Caldera , New Mexico , Journal Pre - proof USA vary from neutral chloride fluids to acid - sulfate springs ( Michard 1989 ) .
The undulatory pattern in the losses from Lu ( Fig . 11A to D ) indicates that the elements with even atomic number are leached from 25 Journal Pre - proof the rock at a higher degree than the elements with odd atomic number .
In the Questa porphyry deposit , New Mexico USA , Klemm et al . ( 2008 ) measured the Rb concentration of the fluid inclusions in the quartz of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia with potassic alteration .
Based on laser ablation – inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA - ICPMS ) of fluid inclusions conducted by other authors on other deposits ( e . g .
The maximum Ce , Nd concentrations of neutral - chloride fluids with pH 7 are 70 parts per trillion ( ppt ) , 25 ppt and 2 . 8 ppt , respectively ( Michard 1989 ) .
However , at very low concentrations of K ( < 0 . 02 mol ) , K and Rb contents are proportional in some acid - sulfate altered rocks .
Surrounding the intrusive rocks are augite basalt and dacitic ash - flow tuff that were altered to advanced argillic assemblage variably composed of andalusite , corundum , woodhouseite , diaspore , alunite , zunyite , pyrophyllite and topaz ( Khashgerel et al . 2008 ) .
However , since alunite contain more K than Na , and there is little disseminated pyrite in the samples of the dioritic and metavolcanic rocks from Carmen , Florence and Fatima , the over - all concentration of Na and Fe decreased .
In contrast , the depletion of La and Ce by near - neutral pH alteration may indicate that LREEs are transferred to the resulting fluid and were not incorporated into the crystals of the secondary minerals .
They concluded that Rb concentration increases twice to thrice than the original concentration after the 18 Journal Pre - proof precursor rocks were affected by potassic or sericitic alteration ( Armbrust et al . 1977 ) .
Looking at the likely initial concentration of the hydrothermal fluids , we refer to Michard ( 1989 ) who reported the concentrations of Ce , Nd , Sm , Eu , Gd , Dy , Er and Yb of the hydrothermal solutions in different geothermal fields .
The non - mineralized Lepanto Metavolcanics and Imbanguila Dacite show flat REE pattern ( Fig . 3 ) , while the other hydrothermally - altered metavolcanic rocks and diorite porphyry show depletion in REEs ( Figs . 4 and 23 Journal Pre - proof 5 ) .
Journal Pre - proof 7 . 3 Behavior of rare earth elements during alteration Although the concentration of rare earth elements in most hydrothermal systems are far below from being economic , their geochemical behavior can give insights in solving petrological and mineralogical problems in hydrothermal systems ( Henderson 1996 ; Giere 1996 ) .
Similar observations on the REE concentrations of the fluids in Dominica , Lesser Antilles were also reported ( Michard 1989 ) .
This is due to the originally higher more variable Rb content of rhyolitic rocks ( Armbrust et al . 1977 ) .
Nevertheless , the depletion of Rb with respect to K is still evident in the Rb versus K diagram ( Fig . 13A ) , indicating that Rb is not incorporated in alunite crystal lattice despite its geochemical similarities with K . The trends observed from the plutonic and volcanic rocks from the Mankayan District , Hugo Dummet , Şaphane deposits indicate that the variation from mafic to felsic compositions have little effect on the product of hydrothermal alteration .
Nevertheless , understanding the behavior elements is crucial because it provides clues to the conditions that led to the formation of ore deposits .
Furthermore , we also compared the geochemical data of the metavolcanic and dioritic rocks in the Carmen and Florence prospects hosting quartz - pyrite - gold and enargite veins which overprinted earlier porphyry - type mineralization .
Moreover , we found variability in the behavior of LREEs and HREEs in acidic hydrothermal environment .
This suggests that the significant difference in the concentration of K in the two types of hydrothermal fluids may have little 20 Journal Pre - proof to no effect on the addition of K that the precursor rocks take up during alteration .
Journal Pre - proof We utilized the difference in the chemical behavior of Rb to differentiate the host rocks in MER diagrams .
These observations are consistent with the behavior of the other LREEs such as La , Pr and Nd .
Porphyry Cu deposits are typically oxidized , but when and how porphyry magma gain their high oxygen fugacity signatures , and how oxygen fugacity controls porphyry mineralization , remains obscure .
Hydrothermal activities are the two major processes that enrich ore - forming elements .
The trace element compositions of oceanic slab ( Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) and lower crust ( Rudnick and Fountain , 1995 ) are used as initial values for modeling .
The Cu concentration of the magma source can be constructed as : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Where is the Cu partition coefficient between fluid and melt ; , and are the Cu concentration of magma source , primitive fluid and the equilibrium melt , respectively ; and are the proportion of primitive fluid and melt , respectively .
Three mineralized Dexing porphyries corresponding to three mines , Tongchang , Fujiawu and Zhushahong ( Fig . 1C ) , intruded into the Neoproterozoic Shuangqiaoshan Group phyllite rocks ( Wang et al . , 2013b ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) .
Although sediments play an important role in the arc magmatism ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Plank , 2005 ; Plank and Langmuir , 1998 ) , subducted sediments is not a major component in adakites derived from slab melting .
The special geochemical signature of porphyry magma ( like high La / Yb raitos ) makes it essential to reiterate melts ' compositions and behavior of sulfides at these fO 2 conditions .
The estimated oxygen fugacity reflected by zircons from Dexing porphyry Cu deposit indicates that the oxidized characteristics of porphyry magma are primary characteristics of the magmas parental to the porphyry Cu deposit .
This goes back to slab melting for Cu enrichment , anyway , which emphasizes the necessity of the subducted oceanic slab .
Although the origin of Cu mineralized porphyry magma is still in debate ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Richards , 2009Richards , , 2013Sun et al . , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , most parental magmas of porphyry possess high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which are also important characteristics for adakite and adakitic magmas .
To estimate the minimum Cu concentration in the magma source of the mineralized porphyry , the highest the partition coefficient and lowest fluid proportion are used .
In this scenario , 5 - 30 % partial melting of subducted slab under an oxygen fugacity higher than FMQ + 1 . 5 produces melts with high Sr / Y and La / Yb , features that are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
The partition coefficients of silicate minerals in the magma evolution process are average values from Liu et al . ( 2015 ) ( Table S5 ) .
It , therefore , was argued that normal arc rocks may form porphyry Cu deposits through addition of water ( Richards , 2011 ) .
Previous modeling results show that partial melting of mantle peridotite under high oxygen fugacity ( even at > ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) cannot form Cu - rich magmas , which plausibly explains the lack of porphyry 3 Cu deposits in normal arc rocks .
Previous studies also suggested that partial melting of mantle peridotite under different oxygen fugacities is not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
To form the Sr / Y and La / Yb signature of a porphyry system through melting of the lower continental crust , more than 40 % partial melting is needed .
This suggests that ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 is a threshold of porphyry deposit , which forms Cu rich magmas ( Fig . 7 ) .
In the accumulated fractional melting model of this study , the melt increment ( 0 . 01 % ) instantaneously extracts from the system and equilibrates with the mineral assemblage residues , then aggregates to form accumulated melts .
Hydrothermal alteration of the intrusions at Pulang includes five main types : K - silicate , epidote - chlorite , chlorite - illite , quartz - illite , and clay alteration .
Porphyry Cu - Au deposits typically have a spatial , temporal , and genetic association with dioritic to monzonitic intrusive rocks at convergent plate margins ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Grappe , 1984 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Wilson et al . , 2003 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Wolfe and Cooke , 2011 ; Bissig and Cooke , 2014 ) .
The giant Pulang porphyry Cu - Au district ( 446 . 8 million tonnes at 0 . 52 % Cu and 0 . 18 g / tonne Au ) is in the southern segment of the Yidun arc ( Zhongdian arc ) , part of the Sanjiang Tethyan orogenic belt in southwest China .
The Pulang intru - sive complex hosts three deposits ( South , East , and North Pulang ) and includes premineralization fine - grained quartz diorite and coarse - grained quartz diorite , intermineralization quartz monzonite , and late - mineralization diorite porphyry , which all formed ca .
However , the Pulang intrusions have undergone extensive hydrothermal alteration , and K - Ar / Ar - Ar isotope systems are susceptible to such alteration whereas zircon U - Pb isotope systems remain closed and yield more reliable ages for the porphyries .
However , at Pulang , epidote - chlorite alteration occurs both on the periphery and in the core of the deposit , and copper mineralization is mainly associated with epidote - chlorite alteration assemblages .
( B ) Geologic sketch map of the Zhongdian arc ( modified after Leng et al . , 2012 ) .
Both peripherally and centrally distributed epidote - chlorite altera - tion and related Cu mineralization in a porphyry Cu deposit ( e . g . , Pulang ) indicate either that there is another porphyry deposit nearby , fluids from which have overprinted epidote - chlorite alteration onto preexisting copper mineralization and K - silicate alteration at the deposit considered , or that epidote - chlorite–stable fluids collapsed into the K - silicate–altered core during waning hydrothermal activity .
No caus - ative quartz monzonite has been identified at East Pulang , where alteration and veins occur mainly in the coarse - grained quartz diorite .
The classic porphyry - style alteration zona - tion pattern of Lowell and Guilbert ( 1970 ) does not apply to Pulang , in which epidote - chlorite alteration extends from the deposit core outward and has strongly overprinted early K - silicate alteration .
The ore - related porphyries in the UDMA and Chagai belts show enrichment in LREE and depletion in HREE and Y , but display listric - shaped REE patterns ( Fig . 4c , d ) , and these ore - related porphyries have elevated chondrite - normalized Dy / Yb values ( Fig . 5a ) .
pre - mineralization epoch to Miocene mineralization epoch in both the UDMA and Eastern Gangdese belt could explain the phenomenon that the rocks formed before mineralization lacked porphyry Cu mineralization , whereas the Miocene adakite - like porphyries host some of the world’s largest Cu ore deposits .
All ore - related porphyries in both collisional and subduction belts , such as the UDMA , the Eastern Gangdese , and the magmatic Chagai belts were generated by calc - alkaline to shoshonitic intermediate - felsic magmas with adakite - like geochemical affinities .
We and low Ni ( 4 . 5 - 46 . 4 ppm ) , which is inconsistent with the compositional characteristics of melts from a mantle source ( Wang et al . , 2008 ; Xu et al . , 2010 ) .
A detailed Sr isotopic composition and Sr / Y ratio comparison between ore - related and ore - barren magma systems in these three separate segments of the Eastern Tethys indicates that a porphyry ore - related magma is dependent on the melt source and depth in the lower crust : especially during a magmatism flare - up stage .
However , the Kahang and Dalli deposits in the Central UDMA have slightly higher initial ( 87Sr / 86Sr ) i ( Kahang : 0 . 705849 - 0 . 706386 ; Dalli : 0 . 706489 - 0 . 707020 ) .
Therefore , the partial melting of a thickened mafic lower crust is a plausible mechanism for the generation of these ore - related porphyries in both the UDMA and the Chagai belt ( Hou et al . , 2013 ) .
In Figure 5b the ore - related porphyries in the UDMA and the Chagai belt have relatively higher Sr / Y values than those of the ore - barren rocks .
Accordingly , the added juvenile mantle would gradually decrease from the bottom of the lower crust to the pre - existing crust .
We suggest that the ore - related porphyries originated from underplated juvenile crust formed during their magmatic flare - up period .
In conjunction with the ore - related porphyries derived from thickened lower crust , it is thus more likely , from a geochemical perspective , that the two ore - related porphyries were also derived from thickened juvenile mafic crust .
Therefore , the relatively high Sr isotope ratios of these two deposits are inconsistent with shallow crustal assimilation of thick orogenic arc crust .
There is a general consensus that the ultimate sources of the metals in ore - related magmas are derived predominantly from asthenospheric mantle ( Richards et al . , 2003 ) .
Together with the preferential association of porphyry Cu deposits with thickened crust , this suggests that the lower crust in the UDMA had been thickened and rejuvenated .
As discussed above , the intrusions associated with the porphyry Cu deposits in the three separate segments of the Eastern Tethyan belt display similar geochemical characteristics when compared with the coeval magmatic rocks from the same regions .
Here , we present a geochemical study and comparison of the major Miocene ore - related porphyries and coeval ore - barren magmatic rocks in the Urumieh - Dokhtar magmatic arc in Iran and the Chagai belt in Pakistan , and the Eastern Gangdese belt of the Himalaya .
In fact , this is inconsistent with geologic observations , because most of the reported Miocene igneous rocks from both the UDMA and Chagai belts have intermediate to felsic compositions , and the small volumes of Miocene mafic high - K to ultrapotassic rocks are only found in the northwest UDMA ( Mghadam et al . , 2014 ; Pang et al . , 2013 ; Richards et al . , 2012 ) .
Many adakitic rocks have been described in the slab window of West Junggar , and we know there are relevant hydrothermal vent Cu - Au deposits in West Junngar , but so far no symmetrical zonation of the deposits has been defined , which would help to confirm and constrain the slab window .
The key magmatic products are adakites that include plutonic and volcanic rocks with intermediate - to high - SiO2 , high Sr / Y ratios , elevated MgO , Na2O , K2O , Ni hornblende / biotite - bearing high - Mg diorites , and granodiorites to hornblende / pyroxene and Cr contents , and high LILE and LREE elements .
Examples of these relations within the CAOB are seen in the accreted , low - grade OPS in Mongolia ( Kurihara et al . , 2009 ; Safonova , 2009 ; Safonova et al . 2015 ) , the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
However , these are early days , because most parts of the CAOB have yet to be investigated for evidence of ridge subduction and slab windows , so the prospects are high .
They are typically associated with a wide variety of coeval and compositionally diverse volcanic rocks such as high - Ca boninites , tholeiitic , high - T basalts , alkaline basalts , charnockites , peraluminous TTGs , I - type granites , and mid - ocean ridge ( MOR ) ( not supra - subduction ) ophiolites .
Thus , the presence in accretionary or collisional orogens of OPS floored by MOR basalts provides another major indicator of ridge subduction .
We applied SCB and contour mapping methods to model anomalies .
In this regard , receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) analysis ( Swets , 1988 ) and success rate curves ( Chung and Fabbri , 2003 ; Agterberg and Bonham - Carter , 2005 ) could be employed to assess the ability of evidence layers or geochemical signatures in predicting mineral deposits ( e . g . , Carranza , 2008 ; Nykänen et al . , 2014 ; Andrada de Palomera et al . , 2014 ; Carranza and Laborte , 2015c ) .
Recognition of significant mineralization - related multi - element geochemical signatures is a challenge , because factor analysis may reveals more than one multi - element association ( i . e . , factors ) representing the same deposit of the type sought .
There are various factors that affect dispersion patterns of geochemical elements in different areas ( Spadoni , 2006 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Yousefi et al . , 2013 ) .
Various studies have applied contour mapping and SCB for modeling geochemical anomalies using stream sediment data ( e . g . , Hawkes , 1976 ; Bonham - Carter et al . , 1987 , 1988Carranza , 2004Carranza , , 2008Carranza , , 2010a .
