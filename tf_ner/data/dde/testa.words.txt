Subduction processes are thought to ultimately cause enrichment of metals ( Cu , Au ) and S ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ) and the relatively high oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and high H 2 O contents in arc magmas ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) that are critical to the formation of PCDs .
The Jurassic arc rocks are mainly calc - alkaline , and are characterized by enrichment in large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE ; e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSE ; e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) with flat heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) , thus showing typical subduction - related geochemical features ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1993 ) .
The average zircon e Hf ( t ) values of the Jurassic rocks decrease significantly from the WSJA ( average + 16 ) to the ESJA ( average + 6 ) , suggesting distinct intra - crustal magmatic processes along the arc .
The India - Asia continental collision zone was built on a complex tectonic collage of terranes accreted onto the southern margin of the Asian continent since the Mesozoic ( Fig . 1A ; Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
The Miocene PCDs show a close spatial relationship with the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , despite being separated by a time interval of ~ 170 - 130 m . y .
Pronounced crustal thickening at 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) and subsequent slab break - off ( or tearing ) starting at 25 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) triggered this remelting as isotherms rebounded and / or hot asthenospheric melts infiltrated the lithosphere ( Richards , 2009 ) .
For example , the giant Qulong deposit ( 1420 Mt at 0 . 5 % Cu and 0 . 03 % Mo ; is partly hosted by Jurassic dacitic lavas .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions with those of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
By contrast , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are free of inherited zircons , and have relatively " depleted " isotopic compositions and younger Hf model ages ( average 800 Ma ) , suggesting a juvenile source ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2013a .
In addition , the Miocene Cu - Morelated porphyries have higher Sr / Y ratios ( 23 - 186 ) and higher ( La / Yb ) N ratios ( 11 - 47 ) than the Jurassic rocks , showing geochemical affinity with adakite ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
In contrast , localization of Miocene PCDs within the Jurassic arc implies that metal - rich Jurassic cumulates could release Cu into the Miocene porphyry systems ( Lee et al . . , 2012 ) .
Other PCDs are ~ 20 - 50 km away from Jurassic magmatic rocks ( Fig . 1B ) .
Geochemical and isotope data suggest that the WSJA arc rocks associated with the subduction - related PCDs derive from subductionmodified asthenospheric mantle ( Fig . 2 ; Fig . DR1 ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .
By contrast , incorporation of older crust by the ESJA basaltic rock , indicated by the lower and variable zircon e Hf ( t ) ( + 1 to + 12 ) , may be responsible for lowering magmatic f O 2 ( e . g . , Ripley and Li , 2013 ) , thus inducing sulfide saturation ( Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) and sequestering Cu - rich sulfides ( Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) in the Jurassic lower - crustal arc cumulates ( Fig . 3 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons from the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
This suggests that remelting of the Jurassic cumulates took place in a thickened crust ( > 50 - 55 km ) within the amphibole and garnet stability field ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) , consistent with Cenozoic collision - induced crustal thickening in south Tibet ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
Copper contents of primary magmas are controlled by the oxidation state of their source , which determines the stability of residual sulphide phases , the main host of Cu ( refs 8 , 11 ) : higher oxidation states in the source result in higher Cu contents of the primary magma 8 .
Averages of median Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot values at 4 - 6 wt % MgO are also significantly correlated for the 23 arcs ( Fig . 2c ) .
Magmatic H 2 O contents and fO 2 play a prominent role in the development of tholeiitic versus calc - alkaline trends [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 18 : high water contents and fO 2 lead to calc - alkaline trends through suppression of plagioclase fractionation and promotion of early magnetite and amphibole fractionation 4 , 6 .
Copper saturation in magmas is intimately bound to the onset of magnetite crystallization 23 , which induces sulphide saturation and consequent Cu sequestration into either a fluid 24 or , more likely , a sulphide melt 25 , 26 .
The ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc carried by magmas in thin arcs correspond to the theoretic average global Cu flux through arcs ( Supplementary Table 5 ) , suggesting that in thin arcs Cu is quantitatively carried by magmas .
A simple fractional crystallization model using MELTS , a software package for modelling phase equilibria in magmatic systems ( refs 21 , 22 ) , reproduces the observed Fe 2 O 3tot - MgO trends by varying H 2 O contents ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ) .
I find that magmas of thicker arcs are systematically more calc - alkaline and more depleted copper than magmas of thinner arcs .
As far as the water content effect on the calc - alkaline trend is concerned , this correlation is better accounted for by the fact that magmatic evolution occurs on average at deeper crustal levels in thick arcs compared with thin arcs 17 , 19 .
In contrast , arc magmas evolving in thicker crust start to lose Cu early because of early magnetite crystallization , which also produces a calc - alkaline trend therein ( Fig . 1a , b ) .
The formation of calc - alkaline magmas is favoured by high water content and oxygen fugacity 4 - 7 .
The differential Cu evolution in thin ( tholeiitic ) and thick ( calc - alkaline ) arcs implies that magmatic products in thin arcs carry on average ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc , whereas those in thick arcs carry on average only 4 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc ( Supplementary Table 4 and Fig . 2 ) .
Figure 2b shows that the thicker the arc crust the more calc - alkaline magmas ( see also refs 16 , 17 ) .
The authors inferred that the Cu lost by evolving arc magmas is sequestered by sulphide phases in the lower crust .
These characteristics , as well as magmatic metal contents , are thought to be imparted in the mantle source by fluids of the subducted slab 8 - 10 .
The global scale correlations among arc crustal thickness , Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot have important implications for the understanding of firstorder factors controlling the development of calc - alkaline versus tholeiitic trends and Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas .
The results presented here suggest that larger amounts of Cu can be concentrated within or at the base of the crust of thicker arc segments and may provide a consistent explanation to why porphyry copper systems form preferentially ( although not exclusively ) in thick arcs in association with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
8 ) , recent studies 14 , 15 suggest that the oxidation state of the subarc mantle is not significantly different from that of the mantle under ocean ridges and that Cu contents of the primitive magmas generated in these two contexts are similar 11 .
The above arguments suggest that the processes of Cu depletion in arc magmas , which may ultimately play an important role in the Cu deficit of the continental crust and in the formation of porphyry copper deposits 11 , are controlled by the upper plate .
Nonetheless , as shown by the heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of porphyry - type deposits also within thick arcs 12 , only a special combination of regional to local scale conditions 28 will ultimately allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems within the generally favourable environment of thick arcs .
Continental China is a mosaic of numerous tectonic blocks , which amalgamated from Neoarchean through Cenozoic broadly coeval with the cycles of global supercontinents such as Kenorland , Columbia , Rodinia , Gondwana , and Pangaea .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .

The closure of Mianlue ocean started first in the Dabie region and migrated westward ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . 2006 ) from the Early Permian and to Middle - Late Triassic , causing the formation of Mianlue suture ( [ 26 ] ) .

Metallogenesis related tomes - and Neo - Tethyan evolution
The asthenosphere upwelling after the removal is an efficient mechanism to trigger the partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust .
The partial melting metasomatized lithospheric mantle and juvenile crust was responsible for the production of highly oxidized magma and corresponding formation of Cu - Au - Mo ore deposits upon the previous subduction zone .
The fault control on the mineralization is in conformity with the Ar - Ar isochron age ~ 27 Ma of phlogopite from the mineralized lamprophyre , which intruded at ~ 35 Ma , representing the main mineralization stage ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) .

Orebodies are predominantly banded quartz veins , which are strictly controlled by bedding faults .
Abundant Fe - Ti oxide ore deposits are associated with less evolved basaltic magma in the Emeishan large igneous province than elsewhere in the world and the difference is attributed to selective assimilation of newly subducted , stagnant oceanic lithospheric slab by the ascending mantle plume - derived picritic magma that was originally undersaturated with Fe - Ti oxides ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .

In southern Tibet , especially the Gangdese belt , ( ultra - ) potassic and adakitic magmas with emplacement ages ranging from 25 to 10 Ma are present in the Lhasa Block and were interpreted to be related to the removal of the lower part of the lithospheric mantle via convective thinning mechanism ( Platt and England , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 2001 ) .
The Late Cretaceous magmatism in the central to eastern South China Block may likely mark the onset of back - arc extension or intra - arc rift in the region during Late Cretaceous .

The Hf isotopic systematics indicate that the central Lhasa represents a long - lived micro - continent and the northern and southern Lhasa were young juvenile crustal blocks involving significant mantle materials ( Zhu et al . , 2011d ; Yang et al . , 2016aYang et al . , , 2016b .
The Sanjiang orogenic belt experienced Proto - , Paleo - , Meso - , and Neo - Tethyan evolution and the subsequent oblique continental collision ( Deng et al . , 2014a ( Deng et al . , , 2014b .
The subduction of the Neo - Tethys oceanic plate beneath the Tengchong Block from Late Cretaceous to Paleogene formed abundant S - type granitoids and many skarn - type and greisen - type Sn - W deposits ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) .
The metallogenic granitoids in the Hongshan and Tongchanggou ore deposits generally have higher NaO + K 2 O content than those in the Pulang and Lannitang ( Fig . 15a ) , and they mostly fall into the shoshonitic domain ( Fig . 15b ) and range from metaluminous to peraluminous series ( Fig . 15c ) .
The granitoids associated with the Beiya , Yao - an , Machangqing ore deposits show more shoshonitic feature than those responsible for the mineralization in the Yulong ( Fig . 15 ) ( Lu et al . , 2013 ) .
The welding boundaries amalgamated blocks with weak mechanical strength served as the deformation zones to adjust the movement of the smaller blocks .
The tabular orebodies in this ore deposit are hosted in Paleocene Yunlong Formation and the overlying early - Cretaceous Jingxing Formation ( Xue et al . , 2000 ) .

The E - W - trending Middle - Lower Yangtze Valley metallogenic belt , located in the northern margin of the Yangtze Craton ( Fig . 16 ) , hosts two major types of ore deposits : porphyry - skarn - stratabound Cu - Au - Mo - Fe deposits with an age range of 137 - 143 Ma and apatite - magnetite deposits with ages of 125 - 123 Ma ( Mao et al . , 2006 , Mao et al . , 2011b .
The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction of Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting of metasedimentary rocks in the overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The upwelling of asthenospheric mantle , associated with the flat subduction of Pacific plate , may have triggered partial melting of metasedimentary rocks in the overlying crust to generate S - type granitic magmas ( Xu et al . , 2015a ) .
The Yangtze Craton witnessed double - sided oceanic subduction in the Neoproterozoic as supported by the occurrence of arc magmatic rocks , resulting in the formation of juvenile lower crust along both sides and the production of Neoproterozoic Pingshui VMS Cu deposit along the southeastern margin ( Wang et al . , 2015b ) .
The ore - forming granitoids in the Middle to Lower Yangtze River Cu - Au - Fe polymetallic metallogenic belt are metaluminous to peraluminous , with widely varying εHf ( t ) values between the evolution lines of 1 . 2 Ga and 2 . 8 Ga ( Fig . 17 ) .
The Tibetan region was affected by the accretionary orogenesis from Proto - , Paleo - , Meso - to Neo - Tethyan consumption ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) with normal continental collision initiated from ~ 55 Ma ( Figs . 4 , 12 , and 25 ) .
The superimposed orogeny is best exemplified by the Tibet Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ) orogenic belts , which comprise blocks separated from Gondwana through the opening of Paleo - , Meso - , and Neo - Tethyan oceans ( Fig . 5 ) .
The blocks were located along the Gondwana margin from Cambrian to Ordovician , and they experienced subduction of Proto - Tethyan Ocean resulting in the long - lasting magmatism blocks .
The lithosphere shortening and rotation , as well as lower lithospheric mantle removal , which was considered to have triggered the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism ( Deng et al . , 2014b ) , has largely reshaped the lithospheric structure .
The sutures in North China Craton include the Inner Mongolia suture , Trans - North China Orogen and Jiao - Liao - Ji Belt , as well as those between the smaller Archean blocks ( Fig . 7 ) .
The reactivation syn - depositional faults formed in the previous tectonic regimes was favorable for the transportation of metal - carrying magmas and fluids .
The analysis on the geochemical characteristics of ore - forming granitoids from the different tectonic units displayed that the superimposed orogeny exerted significant control on the source of metallogenic granitoid and the associated metal species ( Figs . 6 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 and 17 ) . During the early orogenic phase of the superimposed orogenic system , mantle melt contributed to the formation of juvenile mafic lower crust , resulting in formation of Cudominant ore deposits .
The different sources magma mixing yielded three potential sources that caused a large variation in the metal species and their combinations .
The lithospheric stacking or crustal thickening could have occurred simultaneously with the formation juvenile lower crust which evolved from the mantle .
The reactivation of ancient sutures , craton margins and arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) . Precursor subduction - related magmatism is important because such processes leave ore - metal enriched residue in cumulate zones within the juvenile crust , which can be re - mobilized during later partial melting .
The partial melts oxidized , and will therefore have the potential to form magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits in the upper crustal levels .
The transition tectonic regime within the same tectonic unit over a long period of time result in the re - mobilization and superposition of same ore deposit ( Zhai et al . , 2009 ) . In the Bayan Obo super - large REE ore deposit , located in the northern margin of North China Craton ( Fig . 8 ) , the REE - Nb - Fe orebodies were produced in related to the intrusion of Mo - Sn porphyry and skarn orebodies underneath the Carboniferous stratiform orebodies at a deposit - scale ( Fig . 22 ) .
The hydrothermal was considered to migrate along the previously formed syn - depositional fault associated with the sulfide horizon .
The ancient sutures and their environs between different blocks , including continental marginal arc and rift , served as favorable locales for the production of orogenic Au deposits , intracontinental porphyry - skarn ore deposits , and others , generated in later orogenesis during superimposed orogeny .
This arc is composed of Triassic arc volcanic rocks and plutons emplaced from 230Ma to 204Ma ( Li et al . , 2011a ; Leng et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2016a ) .

17 ) deposits in the Sanjiang and those formed at ~ 15 Ma deposits in the Tibet , derived from previous juvenile crust and exclude the involvement of ancient crustal material during the Indian - Eurasian collision .
69 ) deposit represents a sulfide - rich Ni - Cu - PGE deposit ( Song et al . , 2003 ) ; and the Limahe ( No .
98 ) orogenic goldfield is located in the southern section of the Shi - Hang Metallogenic Belt ( Fig . 16 ) .
This lithospheric structure determined the source of metallogenic granitoid orfluid and the associated metal species , causing mineralization of diverse metal species .
These granites in the Shi - Hang zone are characterized by significantly higher Sm ( > 8 ppm ) and Nd ( > 45 ppm ) with relatively higher εNd ( t ) values ( - 2 to - 8 ) and younger T DM C ages ( < 1 . 5 Ga ) ( Chen and Jahn , 1998 ) .
Later tectono - magmatism and subsequent hydrothermal events remobilized Au and drove the ore - forming fluids to dilational fracture zones ( Wang et al . , 2014b ) .
These adakite - like rocks range from strongly porphyritic to more equigranular textured intrusions .

In the Mujicun porphyry Cu - Mo deposit located in the Trans - North China orogen , the Re - Os ages ore molybdenite and zircon U - Pb ages for ore host porphyry suggest the magmatism and mineralization occurred from ~ 143 Ma to ~ 138 Ma ( Dong et al . , 2013 ) .

170 - 110 Ma metallogenic granites higher εHf ( t ) values of 0 to 14 with T DM C ages of 1 . 4 Ga to 0 . 4 Ga , indicating the parental magma was melted from thinned ancient crust with mixture with mantle melt or slightly earlier juvenile crust melt .
Triggers for superimposed orogeny
In contrast , mantle xenoliths sampled by Meso - Cenozoic kimberlites and Cenozoic basalts reveal thin ( 80 - 120 km ) , hot , and fertile lithosphere beneath the eastern half of the North China Craton ( Basu et al . , 1991 ; Fan et al . , 2000 ) .

The oreforming porphyry in Sharang has enriched initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios ( 0 . 705797 ~ 0 . 706788 ) , εNd ( t ) values ( - 3 . 37 ~ - 4 . 59 ) ( Zhao et al . , 2011b ) and zircon εHf ( t ) from - 5 to 5 ( Zhao et al . , 2014e plateau - like age of 59 . 34 ± 0 . 62 Ma , later than the onset of the Indo - Asian collision ( Fig . 12 ) .
In the case of Sanjiang and Tibet Tethyan orogenic belts , the metallogenic porphyry intrusions , produced from former juvenile crust later Indian - Eurasian collision , show more shoshonitic features than those generated via the oceanic subduction .

This implies that the late - Mesozoic postorogenic extension after Paleo - Asian and Mongol - Okhotsk oceans closure has thinned the crust and caused the melting of both juvenile and ancient crusts to generate metal carrying magmas ( Fig . 6 ) .
There are several Au deposits in the eastern section of the regional Jiang−Shao Fault between the Yangtze and Cathaysia Blocks in South China Block ( Fig . 16 ) . An Early Paleozoic orogenic Au belt in the eastern section of the Jiang−Shao Fault formed in response to the coeval northward underthrusting of the Cathaysia Block beneath the Yangtze Block during Caledonian ( Ni et al . , 2015 ) .
For instance , the Mesozoic magmatism in Cathaysia Block lasted from Jurassic to Cretaceous ( Zhou et al . , 2006b ) .

They belong to the high - K calc - alkaline , and are enriched in large - ion lithophile elements ( LILEs ) such as Rb , Ba , Th , U , and Pb , and depleted in high field strength elements ( HFSEs ) , such as Nb , Ta .
The syndepositional mineralization occurred during the Devonian and early Carboniferous eras .
Associated with the metasomatism , concomitant juvenile lower crust with possible preliminary metal enrichment formed as the arc magma the mantle - crust boundary .
The later episode of granites show more metaluminous feature , in contrast to the earlier episode that mostly displays peraluminous affinity .
Abundant xenocrystic zircons with U - Pb ages clustered at about 840 Ma and εHf ( t ) ranging from largely negative to highly positive were entrained in the ( ultra - ) potassic felsic intrusive rocks in the western South China Block ( Deng et al . , 2015c ) .
The results show that the mosaic structure of China bears two most conspicuous features of metallogeny : ( 1 ) each tectonic belt witnessed multi - stage mineralization of diverse genetic types ; ( 2 ) each type of mineralization has distinct affiliation to specific tectonic setting .
should be regarded as maximum ages for the REE mineralization in the study area ( Liu et al . , 2015a ) .

12 ) W - Mo polymetallic skarn deposit is located in the central - eastern part of Gangdese belt in Lhasa terrane , Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) .
In the former case , the ore fluid was composed of both basinal brine and magmatic hydrothermal , which take different percentage in different ore deposits in the fluid ( Tao et al . , 2011 ) ; and in the later , the fluid components include metamorphic fluid and basinal brine , and these two kinds of fluid both formed independent ore deposit and participated in the same deposit ( Deng et al , 2016c ) .
varying from 0 to 10 with T DM C ages from 1 . 3 Ga to 0 . 7 Ga , indicating the involvement of ancient crustal material in the mantle - or juvenile crust - derived melt ( Fig . 6 ) .
In the western part , the metallogeny was mainly related to large igneous province and the Carlin - like Au metallogeny ; in contrast , in the eastern part , the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granite - related metallogeny is dominated ( Fig . 16 ) .
studies suggest that these enclaves were captured from an underlying body during the eruption of island - arc magma .
The metallogenic intrusive rocks for the Saishitang and Hutouya are calc - alkaline series , and they have variable εHf ( t ) values ( −3 to 5 ) .
event at ~ 230 - 240 Ma and amphibolite - facies metamorphism at ~ 220 - 210 Ma ( Liu et al . , 2006 ( Liu et al . , , 2007Xu et al . , 2009b ; Li et al . , 2012e ) .
This generally explains the evolution felsic magma - related ore metal associations proceeding during the superimposed orogeny .
The meta - igneous rocks are enriched in LILE and LREE and depleted high field strength elements Nb , Ta and Ti , have geochemical signatures that are similar to those of arc volcanic rocks .
The geodynamic engine of the Jiaodong - type Au deposit is considered to be oceanic subduction coupled with lithospheric thinning ( Zhu et al . , 2015a with structural control in the shallow crust .
Later at ~ 32 to 27 Ma , the large - scale continental underthrust resulted in the release of regional metamorphic fluid , bringing gold out of the juvenile crust and forming the orogenic Au deposits the Ailaoshan shear system along the western margin of South China Block ( Fig . 19 ) . The Cu - Au - Mo metallogenic porphyries in the Beiya ( No .
Coeval with this transition , the Neo - Tethyan oceanic slab was considered to have detached from the India continental lithosphere based on the Himalayan metamorphic record ( e . g . , Decelles et al . , 2002 ; Kohn and Parkinson , 2002 ) .
The earlier to later phase of granites medium K calc - alkaline series to high - K calc - alkaline and shoshonitic series , and the associated metal species changed from Cu - dominant to Mo - dominant .
It was thus inferred that the parental magma was partly sourced from juvenile crust formed at 2 . 7 Ga .

The geodynamic setting of this deposit is related to post - collisional extension ( Ding et al . , 2014 136 and 211 Ma , respectively .
200 km ) , ancient , refractory lithosphere root in the early Paleozoic ( Fan et al . , 2000 ) .
It was further proposed that the subduction of Indian continent was the main drive for the buildup of Tibet plateau ( Royden et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to the drive from oceanic or continental subduction , the Cretaceous Pacific superplume event may have generated a strong far - field push toward the East Asia continental margin , resulting in subduction of the Izanagi plate and causing rifting and magmatism accompanied by the formation of a variety of mineral systems ( Pirajno et al . , 2015 ) .
This supports the inference that metasomatism of the lithospheric mantle in the northwestern South China Block occurred at ~ 840 Ma .
Geochemically , the granites are strongly peraluminous , with high contents of alkalis , belonging to highly fractionated S - type granites ( Fig . 17 ) .
The metallogenic time lasted from Late Ordovician to Miocene .
More than fifty post - collisional adakite - like intrusions have been recognized in a narrow and 1500 km long EW - trending belt along the southern part of the Lhasa terrane ( Fig . 12 ) .
The regional metallogeny driven by superimposed orogeny was represented by the composite metallogenic system , which was dominantly characterized by the multi - episodic and diverse mineralization concomitant with one or more features including mineralization evolved from previous metal enrichment , later overlap of ore deposit , and diversifying of metal species derived from reworked lithosphere .
The discussion above shows that the superimposed orogeny has played important role on the metallogenesis .
This suggests their derivation from a thickened juvenile crust evolved from depleted mantle - derived material with possible minor input of continental rocks ( Fig . 9 ) .
The geochemical compositions with the Mo - carrying granitoid in the ore deposits Yuchiling , Shijiawan , and Donggou , show the metallogenic granitoid are high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic ( Fig . 9 ) .

It has been proposed that two pairs of Paleo - Tethyan sutures the LongmuTso - Shuanghu and Changning - Menglian ( [ 17 ] ) and Jinshajiang and Ailaoshan ( [ 23 ] ) are developed with comparable magmatic and sedimentary records ( Deng et al . , 2014a ) .
In the Middle and Lower Yangtze River , the stratiform skarn Cu orebody was considered to have overlapped a primary sulfide horizon , which formed through sedimentary process in Carboniferous ( Fig . 23 ) .
Driven by the superimposed orogeny , the composite metallogenesis is a salient feature of the regional metallogeny in China ( Fig . 25 ) .
The results suggest the lithosphere of the eastern North China Craton extensive thinning and destruction as compared with that in the central part ( Shen et al . , 2013b ) .
An analysis of the timeline shows that the mineralizations preferentially formed during the later events during the superimposed orogeny ( Fig . 18 ) .
The ore deposits in this period include the BIF , VMS and carbonatite - related REE ore deposit ranging from Archean , late - Paleoproterozoic , to Neo - Proterozoic ( Fig . 8 ) .
The peak of 2 . 0 Ga was another time for the crustal growth via oceanic subduction in North China Craton ( Zhao , 2001 ) .

The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment during the previous subduction - and later collision - related magmatic events in the Lhasa block provide important insights into mineral potential .
Examples of the dominant types of superimposed orogeny in China include : ( 1 ) Cenozoic continental collision superimposed on Paleo - to Mesozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet and Sanjiang orogenic belts ; ( 2 ) Reactivation of Paleozoic accretionary orogen in later Mesozoic oceanic subduction in the eastern part of Qinling–Qilian–Kunlun and Central Asian orogenic belts ; ( 3 ) Mesozoic oceanic subduction under the paleo - suture in the South China Block ; ( 4 ) Mesozoic demantling along the Paleo - and Neoproterozoic , and Paleozoic sutures in the eastern part of North China Craton ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab .

Their old T DM C ages , peraluminous to metaluminous affinity , and the associated Cu - dominant mineralization , suggesting the crustal source were most likely composed of mafic juvenile crust originated from mantle , since the period of 2 . 85 Ga to 2 . 40 Ga was an important stage for crust growth via oceanic subduction in the craton .
2 ) contains > 500 million metric tons of sulfide ores with grades of 1 . 1 wt . % Ni and 0 . 7 wt . % Cu , and is the largest single magmatic Ni - Cu sulfide ore deposit in the world ( Li and Ripley , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) .
The metallogeny in this craton started from Precambrian and reached the climax in late Cretaceous with the formation of the Jiaodongtype gold deposits and porphyry Mo deposits .
From regional geology , lithologic association , and geochemical features of the associated meta - volcanics and orthogneisses , previous studies suggested that the highgrade BIF formed initially in arcs , which were intruded by voluminous tonalities and granodiorites , and later converted by deformation and high - grade metamorphism into orthogneisses .
Individual systems have life spans of ~ 100 , 000 to several mil - lion years , whereas deposit clusters or alignments as well as entire belts may remain active for 10 m . y .
Porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits are centered on the intrusions , whereas car - bonate wall rocks commonly host proximal Cu - Au skarns , less common distal Zn - Pb and / or Au skarns , and , beyond the skarn front , carbonate - replacement Cu and / or Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au deposits , and / or sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ) Au deposits .

High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may occur in lithocaps above porphyry Cu deposits , where massive sulfide lodes tend to develop in deeper feeder structures and Au ± Ag - rich disseminated deposits within the uppermost 500 m or so .
Low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite ± bornite assemblages are characteristic of potassic zones , whereas higher sulfidation - state sul - fides are generated progressively upward in concert with temperature decline and the concomitant greater degrees of hydrolytic alteration , culminating in pyrite ± enargite ± covellite in the shallow parts of the litho - caps .
Porphyry Cu systems are initiated by injection of oxidized magma saturated with S - and metal - rich , aqueous fluids from cupolas on the tops of the subjacent parental plutons .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .
Late - stage alteration overprints may cause partial depletion or complete removal of Cu and Au , but metal concentration may also result .
PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes ( 10− > 100 km 3 ) of hydrothermally altered rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal base and precious metal mineralization .
The deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems may contain porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits of various sizes ( < 10 million metric tons [ Mt ] - 10 billion metric tons [ Gt ] ) as well as Cu , Au , and / or Zn skarns ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) , whereas their shallower parts may host high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal Au ± Ag ± Cu orebodies ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) .
Porphyry Cu systems presently supply nearly three - quarters Cu , half the Mo , perhaps one - fifth of the Au , most of the Re , and minor amounts of other metals ( Ag , Pd , Te , Se , Bi , Zn , and Pb ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .
Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Quartzkaolinite
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10−12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .
Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S ± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
The quartz - veined cores potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .
High Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .
At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts porphyry Cu stocks overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .
Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing and bornite - free potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts of porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration mineralization .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .
The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .
The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low ( e . g . , quartz sandstone , felsic igneous rocks ) rather than high ( mafic igneous rocks ) acid - buffering capacities .
Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .
The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .
The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage , nearly monomineralic veinlets .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery cristobalite , alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .
The Cu ± Mo ± Au cores typically have kilometer - scale halos defined by anomalous Zn , Pb , and Ag values that reflect lower temperature , hydrothermal conditions ( Fig . 9a , b ) .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .
Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .
These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These Zn - Pb - Ag ± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As ± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
Such a decrease solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .
There , Cu ± Mo ± Au characterize the potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic cores of systems .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
The more structurally confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .
The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite illite / smectite .
( 7 ) if externally derived nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .
Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .
Commonly , the highest grade most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .
Generalized alteration - mineralization zoning pattern for telescoped porphyry Cu deposits , based on the geologic and deposit - type template presented as Figure 6 .
Any exposed A - type quartz veinlet stockworks overprinted by sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages immediately pinpoint the spots for initial scout drilling ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
Injection of fine - grained , igneous matrix defines the igneous breccia near the base of the body .
End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
Where intense chlorite - sericite or sericitic alteration overprints are developed , the reconstitution of potassic alteration may result in either reduction complete stripping of original metal contents .
In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .
However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .
However , the El Indio and Yanacocha high - sulfidation Au deposits were initially the isolated orebodies that led to eventual definition of the El Indio - Maricunga and Cajamarca - Huaraz belts , respectively .
Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .
In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries lithocaps .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
Many features of porphyry Cu systems at all scales need to be taken into account during planning and exe - cution of base and precious metal exploration programs in magmatic arc settings .
The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .
( 4 ) how is the single - phase magmatic liquid transferred from the parental magma chambers to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , and what distance can be travelled by this fluid between exiting the chambers and eventual phase separation ?
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma ceases , there are marked reductions in both the heat flux and aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H . SILLITOE 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 6 and 10 to show the evolution of the main magmatic fluid and alteration - mineralization types in concert with progressive downward magma solidification , cooling , and paleosurface degradation .
Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .
Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .
Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .
In contrast , large high - sulfidation epithermal deposits average 1 to 3 g / t Au but have only minor Cu , commonly as a result of supergene removal .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .
( 8 ) what controls metal depletion versus enrichment during chlorite - sericite overprints ?
In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( ± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .
However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .
They commonly occur as tabular veins overprinting porphyry Cu deposits , like those at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) , Escondida ( Ojeda , 1986 ) , Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , and Collahuasi , northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
The legend explains the temporal sequence of rock types , with the porphyry stock predating maardiatreme emplacement , which in turn overlaps lithocap development and phreatic brecciation .
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions in early quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .
( 3 ) how important are mafic magmas in the development of the parental magma chambers beneath porphyry Cu systems , and what material contributions do they make to the systems themselves ?
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Assessment of the likely host - rock lithologic units is also important during initial appraisals of porphyry Cu belts and districts .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits , typically with above - average Cu tenors .
in the case of long - lived porphyry Cu systems , whereas elsewhere the loci of intrusive and hydrothermal activity migrate , either systematically or randomly , to give rise to the porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposit clusters and alignments discussed above .
c . Sepon , Laos , where two subeconomic porphyry Mo - Cu centers marked by quartz veinlet stockworks are zoned outward through carbonate - replacement Cu to sediment - hosted Au deposits without any intervening Zn - Pb - Ag zone ( summarized from R . H . Sillitoe , unpub .
However , if the overprinted high - sulfidation assemblages also contain appreciable arsenical sulfosalts , a situation that becomes increasingly likely upward in most systems , the resultant mineralization is less desirable because it is not only refractory if subjected to bacterial heap leaching but also generates As - rich flotation concentrates that may prove difficult to market .
The deeper , central cores of porphyry Cu systems are occupied by porphyry Cu deposits , in which ore - zone geometries depend mainly on the overall form of the host stock or dike complex , the depositional sites of the Cu - bearing sulfides , and the positions of any late , low - and subore - grade porphyry intrusions and diatremes .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au and , less commonly , distal Au skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .
A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al . ( 2003 ) .

( 2003 ) .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .
If this scenario is correct , a single - phase low - to moderate - salinity ( 5−20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .
Mining and deep drilling in a few large porphyry Cu deposits show that mineralized intrusions have vertical extents of > 2 km ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida , northern Chile , and Grasberg ) and , based on evidence from the steeply tilted systems , perhaps ≥4 km ( Dilles , 1987 ; Seedorff et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 6 ) .
However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .
At the early stage ( left side ) , magma is present at the top of the parental chamber , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid exits the magma and undergoes phase separation during ascent to generate immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor , which generate potassic alteration plus contained low sulfidation - state porphyry Cu ± Au mineralization .
Nevertheless , it also characterizes the centrally located zones of some porphyry Cu stocks ( e . g . , Koloula , Solomon Islands and Island Copper , British Columbia ; Chivas , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995 ; Arancibia and Clark , 1996 ) .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , skarn Cu ± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high temperature vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .
Once the plutonic magmas stagnate , the high - temperature , generally two - phase hyper - saline liquid and vapor responsible for the potassic alteration and contained mineralization at depth and early overlying advanced argillic alteration , respectively , gives way , at < 350 °C , to a single phase liquid that causes the sericite - chlorite and sericitic alteration and associated mineralization .

At the deposit scale , particularly in the por - phyry Cu environment , early - formed features commonly , but by no means always , give rise to the best ore - bodies .
Under these lower temperature conditions , sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration zones begin to form from a deeply derived , single - phase aqueous liquid generated by one or both of the methods ( see text ) postulated by and Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) .
See text for further details and Table 2 for alteration - mineralization details .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .
( 11 ) what is the fluid regime responsible for metal zoning in lithocaps , and why are so many lithocaps apparently barren ?
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Even cursory inspection of Figure 6 shows clearly that erosion level is a fundamental control on the mineralization types that may be anticipated to occur in porphyry Cu systems .
Renewed neutralization of this same liquid on exiting the lithocap and / or aliquots of the deep liquid that bypass the lithocap entirely may give rise to peripheral intermediate - sulfidation ( IS ) epithermal mineralization .
The degree of overprinting is perhaps best appreciated in some magmatichydro thermal breccia bodies in which isolated magnetite aggregates occur as stranded remnants in sericitic or chloritesericite zones up to 1 km above the magnetite - cemented , potassic parts ( e . g . , Chimborazo , northern Chile ; Fig . 8 ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit , northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; Perelló et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Perelló , 2006 ) .
Schematic representation of generalized alteration - mineralization sequence in porphyry Cu systems paleodepth and system life span .
Only in the last decade or so , however , have the physicochemical connections with the high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal environment within and around overlying lithocaps been clarified ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2001 .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .
However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
Partial melting sediments may occur under some restricted conditions , but is unlikely to be a widespread process ( in Phanerozoic arcs ) , and does not significantly differ metallogenically from slab - dehydration processes .
Concentrations of chalcophile and siderophile metals in these partial melts depend critically on the presence and abundance of residual sulfide phases in the mantle source .
Gold - rich porphyry deposits would only form where residual sulfide abundance low ( magma / sulfide ratio N 10 5 ) , perhaps due to unusually high mantle wedge oxidation states .
Partial melting subduction - modified sources due to post - subduction thermal readjustments or asthenospheric melt invasion will generate small volumes of calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline magmas , which may redissolve residual sulfides .

Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .
Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Sediment dehydration and / or melting in subduction zones
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .
Lithospheric melting during post - subduction events
Previously asthenosphere is unlikely to be a viable source except for a short period after subduction has ceased ( e . g . , Richards et al . , 1990 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , because such material will be quickly dispersed by mantle convection .
Collisional orogens commonly undergo crustal thickening followed by extensional or transpressional collapse .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .
Post - subduction tectonic environments conducive to the formation of porphyry and epithermal deposits by remobilization of previously subduction - modified lithosphere ( modified from Richards , 2009 ) .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .
Porphyry Mo and Sn - W deposits associated with felsic magmas in continental interiors are thought to form mainly by partial melting of continental crust during rifting to form S - type , lithophile element - rich granitic magmas .
At relatively high abundances of sulfides thought to be typical of active arcs where f S2 and f O2 high ( magma / sulfide ratio = 10 2 - 10 5 ) , sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE will be retained in the source , but magmas may be relatively undepleted in abundant , moderately chalcophile elements such as Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) .
In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .
In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .
The smaller volume partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .
At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Ti , Nb , and Y contents , high LREE / HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The glass inclusions characterized by Schiano et al . ( 1995 ) were calc - alkaline in composition , with high incompatible element and low Ti , Nb , and Y contents , high HREE ratios , and homogenization temperatures of 920 °C .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .
Such magmas may remobilize Au as well as Cu ± Mo left behind in residual sulfide phases by arc magmatism , leading to the potential formation of porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo and alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits .
Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions of arc magmatism , sulfur will be dominantly present as sulfate and sulfate , but saturation in small amounts of sulfide phases is also likely .
This lithosphere will have undergone significant modification during the previous subduction cycle , most importantly with the introduction of large volumes of hydrous amphibolitic cumulates residual from lower crustal differentiation of arc basalts .
Such magmas have the potential to form Au - rich as well as normal Cu ± Mo porphyry and epithermal Au systems , depending on the amounts of sulfide present lower crustal source .
Most base metals would be expected to have at least moderate solubilities in the hot , relatively oxidized , saline aqueous fluids exsolved from the downgoing slab .
Such sulfides would have retained significant amounts of the subduction flux Mo , but HSE would be diluted to low concentrations by the greater volume of sulfide ( low R - factor ; Fig . 2 ) .
These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .
These high sulfur contents have great significance for the behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals ( see Sections 2 . 1 . 1 , 2 . 5 . 1 , and 3 ) .
These volatiles drive buoyant , bubbly magma upwards into the cover rocks to form subvolcanic stocks and dikes , or explosive volcanic eruptions if they reach surface .
At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
Under lower f S2 post - subduction conditions ( a flux of S from the subduction zone is no longer present ) , any residual sulfide phases would likely dissolve into the S - undersaturated silicate melt , carrying their metal loads with them ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ) .
( a ) Porphyry Cu ± Mo deposits formed in normal arc settings ; a continental arc is shown , but similar processes can occur in mature island arcs .
Thus , mineralization may only occur where later moderate salinity liquids have followed a higher pressure , rather specialized cooling path , as described above ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ) .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .
In more oxidized subduction - related or post - subduction magmas , although sulfide saturation likely occurs at some point during their evolution ( as indicated by the common presence of sparse sulfide inclusions in phenocrysts in arc volcanic rocks as well as lower crustal arc cumulates ; e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ; Halter et al . , 2002 ; Hattori , 1997 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Fig . 5 ) , it may not occur to the extent that sulfides physically separate from the magma , or at least not in large amounts .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .
In post - subduction tectonic settings Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 , such as subduction migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting , a subducting slab source no longer exists , and magmas are predominantly derived from partial melting of the upper plate lithosphere .
Under the high f O2 and f S2 conditions of the supra - subduction zone mantle wedge , the bulk of the sulfur flux will likely consist of SO 2 or 1 4 0 0 °C 1 4 0 0 °C 60 0 °C 1 0 0 0 °C E c l o g i t e Sediment Metasomatized asthenosphere Fig . 1 .
Finally , partial melting of predominantly reduced , sulfide - rich crustal rocks in orogenic settings may lead to chalcophile element - depleted , but potentially lithophile element - rich S - type magmas ( see Section 2 . 6 ) .
However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .
Once these hybrid magmas andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .
Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .
Sources of metals
Behavior of metals
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .
Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .
Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .
In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .
Variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Blatter and Carmichael , 1998 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) will not greatly affect the potential to form synsubduction porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , but might control the Cu / HSE ratio in later magmas formed by post - subduction melting of these sulfide - bearing residues .
Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .
Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .
Consequently , the bulk of Cu - sulfide mineralization occurs at the low - temperature , late - stage end of the potassic alteration phase , just prior to the onset of phyllic alteration ( i . e . , corresponding to the " ore shell " of the classic Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 , porphyry Cu model ) .
The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
In contrast , at intermediate abundances of sulfide ( intermediate R - factor ) , only originally sparse HSE will show significant depletions .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
( For reviews of alkalic - type epithermal deposits , see Jensen andBarton , 2000 andRichards , 1995 ) .
( b - d ) During post - subduction tectonic processes , previously subduction - modified sub - continental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) or lower crustal hydrous cumulate zones residual from previous arc magmatism ( black layer ) may undergo small - volume partial melting .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .
In contrast , some porphyry Mo deposits are associated with felsic granitoids , derived primarily from melting of continental crust during intra - plate rifting events .
Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
old ) and therefore still hot oceanic crust , and Peacock et al . ( 1994 ) were even more restrictive ( b5 m . y .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .
Consequently , it is in collisional orogens such as the Neo - Tethyan belt of southeastern Europe and southern Asia that some of the clearest examples of post - subduction magmatism and mineralization are found .
Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .
Depths are indicated for hydrostatic ( hyd ) and lithostatic ( lith ) pressure conditions .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .
Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing temperature cause deposition of Cu and Mo ± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
The question of the source of various elements in convergent and collided margin magmas has challenged geologists for decades .
The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .
A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .
A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .
Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .
In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .
As discussed in Sections 2 . 1 . 1 and 2 . 5 . 1 , chalcophile and siderophile elements partition strongly into sulfide phases exsolving or crystallizing from silicate melts .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .
The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .
Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .
Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .
However , Dietrich et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested a possible role for mantle - derived magmas in triggering volatile ( and metal ) release from evolved , felsic magmas in the Bolivian tin belt , and Walshe et al . ( 2011 ) have identified a mantle Nd isotopic signature in tin granites from eastern Australia .
This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .
This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .
Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .
Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .
Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .
Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations , forming sulfur - undersaturated magmas that can further assimilate sulfides during ascent .
Sulfide formed during sulfate reduction is efficiently scavenged by aqueous fluids , which transports metals to shallower depths , i . e . , the top of the porphyry and superjacent wallrock .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .
Porphyry Cu and Au deposits almost do have systematically higher oxygen fugacities and FeO contents compared to other porphyry deposits ( i . e . , Cu - Mo and Mo ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
Gangue minerals include quartz , muscovite , chlorite , calcite , minor epidote and anhydrite .
Zircon grains from the Yulong ore - bearing porphyries have higher Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + values than those from barren porphyries in the region ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .
Porphyry Mo deposits generally have higher SiO 2 and lower FeO contents .
High Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios indicate very high oxygen fugacity , comparable to those of Chuquicamata ( Fig . 12 ) .
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .
Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 and ΔFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .
Sulfate reduction in hydrothermal fluids lowers the pH and consequently elevates the oxygen fugacity of the system up to the HM buffer .
Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Oxidized Mt Washington adakite was emplaced at 41 - 35 . 3 Ma during the subduction ridge , bringing more ore forming fluids into the Catface porphyry .
Oxidized adakitic rocks are overwhelmingly the most favorable candidates for porphyry mineralizations .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent by processes accompanying melting , crystallization , assimilation , degassing , etc ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 .
Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .
Thick continental arcs are more favorable for porphyry mineralization because of accumulation of copper - rich sulfide cumulates ; ( B ) after Wilkinson ( 2013 ) , which also proposes that sulfide saturation and accumulation are very important for the formation of porphyry Cu deposits ; ( C ) after Richards ( 2011b ) , illustrating porphyry and epithermal mineralizations in arc and postcollisional settings ; ( D ) after Richards ( 2013 ) , highlighting features or processes that may result in supercharging of these systems to form giant deposits .
Crystallization sulfide cannot explain this phenomenon , because Ni and Pt are even more chalcophile than Cu , with partition coefficients between sulfide and silicate melts of several hundreds and more than 20 thousand , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
Hydrothermal magnetite and even hematite may also form in fluids released from arc volcanic magmas , e . g . , Manus glasses , releasing H + .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
Partial melting of thickened eclogitic lower continental crust ( Wang et al . , 2006a ( Wang et al . , , b , 2007aZhang et al . , 2001a ) and fractional crystallization garnet ( Macpherson et al . , 2006 ) or amphibole ( Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) may also form high Sr / Y magmas .
High water contents in magmas may suppress the crystallization of plagioclase , and promote the formation of amphibole , resulting in high Sr / Y signatures ( Richards , 2011a ( Richards , , 2012 .
Oceanic crust has a much higher Cu abundance ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than the mantle ( 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) or the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Subduction of young ridges , both spreading and aseismic , in particular , produces adakites with high oxygen fugacity , making it the best geological process for porphyry Cu deposits ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
Alterations
Sodic calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits .
Dominant mineral changes from biotite in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , to K - feldspar in more granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration produces pale green rocks and is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , overprinting preexisting potassic assemblages .
Sulfate is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide .
Degassing is not the main process in deeply emplaced porphyry bodies , such that it is not likely to be a major process for sulfate reduction , either .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
Low pH fluids cause formation of pervasive alteration zones in porphyry Cu deposits , starting from barren , early sodic - calcic alteration upward through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alterations , to advanced argillic alterations , and finally forming the lithocaps .
At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 or higher , only 5 % partial melting is needed to remove all the residual sulfides , forming melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 2000 ppm .
At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
The heterogeneous deposit are attributed to significant country - rock contamination after emplacement ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) in an arc setting ( Shen et al . , 2013a , b ) .
The oxygen fugacity of the mantle and volcanic arc has been under study for a long time ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Cottrell and Kelley , 2013 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ) .
The solubility sulfides high , with partition coefficients of ~ 500 ( Keppler , 2010 ) .
The highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
A . Porphyry deposits are formed in normal arc rocks ( after Richards , 2011a ) .
The highly oxidized nature of porphyry magmas have been reported in essentially all types of porphyries ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ; , including porphyry Cu Cu - Au deposits ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , porphyry Au deposits , to porphyry Cu - Mo deposits ( Cuadra and Rojas , 2001 ; Lynch and Ortega , 1997 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) and pure porphyry Fig . 6 .
The Tongshankou porphyry skarn Cu - Au deposit , in the Lower Yangtze River belt , central eastern China , also has primary hematite next to sulfides ( Li et al . , 2008 ) .
The most famous porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are the Cenozoic ones located along the eastern Pacific margin .
The porphyry is an adakite formed at ~ 170 Ma ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2006a , b ) .
The Yulong porphyry is the largest one in the Yulong copper deposit belt , with reserves of N7 . 14 Mt of Cu @ 0 . 84 % and 0 . 15 Mt of Mo @ 0 . 028 % ( Table 1 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
The oxygen fugacity can also reach the HM buffer during sulfate reduction and mineralization ( Fig . 10 ) , likely because of the lower FeO contents .
The oxygen fugacities of convergent margin magmas are systematically higher than those of intraplate settings .
The oxidation of ferrous iron by sulfate leads to a decreases in pH in ore - forming fluids within the porphyry system ( Eq .
The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .
The resulting adakites may then have been reduced through reaction with the thick ( maximum thickness of 4 km ) carbon - rich Cretaceous Nanaimo Group sediments ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) as they migrated upward .
The Baogutu adakites have been attributed to the mixing of ~ 95 % slab melt with 5 % sediment derived melt in the Late Carboniferous close to a subducting spreading ridge ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) .
The magnetite crisis refers to the dramatic decreases in Cu and Au during magnetite crystallization in arc volcanic rocks ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is a common phenomenon ( Moss et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Togashi and Terashima , 1997 ) .
The sulfide phase contains high Au and Ag contents in addition to Cu in sulfides , but no other chalcophile elements Ni , Re , and Pt .
The chalcopyrite ± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones .
The alteration is characterized by transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
The sericitic alteration is commonly pyrite dominated , implying effective removal of the Cu ( ± Au ) present in the former chlorite - sericite and / or potassic assemblages .
The advanced argillic alteration preferentially affects lithologic units with low acid - buffering capacities ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
This oxygen buffer technique was first developed by Eugster in 1957 to prevent oxidation iron during growth of hydrous ferrous silicates and then later to determine the stability of annite ( Eugster , 1957 ; Eugster and Wones , 1962 ; Wones and Eugster , 1965 ) .
Many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have high sulfate contents , with much less magnetite .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
These Cu - rich sulfides may evolve into porphyry mineralization or even control the ore - forming process .
These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
These ridges were mostly younger 25 Ma when they began to subduct , and are closely associated with large porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 27 ) .
How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
Why are porphyry deposits usually associated with oxidized magmas , which is a situation so different from Ni–Cu sulﬁde deposits that clearly experienced sulﬁde saturation ?
For the mantle wedge subducting slabs , the estimated S content at sulfide saturation ranges from 1500 ppm ( at ΔFMQ + 0 . 4 ) to 4500 ppm ( at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
2014 ) : Mantle derived magmas ( red ) intrude into the cold upper plate ( black ) of subduction zones , generating crystallizing magma chambers .
Although reduced porphyry deposits are rare , with tonnages much smaller than oxidizing porphyry deposits ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , the mechanism needs to be clariﬁed .
( 11 ) , degassing of SO 2 indeed consumes oxygen , such that it may lower the oxygen fugacity of the system .
Although most of the porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas , a small group of porphyry deposits are reported as apparently related to reduced magmas with oxygen fugacities ranging from ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Fig . 19 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The final porphyry mineralization is controlled by sulfate reduction , which is usually initiated by magnetite crystallization , accompanied by decreasing pH and correspondingly increasing oxidation potential of sulfate .
However , degassing of SO 2 cannot reduce Fig . 16 .
Given that volcanic systems are far more open , the initial Cu , Au contents are not of critical importance to porphyry mineralization .
There are porphyry ore deposits located at the southwestern Pacific margin , which , however , are much less developed in terms of tonnage and the number deposits .
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .
Given that porphyry magmas highly oxidized , reaction ( 21 ) is not likely to occur .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Many large porphyry Cu - Au deposits are connected to subduction aseismic ridges ( Fig . 27 ) ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Therefore , degassing of SO 2 cannot explain the features of reduced porphyries .
Therefore , Cu , Mo and Au act as moderately incompatible ele - ments ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , which become enriched during the early stage of magma evolution , and suddenly go into magmatic ﬂuids during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013a ) .
First , the oxygen fugacity Ni - NiO is quite close to the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of the hydrothermal vessel ( NiNiO + 0 . 5 ) .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
Meanwhile , sulfide is kept undersaturated during the evolution of the oxidized magma , such that no sulfide segregation occurs , and Cu , Mo , and Au act as moderately incompatible elements .
The further oxidation of magnetite is controlled by the pH values of the system ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Most of the C in magma occurs as CO 2 , therefore the oxygen buffer changes from graphite - CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + Fe 2 + equilibria as the magma ascends ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .
All types of porphyry deposits , ranging from Cu + Au deposits , may be oxidized sufficiently to reach the redox states of the HM buffer .
Although the tonnages oxidized porphyry deposits , the mechanism that controls these mineralization process needs to be clarified .
However , at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , ~ 5 - 10 % of partial melting is enough to eliminate residual sulfide from the subducted oceanic crust , forming adakitic melts with high Cu S contents up to 2000 ppm and percent levels , respectively .
The amount of H + released during mineralization and the alkali content in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation alterations .
The supergiant El Teniente deposit in Chile is the largest porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit in the world , with total reserves of ~ 109 Mt Cu @0 . 92 % , 2 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 02 % and 437 t Au @0 . 035 g / t ( Table 1 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
For example , ilmenite is an end - member of the hematite - ilmenite solid solutions with a very low hematite component , varying from X Hem ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 ) , for the Catface phase and X Hem ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 09 ) for the Hecate Bay phase ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
First , lower Cu and Au contents would first result in lower grade , not necessarily smaller tonnages .
We infer that large proportions adakites are still buried due to the dramatically lessened compression , uplifting and erosion following ridge subduction .
In contrast , oceanic crust has sulfur abundances of over 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , which is about 4 times greater than the primitive mantle value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control K + / H + ratio magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .
Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .
Stability domains of trisulfur ion S 3 − at total dissolved sulfur concentrations of 1 wt . % and 0 . 1 wt . % are shown .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bΔFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ΔFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .
This is likely due to a lowering pH as mineralization continues .
The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .
Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ΔFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayalite–magnetite– quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
Therefore , small amount of reduced gases fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature of the magmas .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .
As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .
Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .
It has long been proposed that most porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013b , also known as the magnetite - series magmas ( Ishihara and Terashima , 1989 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction of S 3 − ( Eq .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
( 3 ) What is the genetic connection between high oxygen fugacity magmas and porphyry deposits ?
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .
Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea floor degassing .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .
It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
Basic principles of isotope geochemistry dictate instead that in degassing , i . e . , evaporating , the remaining liquid becomes isotopically heavier in H and O .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .
For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Hydrothermal mineralization can cause enrichment or depletion of elements in ore bodies and surrounding country rocks .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
In D - type veins the values of the parameter τ ( 1 . 5 ) ( correspond to third positive moment in Figures 6 , 7 and 8 ) is lower for Cu , Fe and S compared to other elements considered in this study ( Table 2 and Tables Table 1 .
The multifractal distributions of concentration of chemical elements on the surface of pyrite crystals selected from veins of different types were investigated using digital images generated by means of ESEM .
The local variability of hydrothermal mineralization can result in element concentration enrichment or depletion , and locally metal enriched rocks can become mineable ore bodies .
The total width or aperture ( ∆α = α q - - α q + ) of f ( α ) spectrum reflects the enrichment in concentration of elements in local space .
The chlorite + illite alteration transitional and characterized by B - type veins .
For pyrite from the same mineralization stage , different samples show more or less different trace element distributions and even a single pyrite crystal may contain different levels of trace elements .
The ∆α and ∆αL values for the elements higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .
Local metal enriched rocks can become an ore body that can be mined at an economic profit .
Therefore , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising to discriminate between mineralized veins developed during different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body .
The values of the asymmetry index negative indicating that the widths of the left part of f ( α ) spectrum are in all cases less than the widths of the right part .
It is calculated as : R α = ( ∆α L - ∆α R ) / ( ∆α L + ∆α R ) ( Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2010b ) .
Many authors have studied ore deposits ore body scales ( e . g .
To 1 achieve our goal , the distribution patterns of element concentration values of eight elements ( Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si and Ti ) on the pyrite surface selected from B - type , D - type and H - type veins and veinlets were represented by multifractal spectra .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution element concentration depletion caused by hydrothermal mineralization is of great importance for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
To achieve this objective , the distribution Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
To achieve this objective , the distribution Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
These samples were analyzed using transmitted and reflected light microscopy , XRD and ESEM .
A recently developed extension of the monofractal approach describes the data with a set of intertwining fractals of different fractal dimensions ( Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Cheng and Agterberg , 1996 ; Cheng , 1999 ; Agterberg , 2001b ; Panahi and Cheng , 2004 ) .
Based on this shape characterization , the multifractal distribution can be divided into two groups , one is the left - deviation ( ∆α L ) continuous multifractal mode , and the other is the right - deviation mode ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) .
As can be seen in Table 2 and Figures 9 and 10 , the multifractal parameters created on the basis of element distribution values on mineral surfaces are not the same .
Based on the analytical results and previous investigations , the vein systems within the deposit can be divided into four main types as follows : ( 1 ) early quartz veins ( A - type veins ) related to K - feldspar alteration ; ( 2 ) quartz - pyrite - molybdenite - chalcopyrite veins ( B - type veins ) related to chlorite + illite alteration ; ( 3 ) quartz - pyrite - chalcopyrite veins ( D - type veins ) related to late phyllic alteration ; and ( 4 ) the latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ( H - type veins ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low - quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO 4 , Fe , and associated metal ( loid ) s . Acid generated during the oxidation of pyrite [ FeS 2 ] , pyrrhotite S ] and other sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .
Mining and processing of sulfide ores generates large volumes of waste materials that can have severe and widespread impacts on water resources ( España et al . , 2005 ; Concas et al . , 2006 ; Moncur et al . , 2006 , 2014 ; Pérez - López et al . , 2011 ) .
Anionic surfactants commonly used for sulfide flotation include xanthates and dithiophosphates .
Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of Fe - and S - oxidizing bacteria .
The pH drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .
Acid generation associated with this process is neutralized in the presence of carbonate minerals to maintain circumneutral pH conditions .
The fine - grained slurry is then introduced to aerated flotation cells where a frothing agent is added to promote bubble formation .
These tailings are generally characterized by elevated concentrations of weakly hydrolyzing metals including Fe ( II ) , Zn and Cd , and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Se , and Sb .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation ( redox ) , and sorption - desorption reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
The extent of acid neutralization and , therefore , pore - water pH is a principal control on the mobility of sulfide - oxidation products within tailings deposits .
Production of H2S via sulfate reduction can promote precipitation of sparingly soluble metal - sulfide phases , whereas reduction of As ( V ) to As ( III ) typically enhances As mobility .
Cemented layers of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide and ( hydroxy ) sulfate minerals , referred to as hardpans , may promote attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products within and below the oxidation zone .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
The transport and attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products are influenced by precipitation - dissolution , sorption - desorption , and redox reactions .
Understanding the dynamics of these interrelated geochemical and mineralogical processes is critical for anticipating and managing water quality associated with sulfide mine tailings . Geochemistry and mineralogy of sulfide mine tailings are reviewed Case studies highlight metal ( loid ) release , transport and attenuation processes Interactions among chemical , biological and physical processes are complex Effective tailings management requires comprehensive understanding of processes

The extent of environmental impacts associated with sulfide tailings deposits depends upon their mineralogical and geochemical composition , and upon in - situ chemical processes .
Fuerstenau et al . ( 2007 ) present a comprehensive review of sulfide mineral flotation .
These three case studies provide valuable insights into a range of geochemical and mineralogical aspects of sulfide mine tailings .
These and other studies discussed in this review highlight the complex array of geochemical and mineralogical processes that occur within sulfide tailings deposits .
Several comprehensive reviews of geochemical ( Blowes et al . , 6 2003 ; Blowes et al . , 2014 ) , mineralogical ( Alpers et al . , 1994a ; Jambor , 1994 , 2003 ; Jambor and Blowes , 1998 ) , microbiological ( Gould et al . , 1994 ; Nordstrom and Southam , 1997 ; Gould and Kapoor , 2003 ; Johnson and Hallberg , 2003 ; Nordstrom , 2003 ) and hydrogeological ( Blowes et al . , 2003 ; Robertson , 1994 ) aspects of sulfide mine tailings and resulting mine drainage have been published over the past two decades .
Metasomatized mantle lithosphere or hydrous lower crustal cumulates residual from ﬁ rst - stage arc magmatism contain small amounts of chalcophile and siderophile element– rich sulﬁ des , and constitute a fertile source for hydrous , Au - rich magmas during later remelting .
The majority of known deposits are genetically related to intermediate to felsic calcalkaline magmas in volcanoplutonic arcs above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1A ) .
Mixing and differentiation of these melts forms hybrid calc - alkaline magmas , with low enough density that they can ascend into the upper crust .
Magmas processed through these lower crustal MASH zones commonly display relatively high La / Yb ratios due to the suppression of early plagioclase crystallization and the preferential partitioning of Y and middle and heavy rare earth elements into amphibole and garnet ( Green and Pearson , 1985 ) .
Translithospheric extensional structures provide channelways for rapid ascent of mantlederived magmas to upper crustal levels , with little crustal interaction ( Richards et al . , 1990 ) .
Contractional Environments and Porphyry Cu - Au Deposits
The porphyry deposits in these settings closely resemble those from subduction - related arcs , except for a relationship to mildly alkaline intrusions , and a tendency to be relatively Au rich and Mo poor .
Arc magmas , although sulfur rich , are also relatively oxidized , such that the bulk of the sulfur is present as SO 2 dissolved in the magma ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Postsubduction magmatism resulting from lithospheric thickening , thermal rebound , mantle lithosphere delamination , or lithospheric exten - sion shares many geochemical characteristics with subduction - related calc - alkaline magmatism , but tends to be more alka - line ( shoshonitic , hawaiitic ) , less sulfur rich , and more isolated in distribution and timing .
Such magmas will have the potential to form porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits .
Such magmas are derived by remelting of the meta somatized roots of former arc magmatic systems , from which they inherit their arc metal endowment .
Thus , postsubduction magmatism tends to be spatially isolated , and mildly ( high - K ± Na calcalkaline ) to strongly alkaline in character .
Although magmas with these characteristics most commonly form directly in response to inputs from the subduction zone , it is also possible to extract compositionally similar magmas from upper plate lithosphere that has been modifi ed by prior subduction processes , but with melting caused by later postsubduction events ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ) .
In contrast , postsubduction arc contraction caused by collision may lead to crustal thickening and delamination of the SCLM , with partial melting occurring in depressed lower crustal rocks as isotherms rebound or hot asthenospheric melts invade ( Figs . 1B and 1C ) .
The presence of amphibole and / or garnet in the lower crustal former arc source rocks may accentuate the high Sr / Y and La / Yb signatures of these magmas , leading to their ( mis - ) identifi cation as adakites in some cases .
If this fertile , hydrous residue is subjected to a second stage of melting , either by invasion of small volumes of hot , oxidized asthenospheric magma , or thermal rebound after lithospheric thickening ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) , then Au - rich residual sulfide phases may redissolve ( R ≥ 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) to generate magmas high Au / Cu ratios ( Solomon , 1990 ; Richards , 2005 ) and perhaps also PGE enrichments ( cf .
It is proposed that these deposits were formed from hydrous magmas derived by partial remelting of the metasomatized lithospheric roots and hydrous cumulate zones of former arc systems , in response to a variety of mechanisms such as lithospheric thickening and thermal rebound , subcontinental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) delamination , or lithospheric extension ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) .
The recognition that porphyry Cu - Au and related epithermal Au systems can also form in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings expands the range of geological environments and geographical terranes that are prospective for such deposits .
Examples include the Porgera and Ladolam ( Papua New Guinea ; Richards et al . , 1990 ; Müller et al . , 2002 ) , Emperor ( Fiji ; Eaton and Setterfi eld , 1993 ) , and Cripple Creek gold deposits .
Recently , a number of porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits have been described in association with such magmas , with ages and from locations that are incompatible with a relationship to contemporaneous subduction , but consistent with postsubduction tectonic settings .
All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
Because of their sparsity ( under the relatively oxidizing but S - rich conditions of arc mag - matism ) , these sulﬁ de phases will be enriched in Au and other highly siderophile elements .
Late - stage partition - ing of these metals into hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved during cooling and crystallization of this magma at upper crustal levels generates magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits superﬁ - cially similar to arc - related porphyry and epi - thermal deposits , but more enriched in Au and of generally lower sulﬁ dation state .
) , with essentially instantaneous cessation of arc volcanism ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ) .
However , because of the transience of these events ( compared with steady - state subduction ) , the magmas will be formed in relatively small volumes and at relatively low degrees of partial melting ( Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) .
In both cases ( extension or contraction ) , the source region is previously subduction - modifi ed lithosphere ± asthenosphere , and the postsubduction magmas therefore share many of the geo chemical characteristics of the pre ceding arc magmatism .

Volatile ( mainly water ) contents were likely increased in the residual melts via magmatic differentiation and / or via mafic magma replenishments .
The Late Triassic Pulang intrusive complex comprises five phase of porphyrtic stocks and dikes ( ca .
( 3 ) Two kinds of amphibole with different Al2O3 contents are identified at Pulang , which were likely crystallized in the deeper ( 11 – 18 km ) and shallower part of the magma chambers , respectively .
Both the intrusive complex and the related volcanic wall rocks have similar PGE concentrations , Pd / Pt ratios and primitive mantle - normalized PGE patterns , indicating that no discernible Two types of amphibole , i . e . , high - Al ( Al2O3 = 9 . 4 – 11 . 8 wt . % ) and low - Al ( 5 . 9 – 7 . 3 wt . % ) types , have been identified in the Pulang complex .
) , and was more oxidized ( NNO + 1 . 0 – NNO + 1 . 7 ) with a low H2O content ( 4 . 2 – 4 . 9 wt . % ) .
Consequently , large amounts of Cu - rich sulfides accumulated there may have been remobilized and contributed to later porphyry - related metallogenic event ( s ) ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2017 ) .
Meanwhile , the melts equilibrated with the low - Al amphibole were likely more oxidized ( NNO + 1 . 0 – NNO + 1 . 7 ) but with lower H2O content ( 4 . 2– 4 . 9 wt . % ) .
In addition , the higher H2O content may have enhanced volatile exsolution from the 2 evolving magmas at Pulang .
We propose that the Pulang magma did not undergo early sulfide removal , and that the magma was likely sulfide - unsaturated during its emplacement .
geochemistry of the giant Pulang porphyry Cu - Au system in the Sanjiang Region , SW China .
Therefore , we propose that the parental magmas of the Pulang complex may have formed by mixing of two magmas , as supported by the wide variation range of plagioclase phenocryst ( An6 – An60 ; Fig . 7 ) and amphibole ( Fig . 9 ) compositions .
Furthermore , as reflected by the low - Al amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) , the inferred H2Omelt content decreased ( < 4 . 9 wt . % ) with increasing oxygen fugacity ( > NNO + 1 . 0 ) .
Sun et al . ( 2017 ) also suggested that such Cu pre - enrichment through sulfide saturation is not a prerequisite for generating large porphyry Cu deposits .
On the other hand , the geometry ( i . e . , curvature ) of the εHf ( t ) vs . δ18O arrays can be used to constraint the relative Hf isotope compositions of the end - members ( e . g . , Kemp et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
This , however , does not support a co - magmatic origin , because no enrichments in incompatible elements were found in the volcanic rocks over the intrusive rocks , and both rock types are mafic than the intrusive rocks ( Fig . 10 ) , precluding the third model .
Although these two amphibole types contain different water contents ( Fig . 14c ) , both were crystallized from oxidized magmas ( > NNO + 0 . 2 ) , as also supported by the large amount of magnetite observed .
Local metal enriched rocks can become an ore body that can be mined at an economic profit .
Late alteration and mineralization are characterized muscovite + quartz alteration and is related to D - type veins .
The Cu concentration in D - type vein pyrite is higher than that in pyrite from other veins and veinlets .
Several multifractal parameters were calculated , however , the most significant ones are ∆α and ∆αL .
The local variability of hydrothermal mineralization can result in element concentration enrichment or depletion , and locally metal enriched rocks can become mineable ore bodies .
Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
Other important methods include analysis of frequency distributions and spatial correlation of element concentration values .
The rock samples were collected at different localities from veins within hydrothermal systems of the Dexing porphyry copper deposit ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
The ∆α and ∆αL values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .
Hence , in this study , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising parameters to discriminate between mineralized veins developed at different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body of the Dexing Porphyry copper Deposit .
Least - altered samples from the Yulong intrusion have high SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) and Al2O3 ( 14 . 9–15 . 5 wt % ) contents , high La / Yb ( 36 . 4–68 . 0 ) and Sr / Y 1 / 58 Journal Pre - proof ( 46 . 0–76 . 3 ) ratios , and low MgO ( 0 . 63–1 . 24 wt % ) and Cr ( < 30 ppm ) contents , similar to adakitic rocks deriving from thick juvenile lower crust .
Least - altered samples from the Yulong intrusion have high SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) and Al2O3 ( 14 . 9–15 . 5 wt % ) contents , high La / Yb ( 36 . 4–68 . 0 ) and Sr / Y 1 / 58 Journal Pre - proof ( 46 . 0–76 . 3 ) ratios , and low MgO ( 0 . 63–1 . 24 wt % ) and Cr ( < 30 ppm ) contents , similar to adakitic rocks deriving from thick juvenile lower crust .
Magmatic water decrease from early - ( 3 . 5–4 . 6 wt % ) to late - stage ( 2 . 8–3 . 5 wt % ) amphibole , which is interpreted to indicate fluid exsolution from the magma chamber during emplacement of the Yulong intrusion .
Porphyry Cu deposits are typically developed in oceanic slab subduction - related magmatic arcs ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 1972 , 2010 ) , and are genetically related to partial melting of the subduction - metasomatized asthenosphere mantle wedge ( Richards , 2003 , 2011 ) .
Fluid exsolution in the magma chamber The early - stage amphibole phenocrysts from Yulong have higher crystallization Journal Pre - proof pressures and temperatures than the late - stage amphibole grains , suggesting that they crystalized at deeper depth before the crystallization of low - Al amphiboles ( Fig . 12B ) .
The periodic changes in magma compositions are most possibly resulted from pulsed recharge of the magma chamber by a less evolved magma ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Andrews et al . , 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .
The ancient crustal component is probably metasedimentary rocks , as suggested by the elevated zircon δ18O ( > 7 . 8‰ ) values ( Figs . 8D and 9A ) .
The oxidation states are relatively high ( ΔNNO > 0 . 6 ) , and increase through magma evolution .
These Sr - Nd - Hf - O isotopes , in combined with the high whole - rock SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) contents and La / Yb ratios ( 36 . 4–68 . 0 ) , low Cr ( < 30ppm ) contents , and the arc - like trace element patterns , suggest that the 25 / 58 In summary , the magma chamber beneath Yulong might have been recharged by a compositionally less evolved magma , and was saturated in magmatic fluid before or coeval with the emplacement of the Yulong stock in the magma chamber .
These Hf isotopes and model ages overlap those of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related arc 20 / 58 Journal Pre - proof magmas in the north Qiangtang terrane ( Fig . 10 ; Zi et al . , 2012b ) .
The above Sr - Nd - Hf isotopes , together with the elevated zircon δ18O values ( 6 . 4 to 9 . 3‰ ) and arc - like trace element patterns , collectively suggest that the Yulong intrusion may have originated from partial Journal Pre - proof melting of juvenile lower arc crust related to the subduction of the Paleo - Tethys ocean , Journal Pre - proof oxidation states increase from early - ( ΔNNO = 0 . 6–1 . 5 ) to late - stage ( ΔNNO = 1 . 9–2 . 3 ) amphibole .
Mixing of ancient crustal components could have happened in the source , or by magma mixing during emplacement .
Origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains a matter of debate .
It has been The Yulong intrusion has broadly similar zircon U - Pb ages ( ~ 41 . 0 Ma ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Huang et al . , 2019b ) and geochemical features with the alkaline felsic magmatic rocks along the strike - slip faults in eastern Tibet and western Yunnan ( i . e .
Furthermore , the Yulong intrusion has mainly elevated zircon δ18O values of 6 . 4 to 7 . 6‰ ( Figs . 8D and 9A ; average = 7 . 0 ± 0 . 5‰ , 2σ , n = 79 ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant zircon εHf ( t ) and δ18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant between zircon εHf ( t ) and δ18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust partial melting .
The depleted source of the Yulong intrusion is probably a juvenile mafic lower arc crust , as suggested by the arc - like trace element patterns ( Fig . 7A - B ) and positive zircon Hf isotopes and young Hf mantle model ages ( Figs . 8C , and 10 ) .
It has been suggested that the Yulong intrusion originated directly from low - degree partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or formed by assimilation - fractional crystallization ( AFC ) of 19 / 58 Journal Pre - proof metasomatized mantle - derived melts ( Hou et al . , 2003 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .
Recent studies have shown that the postsubduction tectonic settings , such as the Miocene Gangdese belt and the Eocene Yulong belt in eastern Tethys domain , could also form porphyry Cu deposits ( Hou et al . , 2004 , 2011 , 2013 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ; Deng et al . , 2014 , 2017 ) .
Journal Pre - proof Journal Pre - proof Yulong intrusion may have originated from concurrent partial melting of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related juvenile lower arc crust and a small amount of ancient crustal materials .
An alternative explanation for origin of the Yulong intrusion is the fractional crystallization of a mantle - derived mafic magma .
Several models have been proposed to account for the paragenesis of these postsubduction porphyry deposits , which include partial melting of the lithosphere mantle that was metasomatized by previous slab - derived melts / fluids ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Gao et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ) , partial melting of the subducted oceanic slab ( Hu et al . , 2015a ) , and partial melting of lower crustal cumulates of early arc magmas ( juvenile lower arc crust ) ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004 , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 , 2015 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .

Topographic and thermal anomalies on the downgoing slab appear to act as tectonic triggers for porphyry ore formation .
Tectonic Afghanistan , and surrounding regions .
Ore grades are also partly dependent on the structure ( permeability architecture ) of the district ( leaky versus focused hydrothermal fluid - flow regimes ) , and formation and preservation of supergene enrichment blankets can also be critical to high - grade ore formation .
Hypogene ore grades , in contrast , appear to be controlled mostly by factors that operated at the district and deposit scales .
The deposits are characterized by low - grade copper , gold , and / or molybdenum mineralization developed within and around a porphyritic intrusive complex .
For the Iran - Pakistan segment of the Tethyan belt , it is difficult to comment on the plate architecture and geodynamics at the time of ore formation , and a similar problem exists for Frieda River on mainland Papua New Guinea , which formed at 13 . 6 to 11 . 5 Ma ( Table 2 ) , making it significantly older than the interaction of the Eupirik Rise with the New Guinea trench .
The 25 largest gold - rich porphyry deposits are concentrated in the southwest Pacific and South America , with other occurrences in Eurasia , British Columbia , Alaska , and New South Wales .
Seven of the 25 giant copper and 13 of the 25 giant gold - rich porphyry deposits considered in this review formed in the last 20 m . y .
The largest of the deposits are associated with high K calc - alkalic intrusions .
He inferred that the flat slab was related to an elongate swell and associated oceanic plateau related to the ancestral Yellowstone hot spot .
In several examples , these tectonic perturbations have promoted flat - slab subduction , crustal thickening , uplift and erosion , and adakitic magmatism coeval with the formation of well - endowed porphyry and / or epithermal mineral provinces .
Although not discussed here , sutures in the overriding plate obviously play vital roles in focusing magmatism and fluid flow ( e . g . , Richards , 2000 , 2003 ; Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Of these , six of the seven giant copper and nine of the 13 giant gold deposits are known or inferred to be associated with regions where low - angle subduction of aseismic ridges , 814 COOKE ET AL .
They are most commonly discovered in continental and oceanic arcs of Tertiary and Quaternary age , notably around the Pacific Rim , but they have also been discovered in ancient fold belts .
This period spans the formation of the Eocene to Oligocene porphyry province of northern Chile , the most productive on Earth in terms of copper content ( Camus , 2002 ) .
Murphy ( 2001 ) argued that the Laramide orogeny in the southwest United States was associ - ated with flat - slab subduction , because it was characterized by an absence of volcanism , widespread hinterland deforma - tion , and thick - skinned tectonics .
A number of factors may play a role in the formation of porphyry systems during ridge subduction .
Some papers in this special issue investigate processes of mineralization and alteration within individual ore systems ( e . g . , Cannell et al . , 2005 ; Davidson et al . , 2005 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Prendergast et al . , 2005 ) .
Similarly , as discussed above , James and Sacks ( 1999 ) argued that southern Peru and northern Chile was the site of flat - slab subduction from 50 to 30 Ma .
Whereas the total metal endowment may relate to these large - scale processes , the ore grades relate mainly to the hypogene ore - forming processes operating at the trap site .
Scope of this Issue This issue of Economic Geology reports the results of new research into the characteristics and origins of porphyry cop - per - molybdenum and copper - gold deposits of Chile , Ar - gentina , and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya .
High magmatic water contents are a prerequisite for the shallow crustal emplacement of arc magmas and the subsequent generation of potentially ore - forming subvolcanic magmatic - hydrothermal systems .
Intrusive rocks associated with porphyry Cu deposits in three separate segments of Neo - Tethyan arcs in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan display similar temporal characteristics when compared with earlier , barren volcanoplutonic suites from the same regions .
Porphyry - related magmas are typically relatively evolved , medium - to high - K calc - alkaline andesites - dacites or diorites - granodiorites .
Porphyry deposits may form at subvolcanic levels as a consequence of volatile exsolution from these batholithic magma chambers and the focusing of fluid flow through narrow cupola zones .
If this flux of hot magma is maintained , then a large magma complex develops at the base of the crust ( the MASH zone ) , in which fractionation of the mafic magma and mixing with partial melts of crustal lithologic units gives rise to evolved , hybrid , calc - alkaline intermediate composition magmas , whose lower density allows them to rise into the upper crust .
Fertile plutonic suites in continental arcs may be recognized by their relatively late timing with respect to voluminous plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric andesitic volcanism , the widespread presence of hornblende phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and trace element compositions featuring relatively high La / Yb ratios , and lack of negative Eu anomalies ( reflecting hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization ) .
Many of these deposits are relatively small , but larger porphyry deposits include Roşia Montanȃ ( Romania ; Manske et al . , 2006 ) , Bor and Majdanpek ( Serbia ; Ciobanu et al . , 2002 ; Lips et al . , 2004 ) , Chelopech ( Bulgaria ; Moritz et al . , 2005 ) , Çöpler ( Turkey ; Imer et al . , 2010 ) , Sungun ( Iran ; Hezarkhani , 2006 ) , Sari Gunay ( Iran ; Richards et al . , 2006 ) , Sar Cheshmeh ( Iran ; Waterman and Hamilton , 1975 ) , Saindak ( Pakistan ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ) , Reko Diq ( Pakistan ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ) , and Qulong ( Tibet ; Hou et al . , 2009 ) .
In all cases , a long - lived , mature arc setting is required for these fertile magmatic characteristics to be developed .
Together , these petrologic behaviors result in porphyryrelated rocks having relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which some have misinterpreted as a source characteristic arising from melting subducted oceanic crust ( i . e . , adakites ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Omrani et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .
Nevertheless , a large deposit is unlikely to form without these underlying precursors .
Conversely , relatively dry magmas formed during early stages of arc evolution tend not to stall in the upper crust , but erupt effusively and do not generate large magmatic - hydrothermal systems or porphyry deposits .
Compared with earlier barren volcanoplutonic rocks , the porphyry - related suites are characterized geochemically by : relatively high La / Yb ratios , which increase with SiO 2 ( where trends are visible ) ; minimal europium anomalies ( Eu n / Eu * ≈ 1 ) ; and light REE enrichments , but flat to concave - upward ( listric - shaped ) MREE - HREE patterns , reflected in [ La / Sm ] n ≈ 4 - 8 and [ Dy / Yb ] n ≈ 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 .
Reliable isochrons are based on the MSWD criteria of Wendt and Carl ( 1991 ) and , as for plateaus , must comprise contiguous steps and a significant fraction of the total gas released .
It is thus suggested that the fertility of arc magmas within a given arc terrane can be assessed by observing the relative timing of plutonic suites ( later suites are more prospective ) , noting the common presence of hornblende or biotite phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and through lithogeochemical fingerprinting of magmatic fractionation processes ( relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , and Eun / Eu * ratios ≈ 1 , indicating abundant early hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization in hydrous magmas ) .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of their host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
This process reflects the progressive interaction of hot hydrous asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived basaltic arc magmas with the upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the base of the upper plate crust , where these invading magmas stall due to their high density ( relative to crustal rocks ) .
A similar temporal relationship is observed in other major porphyry districts worldwide , such as northern and central Chile , Perú , northwest Argentina , and southwestern United States ( Richards , 2003 ; Halter et al . , 2004 Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) .
In further contrast , in western Pakistan subduction of Arabian Sea crust beneath the Makran accretionary complex continues today , as evidenced by Pliocene - Quaternary calc - alkaline volcanism in the Chagai arc .
Total gas ( integrated ) ages are calculated by weighting by the amount of 39 Ar released , whereas plateau ages are weighted by the inverse of the variance .
Irradiated FC - 2 sanidine standards together with CaF2 and K - glass fragments were placed in a Cu sample tray in a high vacuum extraction line and were fused using a 20 W CO2 laser .
Porphyry deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB ) Porphyry deposits constitute one of the world’s major sources of Cu and Au and are a major exploration target due to the high de - mand for these resources ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Subduction and arc building activity on the Paleo - Pacific Ocean margin continued to the Mid Mesozoic as the Indo - Sinian orogenic cycles ( Seltmann and Porter , 2005 , and references cited therein ) .
Porphyry deposits in the Tethyan Eurasian Orogenic Belt ( TEOB )
Porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in this sector are related to Neo - Tethyan subduction .
The Mesozoic ( Yanshanian ) metallogenic province in East China , as a part of the western Circum - Pacific metallogenic belt , extends inland for more than 1000 km from the eastern margin of continental China ( Mao et al . , 2011a ) .
The porphyry Cu - Au systems in pullapart volcanic - sedimentary basins in the eastern continental margin of China can be ascribed to large - scale lithospheric thinning , delamination and thermal erosion triggered by the changing direction of the Paleo - Pacific plate from oblique to parallel to the continent margin ( Mao et al . , 2007 ( Mao et al . , , 2008 ( Mao et al . , , 2010 ( Mao et al . , , 2013Goldfarb et al . , 2007Goldfarb et al . , , 2013 .
The porphyry Cu - Au deposits and related granitic rocks are associated with residual subducted slab fragments ( Mao et al . , 2011a ( Mao et al . , , c , 2013 .
The magmas associated with these Cu - Au ( Mo ) deposits show both island arc and continental arc - related geochemical signatures and include alkalic compositions , and share similarity with the Skouries porphyry in Greece .
The convergence of the Afro - Arabian plate with Central Iran crustal thickening generated a fertile , metallogenic environment with abundant Miocene porphyry Cu deposits in the Kerman belt ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .
The ore formation ages of these porphyry Mo deposits range from 65 to 51 Ma ( Gao et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) .
The Three River porphyry Cu belt comprises the Triassic porphyry Cu - Au deposits of the Zhongdian magmatic arc , and the Jinshajiang - Red River Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo deposit belt associated with alkaline igneous rocks .
The Zhongdian magmatic arc is also a significant Triassic porphyry - skarn Cu district in China , hosting several major deposits Pulang , Chundu , Xuejiping , as well as several smaller and sub - economic occurrences ( Li , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Peng et al . , 2013Peng et al . , , 2014 .
The partial melting hydrated mantle wedge or subducted oceanic slab largely metasomatized and transformed the arc lithosphere during a long subduction - related tectonic process .
Both porphyry Cu - Mo ( Au ) and porphyry Mo deposits are common in East China .
Major Cu - Au porphyry deposits are distributed over an interval of almost 5000 km across central Eurasia , from the Urals Mountains in Russia in the west , though the Central Asian countries , Mongolia , Xinjiang ( NW China ) , Inner Mongolia and Northeast China to the east ( Seltmann et al . , 2013 ( Seltmann et al . , , 2014Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .
These magmas are typically calc - alkaline to high - K calc - alkaline ( Heinrich and Neubaner , 2002 ) .
In the Eurasian continent there are three huge metallogenic belts Cu and Mo porphyry deposits , comprising the Paleozoic Central Asian Ore Belt in the north , the Tethyan Eurasian Ore Belt of Jurassic to Cenozoic age in the southwest , and the East Margin Ore Belt of the Eurasian Continent of Jurassic to Cretaceous age in the east .
By the Mid to Late Permian , as the Kazakh Orocline had continued to develop , both the Sakmara and Khanty - Mansi back - arc basins closed and the collage cratons and arcs was sutured by accretionary complexes .
In the Pontides - Caucasus sector there are many base , rare metal deposits , but typical porphyry Cu deposits are relatively rare ( e . g . , Kisladag and Copler ; Jankovic , 1977 ; Yigit , 2009 ; Fig . 1 ) .
During the mid - Paleozoic , the two main cratonic components of the proto - Asian continent , the Siberian and Eastern European cratons ( Fig . 2 ) , began to rotate relative to each other , ' ' drawing - in ' ' the two sets of parallel arcs to form the Kazakh Orocline between the two cratons .
Until now , porphyry Cu - Au deposits have been explored in the western part of the belt , covering an area of 600 km 2 , 60 km long ( E - W ) , and 10 km wide ( N - S ) , and centered Fig . 4 .
In this case the porphyry Mo and hydrothermal Pb - Zn systems in the northern Gangdese could have formed in the late stages of subduction and early collision .
It comprises the Narigongma , Yulong , Mangzong , Malasongduo deposits in the north which are dated at 35 . 4 - 36 . 6 Ma ( Du et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) , the Machangqing porphyry and Beiyaskarn Au - Cu - Pb - Zn deposit in the central part have Re - Os ages of 33 - 36 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; He et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the Harbo , Chang ' anchong , Tongchang porphyry Cu - Mo , and O Qyo Ho porphyry Mo deposits in the south have ages of 35 - 34 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) .
It comprises the Narigongma , Yulong , Mangzong , Malasongduo , Zhalaga and Duoxiasongduo deposits in the north which are dated at 35 . 4 - 36 . 6 Ma ( Du et al . , 1994 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) , the Machangqing porphyry and Beiyaskarn Au - Cu - Pb - Zn deposit in the central part have Re - Os ages of 33 - 36 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; He et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the Harbo deposits in the south have ages of 35 - 34 Ma ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) .
The most important porphyry Cu - Au - Mo and Au - Cu porphyry as well as epithermal Au systems ( Fig . 2 Precise age data indicate that the ages of the porphyry Cu mineralization in the CAOB shift from east to west and from north to south from Ordovician to Late Carboniferous ( Fig . 2 ) , following the magmatic fronts of the accretionary orogen ( Sengor et al . , 1993 ) .
The two age groups of porphyry systems occurred within two short extensional periods of the post - collisional regimes and their metals and related granitic rocks , were possibly derived from the re - melting residual oceanic slab with some input of crustal materials , whenever the magma rose to shallow levels ( Qu et al . , 2004 ( Qu et al . , , 2007Zheng et al . , 2013Zheng et al . , , 2014 .
Distributions of major porphyry copper and porphyry molybdenum deposits in the eastern and southeast margins of the Tibet Plateau ( modified after Xu et al . ( 2012 ) , Hou and Cook ( 2009 ) , Xu et al . ( 2013Xu et al . ( , 2014 , Peng et al . ( 2013Peng et al . ( , 2014 and Zheng et al . ( 2013Zheng et al . ( , 2014 and based on the tectonic map of Yin and Harrison ( 2000 ) ) .
In addition to the general tectonic , geologic and metallogenic setting , and the distribution of the mineralized systems listed above , descriptions of individual deposits provide important insights into their metallogenic significance ( Seltmann and Porter , 2005 ; Seltmann et al . , 2013Seltmann et al . , , 2014Xiao et al . , 2008 ; Li , 2006 ; Pirajno et al . , 2009 ; Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .
In particular , the key role of postsubduction - related porphyry ore systems is emphasized , comprising collisional and post - collisional Cu - Mo porphyry deposits during the geological history of the Eurasian continent .
The only difference is that the magma formed in the post - subduction setting contains more crustal components .
They are genetically associated with S - type granites and are probably derived from an upper crustal source .
From northeastern to southwestern China , this metallogenic province is bounded by the Daxing ' an , Taihang , and Xuefeng mountains in the west ( Fig . 3 ) .
It is widely accepted that the initial time of the India - Eurasia continental collision is between 65 and 50 Ma ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Ding et al . , 2005 ; Searle et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) , with the main collision occurring between 55 and 50 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) .
The study carried out by Qu et al . ( 2007 ) indicates that the porphyry intrusions responsible for the Cu - Mo deposits in the Gangdese belt are K - enriched and belong to the shoshonitic to high - K calc - alkaline series , characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements ( LILE ) Rb , K , U , Th , Sr , Pb and depletion of high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Nb , Ta , Ti and heavy rare earth elements ( HREE ) and Y without Eu anomalies .

Some of the main features of the spatial - temporal distribution of Cu and Mo porphyry systems and related geodynamic processes of the three metallogenic belts are described .
Peng et al . ( 2013Peng et al . ( , 2014 suggest that during the subduction of the Garze - Litang oceanic slab , partial melting subducted slab or of the mantle wedge above the slab caused the formation of abundant Triassic porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits in the Zhongdian arc .
So far , exploration is concentrated on the Duobuza , Bolong , Nadun , Dibaonamugang , Rongna , Narou and Tiegelong porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Mao et al . ( 2003bMao et al . ( , 2005Mao et al . ( , 2011aMao et al . ( , 2013 , Sun et al . ( 2010 ) and Ouyang et al . ( 2013 ) have provided comprehensive reviews on the metallogeny polymetallic deposits in East China .
Lithocaps are temporally and genetically related to intrusions that may be associated with deeper porphyry - style mineralization ( Sillitoe , 1995a ( Sillitoe , , 1999 ( Sillitoe , , 2011Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Silicic zones at Lep - anto , vuggy or massive in texture , largely occur in proximal lo - cations close to the feeder structure ( s ) and tend to be absent in distal locations , similar to other lithocap horizons ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
Combining the results of alter - ation mineralogy , illite crystallinity , and geochemical anom - alies may improve the targeting of such a vein prospect , despite the anomalies being weak .
Radiometric data reflect bedrock units , but show no effects of mineralization .
Low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap , particularly at the end of an elongate , structurally controlled lithocap , deserve special attention , as the anomaly may be caused by demagnetization due to porphyry - style alteration , e . g . , either phyllic or advanced argillic overprint of potassic alteration .
The geo - logic units include ( 1 ) a basement composed of Late Cretaceous to middle Miocene metavolcanic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks ; ( 2 ) the Miocene 12 to 13 Ma tonalitic Bagon intrusive complex ; ( 3 ) the Pliocene , ~ 2 . 2 to 1 . 8 Ma , Imbanguila dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks ; and ( 4 ) postmineralization cover rocks , including the ~ 1 . 2 to 1 . 0 Ma Bato dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks and the ~ 0 . 02 Ma Lapangan tuff .
The Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal deposit and associated lithocap host is located above and adjacent Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Fig . 1 ) .
All lithocaps have structural roots , or feeders , along which the acidic condensate ascends .
The Guinaoang porphyry deposit and the Lepanto high sul - fidation deposit have no apparent geophysical expression .
As the ionic radius of Au + ( 1 . 37 ) is similar to K + ( 1 . 33 ) , it is argued that Au would have substituted in alunite if Au had been present at the time of alunite formation .
Normalizing whole - rock Pb to the ( Na + K ) molal content produces a proxy for the alunite mineral composition , and this ratio provides the same indications as the LA - ICP - MS analyses of alunite .
This lack of Au in the early , near - surface ( i . e . , low - pressure ) vapors explains the < 50 ppb Au anomaly in whole rock within the Lepanto lithocap .
There are also silicic - advanced argillic alteration patches ~ 600 m above the Far Southeast orebody at the present surface ; these are interpreted to be perched alteration .
The ores of these deposits are largely blind , and this study was conducted in order to identify signatures and directional indicators that would have potential application during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal mineralization nearby .
In sum - mary , the geometry of the unconformity and the spatial distribution of the rock units may have caused the asymmetry of the lithocap .
The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .
If there are multiple permeable layers or perched water tables , it is possible that multiple , stacked horizons of lithocap will form .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation hypersaline liquid and vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
For example , the patches of advanced argillic alteration at the surface directly above Far Southeast are barren ; like - wise , the upper lithocap horizon over the Quimsacocha de - posit , Ecuador , is also largely barren ( IAMGold staff , pers .
Surface signatures of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins At the present erosional surface above the Victoria inter - mediate sulfidation veins , there are subtle alteration ( illite to interstratified illite / smectite to smectite + pyrite ) and geo - chemical ( As , Se ) expressions .
Despite the relative ease of finding lithocaps , it may be difficult to further define the location of mineralization within , under , or adjacent to a large lithocap due to the lack of directional indicators .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .
If the as - cending , structurally controlled acidic fluid encounters a per - meable horizon , either an unconformity or one or more rock units , the reactive fluid will flow along and cause intense leaching and alteration in that layer , creating a lithocap above and lateral from the causative intrusion ( Sillitoe , 1995a ; Hedenquist and Taran , in prep . ) .
LITHOCAPS are horizontal to subhorizontal blankets of residual quartz and advanced argillic alteration of hypogene origin , occurring over intrusions ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
Vectors found in this study include the following : ( 1 ) the alunite peak position at ~ 1480 nm on SWIR spectrum shifts toward higher wavelength in samples that are closer to the intrusive source of acidic condensates ; ( 2 ) in alunite the Pb content decreases closer to the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , La / Pb , and Sr / Pb increase ; ( 3 ) the whole - rock compo - sition of alunite - containing , non - mineralized ( < 0 . 1 % Cu and < 100 ppb Au ) lithocap samples can also point to the intrusive source : Hg , Pb , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center .
A prospect should not be discarded only based on a low level of gold anomaly in quartz - alunite alteration , particularly if the lithocap is large .
This study examined the surface expressions of the three principal deposits Far Southeast ( drilled out ) , and Victoria ( now being mined ) .
This genetic link was demonstrated in the Mankayan district through field observation , radiometric dat - ing , fluid inclusion studies , and stable isotope studies ( Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Selecting non - mineralized samples re - stricts the samples to all having formed in the early leaching and alteration stage , relatively free of overprinting by later mineralizing fluids which may complicate trends .
At the kilometer scale , there is no systematic mineralogical or textural zonation relative to the intrusive source in the Lep - anto lithocap .
The directional indicators and mineralization signatures found in this study have the potential to indicate direction to the intrusive center during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
Oxidation state of sub - arc mantle xenoliths and orogenic peridotites
Partial melting in the mantle wedge and the calc - alkaline trend
Copper , Au , and PGE also have different partition coefficients between various sulfide phases ( liquids and minerals ) and silicate melt .
Lower crustal MASH processes
disseminations of sulfides in cumulate and plutonic rocks , and might not indicate significant depletion of Cu in the residual magmas that reach the upper crust .
Large amounts sulfide ( and contained metals ) might be lost if the lower crust is reduced ( e . g . , graphitic ) , but lesser amounts are expected during interaction with normal crustal rocks .
Reduction by this process is argued to cause reduction of soluble sulfate to less soluble sulfide , leading to saturation of the magma in sulfide melt and / or minerals , and consequent depletion of the magma in metals .
Cr - and Ti - rich spinels have lower Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios than magnetite ( due to substitution of Ti 4 + and Cr 3 + for Fe 3 + ; Waychunas , 1991 ; Stamper et al . , 2014b ) , and their crystallization would therefore tend to cause an increase of the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratio in moderately oxidized primitive to intermediate composition magmas ( i . e . , oxidation ) rather than a decrease .
Typical andesitic arc magmas contain ~ 4 wt . % upon ascent into the upper crust ( Plank et al . , 2013 ) , and can be expected to saturate in H 2 O as pressure falls to 1 - 2 kb , or upon rising to depths of ~ 3 - 6 km ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
Copper and Mo precipitate from these fluids in response to : ( 1 ) cooling between ~ 425° - 350 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Hemley et al . , 1992 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2014b ) ; ( 2 ) the increase in fH 2 S resulting from SO 2 disproportionation ( Simon and Ripley , 2011 ) ; and ( 3 ) in the case of Mo , decreasing pH ( Rempel et al . , 2008 ( Rempel et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB and island arc suites show higher mean and median Cu contents than mature arcs .
For mature arc suites , the overriding trend of the data seems to be towards decreasing Cu contents with differentiation ( decreasing MgO content ) , and the scatter to higher values appears more random .
In combination oxygen fugacity , the sulfur fugacity of magmatic systems plays a critical role in the behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals .
But sulfide saturation is also a function of the overall sulfur content of the system .
These magmas are also characteristically depleted Ti , Ta , and Nb due to their low mobility in slab fluids and / or retention in restite phases ( Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Foley et al . , 2000 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
These sulfides would then be susceptible to oxidation and / or redissolution by exsolving aqueous fluids , and transfer of the contained metals to the fluid ( Spooner , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Larocque et al . , 2000 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010Nadeau et al . , , 2013Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
As for Fe , in a relatively oxidized melt in which most of the S is dissolved as S VI O 4 2 - ( i . e . , where the average valence of S in the melt is > + 4 ; FMQ ≥ ~ + 1 ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Beermann et al . , 2011 ) , fO 2 will increase with S IV O 2 degassing : MS VI O 4 ( melt ) = MO ( melt ) + S IV O 2 ( vapor ) + 0 . 5 O 2 ( melt ) [ eq .
Although minor amounts of Cu can be incorporated into igneous oxides phases , partition coefficients are typically less than 1 indicating that Cu behaves incompatibly with respect to these minerals ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Core et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) ; consequently , their fractional crystallization will not significantly affect the concentration of metals in the melt phase .
The role of sulfur on metal solubility during partial melting
Progressive mantle wedge oxidation may also be reflected in arc metallogeny .
other hand , segregation of sulfide melts and minerals will strongly partition chalcophile elements , and if large volumes of sulfide are fractionated they will strongly deplete the magma in these metals ( potentially forming orthomagmatic sulfide deposits within mafic cumulate rocks ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 6 ) .
In summary , deep crustal MASH processes affecting arc magmas result in variable degrees Cu loss to cumulate sulfides , the amount depending on the oxidation state of the local lower crust .
Although some metals may be carried into the mantle wedge by the subduction zone fluids , this is not essential , because the mantle already contains substantial background concentrations of base and precious metals .
occurs between dissolved sulfide and sulfate dominance in silicate melts at FMQ ≈ + 1 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Nilsson and Peach , 1993 ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , with high concentrations S ( dissolved as SO 4 2 - ) possible in more oxidized magmas ( e . g . , up to 1 . 5 wt . % S ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Beermann et al . , 2011 ) .
Only after the arc crust has thickened and differentiated to lower density compositions will significant volumes magma crystallize as plutonic rocks , with the potential for subsurface volatile release and hydrothermal ore formation .
Although these metals chalcophile and siderophile in character , Au and the PGE are considered to be highly siderophile , and partition strongly into most sulfide phases relative to silicate melts ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ) , while the PGE also partition differentially into metal alloy phases ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
Consequently , magmas reaching the upper crust can be expected to undergo significant oxidation due to SO 2 loss , which on average appears to outweigh the reductive effect of magnetite crystallization .
Consequently , chalcophile and siderophile elements will behave incompatibly ( where residual sulfides are absent ) or weakly compatibly ( where sulfide abundances are low ) , and will tend to partition into the silicate melt , whose sulfur load will be dominantly in the form of sulfate .
Moreover , these anomalously Cu - rich magmas ( if these compositions indeed reflect magmatic values ) do not clearly correlate with known porphyry Cu deposits .
This suggests that magmatic Cu concentrations are moderated by the presence of minor amounts of sulfides in the source , into which chalcophile metals ( such as Cu , Au , and the platinum group elements ; PGE ) will preferentially partition ( Keays , 1987 ( Keays , , 1995Lee et al . , 2012 ) , even for moderately to strongly oxidized rocks .
Assuming that these high - Cu values do reflect magmatic compositions , the reason for this incompatible behavior is not clear , but could be due either to low total sulfur fugacity ( unlikely in most arc settings ) or unusually high oxidation states , such that sulfide solubility was not exceeded or sulfides were destabilized by oxidation ( e . g . , Ballhaus et al . , 1991 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
This narrow peak of Cu concentrations would not be expected to significantly enhance the net flux of Cu from the mantle source region because Cu contents of primitive magmas are uniformly moderate .
As discussed above , reduction will result in voluminous sulfide saturation and loss of potential to form later magmatic hydrothermal ore deposits ; this may explain the dearth of porphyry deposits in , for example , Japan , where the lower crust contains graphitic lithologies ( Sato , 2012 ; Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) .
This is also where the calc - alkaline ( low - Fe ) geochemical character is imprinted on arc magmatic suites , caused by early crystallization Fe - rich minerals ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Romick et al . , 1992 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Pichavant and Macdonald , 2007 ; Hamada and Fujii , 2008 ; Stamper et al . , 2014b ) .
The reliability of these trace element ratios as proxies for magmatic oxidation states is thus unclear at the present time .
Transferring the remaining metal load of the magma into a hydrothermal fluid phase that can generate porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au mineralization might be either a one - or two - step process ,
In the former case , numerous post - subduction scenarios , such as collision or post - collisional rifting , can be envisaged that would re - melt sulfide - bearing lower crustal
It also does not correlate with Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios in the rocks , and both relatively oxidized and relatively reduced rocks can have high Cu contents , although this is not common in either case .
This , suggests that either the magnetite effect is not significant , or that other processes are countering it ( e . g . , Fe 2 + - rich silicate mineral fractionation ) , or both .
The resulting primary magmas are hydrous , tholeiitic basalts ( Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) , which evolve to calc - alkaline compositions by early fractionation of olivine , clinopyroxene , and magnetite , and later crystallization of hornblende and plagioclase ( Grove and Kinzler , 1986 ; Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ) .
In somewhat more evolved rocks ( 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ) , the data scatter to higher Cu contents in both arc and ridge settings , but the bulk of the data remains below ~ 150 ppm Cu .
However , this modest increase in oxidation state is sufficient to shift the balance between dissolved sulfide and sulfate components in the melt towards more soluble sulfates , allowing the magmas to dissolve much larger amounts of sulfur than reduced magmas .
A major proportion of the world ' s Cu , Mo , and Au is mined from hydrothermal ore deposits ( typically porphyry and epithermal deposits ) associated either directly or indirectly with subduction - related magmas .
When plotted against FeO Total , the arc rocks predominantly plot in the - moderately oxidized‖ to - strongly oxidized‖ fields of Blevin ( 2004 ) , whereas the tholeiites are centered on the - moderately reduced‖ field ( Fig . 3 ) .
These hydrous compositions predispose arc magmas to developing - adakite - like‖ trace element signatures of Sr enrichment and heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) depletion , through early and abundant crystallization of pyroxene and hornblende ( which preferentially partition middle ( MREE ) and HREE ) , and late crystallization of plagioclase ( which would otherwise deplete the melt in Sr ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ;
Sparsity of data for elements such as Au and PGE means that it is not clear whether these metals behave in the same way ( see discussion below ) .
These trends appear to be independent of oxidation state , and there is no clear correlation between rocks with higher Cu concentrations and porphyry ore deposits .
The most profound effects likely occur in deep crustal MASH zones ( or - hot zones‖ ; Annen et al . , 2006 ) , which transform and homogenize the flux of basaltic arc magma from the asthenosphere into evolved , intermediate - composition magmas ( basaltic andesites to andesites , and locally more felsic melts derived by crustal melting ; Romick et al . , 1992 ; Eichelberger et al . , 2006 ; Mišković and Francis , 2006 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Lee and Bachmann , 2014 ) .
Instead , the relatively high and increasing oxidation state of evolved arc magmas reaching the upper crust ( FMQ = + 1 to + 2 ) suggests that the bulk of S in these magmas is present as sulfate ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) , with sparse sulfides being stable only because of high total sulfur fugacity ( and therefore also high fH 2 S ) .
On the other hand , it is also clear that most arc magmas ( whether relatively oxidized or reduced ) retain ~ 50 ppm Cu average into the andesitic range of compositions , which is also the value used by Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) to show that normal arc magmas are capable of generating large porphyry Cu deposits .
In particular , the presence of small amounts of Pt - Fe alloy as restite in the mantle source region may have a profound effect on PGE abundances and ratios in partial melts ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
While the presence of sparse sulfide inclusions in phenocrysts in plutonic rocks associated with porphyry deposits is not uncommon ( op .
Evidence from other redox - sensitive elements such as vanadium have yielded conflicting results .
Under mantle conditions , it would seem likely that some sulfide liquid is present , and that it will have a major control on the abundances and ratios of chalcophile elements in arc magmas , particularly if these sulfides are preferentially left in the restite rather than being entrained in the magma , due to their density and wetting properties ( as suggested by Mungall and Su , 2005 ) .
In general , partition coefficients seem to be highest for sulfide liquids ( Li and Audétat , 2012 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , followed by intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) for Cu and Au ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) , monosulfide solid solution ( MSS ; Li and Audétat , 2012 ) , and pyrrhotite ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Zajacz et al . , 2013 ) .
Salinity of the exsolved fluid increases at late stages of crystallization ( ≥90 % ) , but by this point most of the metal content of the magma has been locked up at background concentrations in crystals .
Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) also stress the additional effect of elevated fO 2 in establishing the low - Fe calc - alkaline trend by early crystallization of Fe - rich spinels .
The distribution of data shown in Figures 4 and 5 suggests that Cu contents in mafic magmas from both arc and ridge tectonic settings are similar and generally quite low ( < 200 ppm , similar to values obtained by Lee et al . , 2012 , in mantle melting models ) .
It might be argued that it is these exceptions that give rise to ore deposits , but the effect is not particularly large - rarely more than 2 to 3 times average Cu contents - and thus at most might be expected to affect the size but not the existence of a deposit , and it occurs over a relatively narrow range of intermediate magma compositions ( 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ) .
However , petrogenetic and geochemical considerations suggest that slab melting only occurs in exceptional circumstances in Phanerozoic arcs , such as the subduction of young , hot oceanic lithosphere , or at slab windows or tears where hot asthenosphere directly contacts subducted oceanic crust ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock et , 1994 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
As discussed by Richards ( 2009 ) , the presence of moderate amounts of residual sulfide relative to a large volume of silicate melt ( e . g . , ~ 0 . 001 - 1 wt . % sulfide ; intermediate Rfactor of 10 2 - 10 5 ; Fig . 6 ) will deplete the magma in low - abundance , high partition coefficient elements such as Au and PGE ( highly siderophile elements ) but may have little effect on the concentration of more abundant elements with lower partition coefficient such as Cu , leading to high Cu / Au , Cu / PGE magmas ( e . g . , Park et al . , 2013 ; Fig . 6 ) .
With cooling below ~ 450 °C , the SO 2 - H 2 S buffer curve crosses the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 7 ) , as reflected in the commonly observed late - stage oxidation of early hydrothermal magnetite ( associated with chalcopyrite in potassic alteration ) to hematite + pyrite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sun et al . , 2013 ) .
Consequently , the chemical behavior of these elements in the presence of sulfides and alloys can be expected to be substantially different , and this may explain the widely variable Cu / PGE ratios in resultant ore deposits .
The time required for this transition can be expected to vary depending on the subduction rate , angle of subduction , and other factors , but likely takes on the order of 10 m . y .
involving either direct partitioning of metals from the melt into the exsolving hydrothermal fluid , or preconcentration of metals in an immiscible or crystallizing sulfide phase , followed by redissolution of these sulfides by hydrothermal fluid .
The distribution of the bulk of the data suggests that , under most conditions , the mantle sources of arc magmas are sulfide - saturated ( Keays , 1995 ) , and that most of these magmas remain saturated or close to saturation throughout their differentiation history .
The purpose of this review has been to explore the roles of one intensive parameter ( oxidation state ) and one extensive parameter ( sulfur content ) in arc magma - genesis and metallogeny .
In contrast , Zajacz et al . ( 2012 ) and Sun et al . ( 2014 ) have respectively shown that Cu and Mo solubilities increase steadily with increasing fO 2 , because these metals are dissolved predominantly as oxide species ( CuO 0 . 5 and MoO 3 ) rather than as sulfides .
Unfortunately , because of the difficulty and expense of obtaining accurate trace - level analyses of Au and PGE in igneous rocks , there is very little information on their abundance in arc rocks ( certainly compared to the wealth of data for Cu ) .
This reaction , for the first time in the evolution of typical arc magmatic to hydrothermal systems , generates high activities of dissolved sulfide , which cause the early precipitation of Cuand Mo - bearing sulfide minerals ( chalcopyrite , bornite , and molybdenite , along with pyrite ) .
5 ] ( where M is an element such as Ca or Fe ; Baker and Rutherford , 1996 ) , whereas fO 2 will decrease in a more reduced melt ( i . e . , where the average valence of S in the melt is < + 4 ; FMQ ≤ ~ + 1 ) : An additional late - stage oxidative process that has been proposed by Bell and Simon ( 2011 ) is the exsolution of saline fluids , in which Fe 2 + is more soluble than Fe 3 + , again having the effect of increasing the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratio in the residual magma .
Botcharnikov et al . ( 2011Botcharnikov et al . ( , 2013 have shown that , up to FMQ ≈ + 1 , gold solubility increases in S - bearing basalts - andesites , but drops off sharply at higher oxygen fugacities as sulfide , with which Au combines to dissolve in the melt , breaks down to sulfate .
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 21 occur in some cases , the broad arrays of data shown in Figure 4 are more consistent with mildly compatible behavior of Cu throughout the differentiation range for the bulk of magmas , with incompatible behavior ( as indicated by higher Cu contents ) being the exception .
This process is sometimes referred to as - first boiling‖ ( due to decompression upon ascent ) , whereas - second boiling‖ is caused by post - emplacement crystallization and concentration of water in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989 ) .
With the possible exception of some dikes associated with the Bingham porphyry , Utah ( which contain up to 0 . 1 modal % sulfide globules ; Keith et al . , 1997 ) , such high sulfide concentrations have not been observed in porphyry - related intrusive rocks .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is a key factor that controls the formation of porphyry Cu deposits .
Oceanic crusts older than 25 Ma are not easy to be melted during plate subduction .
Hydrothermal activities are the two major processes that enrich ore - forming elements .
The zircon oxygen fugacities from several porphyry Cu deposits worldwide are estimated and compared with Dexing ( Fig , 5 ) .
The Cu concentration of accumulated fractional melts is based on the partition coefficients , especially the sulfur solubility in the melt , which is mainly controlled by oxygen fugacity ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ; Wood , 2013 , 2015 ) .
The partial melting lower crust and slab melts to get the highest Cu concentration in melts increase from 3 % , through 6 % to 15 % .
The Cu concentrations in fluids is controlled by that of the magma source .
5 The Dexing ore cluster consists of Dexing porphyry Cu deposits , Yinshan epithermal Pb - Zn deposit and , probably also the Jinshan hydrothermal Au deposit .
During partial melting , sulfur under saturation in the melt ( Jugo et al . , 2005b ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) induces sulfide consumption ( see Supplementary Material ) .
Because copper strongly partitions into sulfides , the influence of sulfide ( the sulfur assumed as the form of FeS in the melt for the calculating simplification ) is considered for the Cu estimation following the accumulated fractional melting method .
To form a porphyry Cu deposit ( with an average grade of 0 . 4 - 1 wt % ) , the volume of a source magmas with a Cu content of 75 ppm must be ~ 60 to ~ 150 times larger than the orebody , assuming 90 % of the Cu and Au went into ore - forming fluids and enriched in the ore body .
The special geochemical signature of porphyry magma ( like high La / Yb raitos ) makes it essential to reiterate melts ' compositions and behavior of sulfides at these fO 2 conditions .
Instead , the high fO 2 ( ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) of these magmas is a primary feature of the latest magmatism .
Moreover , the lower continental crust is much drier ( H 2 O content is mostly lower than 1000 ppm ( Xia et al . , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 2008a ; Yang et al . , 2008b ) ) , such that is not a favorable source for the formation of porphyry magmas that could then evolve to produce porphyry Cu deposit .
On the contrary , reduced magmas may become sulfide saturated during evolution in deep magma chambers ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Li , 2014 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) , leading to Cu depletion before emplacement of these magmas at higher levels in the crust .
More importantly , partial melting of metasomatised mantle wedge cannot form the high Sr / Y , La / Yb signature of porphyry Cu deposits .
The common feature of magmas from the three origins is that the Cu content of the aggregated melt increases to a maximum , then decreases , with the partial melting degree .
The higher the initial sulfur concentration of the system , the greater partial melting degree as well as oxidizing conditions is needed for consuming all the sulfur in the residual assemblages .
It has been argued that high oxygen fugacity of the porphyry source may also be inherited from previous subduction modified materials ( Wang et al . , 2014a ) , e . g .
To trace the origin of the high oxygen fugacity in porphyry Cu deposits , we determined trace element compositions and U - Pb ages of magmatic and inherited zircon from Dexing porphyry Cu deposit , calculated Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + of zircons and estimated the oxygen fugacity of their parental magmas .
In this scenario , 5 - 30 % partial melting of subducted slab under an oxygen fugacity higher than FMQ + 1 . 5 produces melts with high Sr / Y and La / Yb , features that are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Under high oxygen fugacity , sulfate is the stable phase ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , which allows release of Cu into the melt during melting , and allows chalcophile metals to be extracted into silicate fluids ( Kiseeva and Wood , 2013 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ) .
Therefore , the efficiency of Cu enrichment through hydrothermal activities is much lower than a shallow arc magma system , and thus the volume of source magmas needed should be further doubled .
One major debate is whether the high oxygen fugacity of the magma was inherited from Neoproterozoic convergent margin magmas ( Hou et al . , 2013 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) or formed during the porphyry magmatism in the Jurassic ( Zhang et al . , 2013b ) .
It is even reported that the most primitive magmatic fluid of the porphyry Cu deposit contains ~ 10 wt % Cu ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) .
Then , from 830 Ma to 745 Ma , the Yangtze blocks amalgamated , followed by rifting ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ) .
This is also related to whether the adakitic characteristics ( high Sr / Y ratio ) of Dexing porphyry magma was derived from partial melting of subducted oceanic crust or thickened lower continental crust .
On the contrary , the same degree of lower crust partial melting leads to a much higher La / Yb ratios ( Fig .
As discussed above , about 40 % to 90 % partial melting of typical lower crust tends to form magmas with very low Cu ( < 75 ppm , Fig . 7 ) .
To form the Sr / Y and La / Yb signature of a porphyry system through melting of the lower continental crust , more than 40 % partial melting is needed .
At over 20 - 30 % partial melting degree of the mantle wedge as suggested for most arc rocks ( Mallik et al . , 2016 ; Mann and Schmidt , 2015 ; Mitchell and Grove , 2015 ) , the Cu concentration of the melt is less than 150 ppm .
Combined with the Sr / Y and La / Yb estimation from slab and lower crust partial melts , 5 - 30 % partial melting degree to produce the adakitic signature is consistent with the Cu enrichment in slab melting model .
This raises the question of how to testify when and how a mineralized porphyry magma becomes oxidized , which is essential to decipher the key factors that controls Cu enrichment .
The Ce N / Ce N * , Ce / Nd ratios , and inferred Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + and fO 2 of inherited Neoproterozoic zircons show a systematically reduced environment compared to that of the Jurassic magmatic zircons that crystallized directly from the Dexing porphyry magma ( Fig . 3 and 5 ) .
Adakitic melts tend to be generated close to the hot plate margins , whereas A - type granites and porphyry Cu - Au deposits form in the center of the opening slab window .
Many adakitic and granitic rocks have been described in the slab window of West Junggar , and we know there are relevant hydrothermal vent Cu - Au deposits in West Junngar , but so far no symmetrical zonation of the deposits has been defined , which would help to confirm and constrain the slab window .
The key magmatic products are adakites that include plutonic and volcanic rocks with intermediate - to high - SiO2 , high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , elevated MgO , Na2O , K2O , Ni hornblende / biotite - bearing high - Mg diorites , and granodiorites to hornblende / pyroxene and Cr contents , and high LILE and LREE elements .

These occurrences are all located in Paleozoic rocks of the southern CAOB , so there is still much scope for discoveries in the northern part .
When pelagic sediments underlain by basalts from a mid - oceanic ridge ( Ocean Plate Stratigraphy ) are accreted , they will be subducted to variable depths from the greenschist to the granulite and eclogite facies .
All these processes will enable the full contribution of ridge subduction and slab window formation to be better understood in the CAOB .
The dikes provide the best evidence so far for the orientation and opening of a slab window in the CAOB , and for the relative movement directions of the downgoing plates during the subduction and closure of swarms of late Carboniferous high - Mg hornblende - biotite diorite dykes with sanukitoid the Paleo - Asian Ocean .
They are typically associated with a wide variety of coeval and compositionally diverse volcanic rocks such as high - Ca boninites , tholeiitic , high - T basalts , alkaline basalts , charnockites , peraluminous TTGs , I - type granites , and mid - ocean ridge ( MOR ) ( not supra - subduction ) ophiolites .
Prominent in one of two slab windows defined in West Junggar are two chemistry that intruded through the slab window .
Nevertheless , many papers were written in early years ( and some even recently ) about inter - related , and often coeval , magmatic rocks in the CAOB like high - Mg adakites , andesites and diorites ; shoshonites and boninites ; Nb - enriched basalts and high - K granites ; porphyry - CuAu mineralization , mixed metasomatized crust - mantle parentage , and associated HT / UHT metamorphism , which are all similar to those associated with modern ridge subduction .
2 - Mineral prospectivity models are affected by applied methods for geochemical anomaly modeling .
Recognizing geochemical anomalies and modeling their spatial associations with particular 9 geological features are critical aspects for mineral exploration and understanding ore geometry ( Ziaii et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) .
In this regard , multi - element associations of Zn - Pb , As - Sb , and Au - Ag - Cu - Mo have been used as indicators for prospecting porphyry - Cu deposits in different areas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Weixuan et al . , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ; Yousefi et al . , 2012 ) , but in the study area the Zn - Pb associations have not shown positive spatial association with the deposit - type sought , and so , they are not significant geochemical signatures for the deposit .
Then , to recognize significant geochemical signatures of the deposit - type sought and evaluate the anomaly mapping methods , we adapted prediction - area ( P - A ) plot , normalized density , and success rate curve .
This shows that these two groups of elements ( Au - Ag - Cu - Mo and Pb - Zn ) have different dispersion patterns ( Figs . 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) .
In the study area of this paper , geochemical signatures of GMPI Pb - Zn ( Figs . 4 , 7 ) and GMPI As - Sb ( Figs . 5 , 8 ) show distal halos from the outcropping mineralized zones .
There are various factors that affect dispersion patterns of geochemical elements in different areas ( Spadoni , 2006 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Yousefi et al . , 2013 ) .
In this regard , based on the results of this paper sample catchment basin modeling of geochemical anomalies result in more reliable target areas for further exploration in comparison with contour maps .
On the other hand , factor analysis may reveals some factors in the chemical composition of stream sediment data that are not genetically related to the deposit - type sought ( Yilmaz , 2003 ; Spadoni , 2006 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Zuo et al . , 2009 ; Xie et al . , 2010 ; Yousefi et al . , 2012 ) .
This is due to the smoothing effect of ordinary moving average contour mapping methods ( e . g . , IDW ) that adversely affects the modeling of geochemical anomalies of stream sediment data ( Zuo , 2011b ) by neglecting locally high values .
