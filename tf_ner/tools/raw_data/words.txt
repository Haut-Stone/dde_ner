Miocene PCDs are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc , and the giant Miocene PCDs cluster in its eastern segment where no Jurassic PCDs occur .
Miocene ore - forming porphyries have young Hf model ages and Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions overlapping with those of the Jurassic rocks in the eastern segment , whereas contemporaneous barren porphyries outside the Jurassic arc have abundant zircon inheritance and crustlike Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions .
Most porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) form in magmatic arcs worldwide and are associated with hydrous ( > 4 wt % H 2 O ) calc - alkaline magmas , derived from an asthenospheric mantle wedge metasomatized by slab fluids ( Richards , 2003 ) .
Most porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) form in magmatic arcs worldwide and are associated with hydrous calc - alkaline magmas , derived from an asthenospheric mantle wedge metasomatized by slab fluids ( Richards , 2003 ) .
Subduction processes are thought to ultimately cause enrichment of metals ( Cu , Au ) and S ( Griffin et al . , 2013 ) and the relatively high oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and high H 2 O contents in arc magmas ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) that are critical to the formation of PCDs .
Northward subduction of the Neo - Tethyan Ocean beneath the Lhasa terrane formed the Jurassic - Cretaceous volcanoplutonic arcs ( Fig . 1B ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .
Porphyry - type mineralization in the Lhasa terrane is linked to two distinct magmatic suites .
The giant Xiongcun PCD ( 219 . 8 Mt Cu resources averaging 0 . 43 % Cu and 0 . 61 g / t Au ; Tafti et al . , 2009 ) with Re - Os molybedenite age of 173 ± 5 Ma ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) is associated with a Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry in the WSJA ( Fig . 1B ) .
The giant Jiama deposit is only 2 km from the nearest outcrop of Jurassic volcanic succes - sions ( Fig . 1B ) .
The Jurassic arc rocks are mainly calc - alkaline , and are characterized by enrichment in large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE ; e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSE ; e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) with flat heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) , thus showing typical subduction - related geochemical features ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1993 ) .
Arc rocks from the WSJA have ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i varying from 0 . 7041 to 0 . 7048 , e Nd ( t ) from + 5 . 5 to + 7 . 5 , and zircon e Hf ( t ) between + 11 and + 18 ( Fig . 2 ) .
The Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are mainly high - K calc - alkaline to shoshonitic ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) with enrichment in LILE ( e . g . , Rb , Ba , Sr ) and depletion in HFSE ( e . g . , Nb , Ta , P , Ti ) , similar to the Jurassic rocks ( Fig . DR1 ) .
The Miocene barren porphyries outside the Jurassic arc have crust - like Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic signatures and abundant zircon inheritance , consistent with a source dominated by old continental crust ( Fig . 2 ) .
The zircon Hf data of the mineralized Miocene porphyries also lie within the evolution trend of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2B ) .
The average zircon e Hf ( t ) values of the Jurassic rocks decrease significantly from the WSJA ( average + 16 ) to the ESJA ( average + 6 ) , suggesting distinct intra - crustal magmatic processes along the arc .
High f O 2 of the arc magma in the WSJA , evidenced by appearance of magmatic anhydrite in the Xiongcun host porphyry ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) , suppressed the formation of significant amounts of Cu - rich sulfides ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) , which led to Cu enrichment in the evolving magma , thus forming the Jurassic PCDs ( Fig . 3 ) .
Hf isotopes might , therefore , be an important tool for assessing the metallogenic fertility of porphyry magmas ( Fig . DR3 ) .
The Jurassic PCDs occur only in the western segment of the Jurassic arc , which has depleted mantle - like isotopic compositions [ e . g . , ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) i = 0 . 7041 - 0 . 7048 ; e Nd ( t ) as high as 7 . 5 , and e Hf ( t ) as high as 18 ] .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment between subduction - and collision - related magmas may be used to evaluate the mineral potential for such deposits in other orogenic belts .
The India - Asia continental collision zone was built on a complex tectonic collage of terranes accreted onto the southern margin of the Asian continent since the Mesozoic ( Fig . 1A ; Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .
The India - Asia collision during the Cenozoic produced a 1500 - km - long trans - Himalayan Miocene igneous belt along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Miller et al . , 1999 ) , and led to crustal thickening ( as much as 80 km ) in south Lhasa ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) .

The Miocene post - collisional magmas occur as isolated stocks of porphyritic monzogranite and minor granodiorite and granite .
The mineralized porphyries developed in the Jurassic arc , whereas contemporaneous barren ones were emplaced outside the arc ( Fig . 1B ) .
The Miocene PCDs show a close spatial relationship with the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , despite being separated by a time interval of ~ 170 - 130 m . y .
This Jurassic arc is divided by a north - south - oriented rift into a western segment ( WSJA ) and an eastern segment ( ESJA ) , which are dominated by diorite intrusions with andesites , and granitic intrusions with basalt and dacite , respectively .
Their zircon Hf isotopic as doi : 10 . 1130 / G36362 . 1 Geology , published online on 5 February 2015 compositions plot within the inferred evolution trend of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA on plot of e Hf ( t ) versus age ( Fig . 2B ) .
They have Sr - Nd isotopic compositions partly overlapping with those of the Jurassic rocks and plot along a two - component mixing array between Jurassic basalt and old lower crust in Tibet ( Fig . 2A ) .
However , the ESJA barren rocks show Sr - Nd isotopic departure from the depleted mantle toward the crust ( Fig . 2 ) , indicating the involvement of old crustal components ( < 15 vol % ) , consistent with old Hf model ages for these rocks ( ca .
Pronounced crustal thickening at 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) and subsequent slab break - off ( or tearing ) starting at 25 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) triggered this remelting as isotherms rebounded and / or hot asthenospheric melts infiltrated the lithosphere ( Richards , 2009 ) .
The trend to lower e Nd ( t ) shown by some ore - related porphyries could reflect mixing with lesser amounts ( 5 % - 30 % ) of old lower crust ( Fig . 2A ) .

The lack of Miocene PCDs outside of the Jurassic arc suggests that there are no sulfidebearing Jurassic cumulates to remelt there .
For example , the giant Qulong deposit ( 1420 Mt at 0 . 5 % Cu and 0 . 03 % Mo ; is partly hosted by Jurassic dacitic lavas .
Importantly , the coeval Miocene porphyry intrusions emplaced outside of the Jurassic arc are all barren ( Fig . 1B ) .
The genesis of continental collision - related porphyry Cu deposits ( PCDs ) remains controversial .
These are the Jurassic arc suites associated with Cu - Au deposits ( e . g . , Xiongcun , Laze , and Zemoduola ; Tafti et al . , 2009 ) , and the Miocene post - collisional suites associated with Cu - Mo deposits ( e . g . , Qulong , Jiama , Tinggong , and Chongjiang ; Hou et al . , 2009 ) .
However , the Sr - Nd - Hf isotopic compositions of rocks from the western and eastern segments are distinct .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions with those of the Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Importantly , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are spatially confined to the Jurassic arc ( Fig . 1B ) , and have overlapping Sr - Nd isotopic compositions Jurassic rocks from the ESJA ( Fig . 2A ) .
Recently , such PCDs have been found in collisional zones such as that in Tibet , where they are associated with post - collisional magmas emplaced as isolated complexes within the Jurassic - Cretaceous magmatic arcs ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .
We suggest that systematic zircon e Hf measurement could be effective in identifying the most prospective areas during regional targeting of PCDs .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au and Miocene collision - related Cu - Mo porphyry deposits in south Tibet .
Here , we studied Jurassic subduction - related Cu - Au porphyry deposits in south Tibet .

In contrast , the barren Miocene porphyries have higher ( 87 Sr / 86 Sr ) t = 15Ma ( 0 . 7063 - 0 . 7101 ) and lower e Nd ( t = 15Ma ) ( - 8 . 1 to - 3 . 1 ) and zircon e Hf ( t ) ( - 8 to + 5 ; Fig . 2 ) .
Compared with the Jurassic rocks , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries have higher light REE and LILE contents , and lower HREE and HFSE contents with steeper HREE patterns ( Fig . DR1 ) .
By contrast , the Miocene Cu - Mo - related porphyries are free of inherited zircons , and have relatively " depleted " isotopic compositions and younger Hf model ages ( average 800 Ma ) , suggesting a juvenile source ( Hou et al . , 2004 ( Hou et al . , , 2013a .

In addition , the Miocene Cu - Morelated porphyries have higher Sr / Y ratios ( 23 - 186 ) and higher ( La / Yb ) N ratios ( 11 - 47 ) than the Jurassic rocks , showing geochemical affinity with adakite ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) .

All porphyries have zircon U - Pb ages of 26 - 13 Ma with a peak at 16 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2013a ) , and the associated PCDs have molybdenite Re - Os ages of 17 - 14 Ma ( Hou et al . , 2009 ) , postdating subduction - related Jurassic PCDs by at least 150 m . y .
These results imply that incorporation of crustal components during underplating of Jurassic magma induced copper accumulation as sulfides at the base of the eastern Jurassic arc , inhibiting PCD formation at this time .
Typical examples include : the Miocene post - collisional Kerman porphyry Cu belt , occurring within a non - economic Eocene magmatic arc in Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) ; the Cretaceous giant PCDs , developed along the Mesozoic Qinling orogen in central China ( Dong et al . , 2011 ) ; and the Jurassic giant Dexing PCD , formed on a Mesozoic intra - continental orogen in east China ( Hou et al . , 2013b ) .
In contrast , localization of Miocene PCDs within the Jurassic arc implies that metal - rich Jurassic cumulates could release Cu into the Miocene porphyry systems ( Lee et al . . , 2012 ) .
Our new evidence suggests that remelting of sulfide - bearing , lower crustal cumulates of former arc magmas associated with subductionrelated PCDs could produce giant collisionrelated PCDs .
The Lhasa terrane , bounded by the Meso - Tethyan Bangong - Nujiang suture and the Neo - Tethyan Indus - Yarlung Zangbo suture ( Fig . 1A ) , is composed of Precambrian crystalline basement and Paleozoic - Mesozoic shallow marine clastic strata .
This suggests that the arc segment barren for subduction - related PCDs could be fertile for collision - related PCDs .
These magmas are thought to derive by remelting of a thickened juvenile mafic lower crust ( Hou et al . , 2004 ) resulting from previous arc magmatism ( Richards , 2009 ; Hou et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ) with subduction - associated PCDs ( Tafti et al . , 2009 ) .
Other PCDs are ~ 20 - 50 km away from Jurassic magmatic rocks ( Fig . 1B ) .
These data suggest that remelting of the lower crustal sulfide - bearing Cu - rich Jurassic cumulates , triggered by Cenozoic crustal thickening and / or subsequent slab break - off , led to the formation of giant Miocene PCDs .
The complementary metal endowment of the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic suites ( Fig . 1 ) suggests that enrichment of Cu in the juvenile mafic lower crust , though inhibiting the Jurassic PCD formation , could have provided abundant metals for the Miocene giant PCDs by breakdown of the host sulfides during post - collisional melting .
The remelting scenario is also supported by the subduction - like features of the Miocene ore - related porphyries ( such as Nb - Ta negative anomaly ) , which were inherited from the Jurassic arc magmas ( Richards , 2009 ) .

Geochemical and isotope data suggest that the WSJA arc rocks associated with the subduction - related PCDs derive from subductionmodified asthenospheric mantle ( Fig . 2 ; Fig . DR1 ; Chu et al . , 2006 ) .

Numerous 184 - 158 Ma granitoids and associated Jurassic volcanic rocks form a 600 - kmlong Jurassic arc ( JA ) ( Geng et al . , 2005 ) , onto which a > 1000 - km - long Cretaceous arc was subsequently superimposed ( Fig . 1 ) .
By contrast , incorporation of older crust by the ESJA basaltic rock , indicated by the lower and variable zircon e Hf ( t ) ( + 1 to + 12 ) , may be responsible for lowering magmatic f O 2 ( e . g . , Ripley and Li , 2013 ) , thus inducing sulfide saturation ( Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) and sequestering Cu - rich sulfides ( Nadeau et al . , 2010 ) in the Jurassic lower - crustal arc cumulates ( Fig . 3 ) .

This model implies a spatial relationship between subduction - and collision - related PCDs , but it is unclear whether a genetic linkage exists .
This is applicable to other orogenic belts , where former arc magmatism left sulfide - bearing metalrich cumulates at the base of the crust ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2012 ) , which provided abundant metals and S for post - subduction or collision - related PCDs during later remelting ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .
The most common hypothesis links their genesis with magmas derived from subduction - modified arc lithosphere .
Thirty - two key samples from the PCDs and relevant magmatic rocks in south Tibet were analyzed for major and trace element chemistry and bulk - rock Sr - Nd and zircon Hf isotopic compositions ( Tables DR1 - DR3 in the GSA Data Repository 1 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons from the Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
This is supported by the east - west spatial variation in the average e Hf ( t ) values of magmatic zircons Jurassic and Miocene magmatic rocks ( Fig . DR3 ) .
These observations are consistent with derivation of these ore - related Miocene porphyries by remelting of the juvenile mafic rocks underplated during the Jurassic magmatism .
Our study highlights a spatial overlap and genetic linkage between giant collision - related PCDs and non - economic volcano - plutonic arcs .
Here , we report new geological , geochemical , and isotopic data for Jurassic subductionand Miocene collision - related PCDs in southern Tibet .
This suggests that remelting of the Jurassic cumulates took place in a thickened crust ( > 50 - 55 km ) within the amphibole and garnet stability field ( Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) , consistent with Cenozoic collision - induced crustal thickening in south Tibet ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ) .

Therefore , the spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment between subduction - and collision - related porphyry suites could be used for predicting PCD occurrence and assessing the mineralization potential of other tectonically composite orogens .
Porphyry copper systems supply about 75 % of the world ' s copper 1 .
Copper contents of primary magmas are controlled by the oxidation state of their source , which determines the stability of residual sulphide phases , the main host of Cu ( refs 8 , 11 ) : higher oxidation states in the source result in higher Cu contents of the primary magma 8 .

Arcs developed on crust > 30 km thick have median Cu values decreasing at a low rate between 10 and ∼5 wt % MgO ( ∼3 . 5 parts per million ( ppm ) Cu / wt % MgO ) and at a higher rate ( ∼9 ppm Cu / wt % MgO ) below ∼5 wt % MgO .

Magmatic H 2 O contents and fO 2 play a prominent role in the development of tholeiitic versus calc - alkaline trends [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] 18 : high water contents and fO 2 lead to calc - alkaline trends through suppression of plagioclase fractionation and promotion of early magnetite and amphibole fractionation 4 , 6 .

Copper saturation in magmas is intimately bound to the onset of magnetite crystallization 23 , which induces sulphide saturation and consequent Cu sequestration into either a fluid 24 or , more likely , a sulphide melt 25 , 26 .
Arc magmas evolving in thinner crust are systematically enriched in Cu at intermediate MgO contents because of retarded magnetite crystallization , which also produces a tholeiitic trend therein ( Fig . 1c , d ) .

A ∼4 - 6 - Myr - long magmatic evolution in a thick crust arc could thus separate ∼30 - 50 Mt of sulphide - bound Cu km −1 arc , that is , typical amounts of Cu contained in supergiant porphyry - type copper deposits 2 .
The ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc carried by magmas in thin arcs correspond to the theoretic average global Cu flux through arcs ( Supplementary Table 5 ) , suggesting that in thin arcs Cu is quantitatively carried by magmas .
Such magmas result from continuous iron depletion during differentiation , in contrast to tholeiitic magmas that show initial iron enrichment during differentiation 3 .
Such magmas result from continuous iron depletion during differentiation , in contrast to tholeiitic magmas that show initial iron enrichment during differentiation 3 .
Such copper accumulations are an essential step in forming porphyry systems [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] .
In these arcs also Fe 2 O 3tot decreases at a lower rate ( ∼0 . 2 wt % Fe 2 O 3tot / wt % MgO ) between 10 and 5 wt % MgO and at a higher rate ( 1 . 3 wt % Fe 2 O 3tot / wt . % MgO ) below ∼5 wt % MgO .
A simple fractional crystallization model using MELTS , a software package for modelling phase equilibria in magmatic systems ( refs 21 , 22 ) , reproduces the observed Fe 2 O 3tot - MgO trends by varying H 2 O contents ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ) .
Trends of Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot versus MgO contents of bulk rocks differ depending on arc thickness ( Fig . 1 ) .

I find that magmas of thicker arcs are systematically more calc - alkaline and more depleted in copper than magmas of thinner arcs .

11 ) median Cu contents in arcs developed on crust < 20 km thick steadily increase at arc - dependent rates to maximum values of ∼200 ppm at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO ( Fig . 1c ) .
Although the magmatic rocks treated here are not associated with mineralization , the previous discussion may explain why specific large - scale environmental factors ( that is , thick crust ) and magmatic features ( that is , calc - alkaline rather than tholeiitic magmas ) represent a favourable general framework for the formation of porphyry copper systems 27 .
Also in these arcs the Cu versus MgO trend is mimicked by Fe 2 O 3tot : median Fe 2 O 3tot first increases at arcdependent rates from ∼10 wt % at 10 wt % MgO to a maximum median value of ∼14 wt % at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO , then sharply decreases to ∼1 wt % at ∼0 wt % MgO .
As far as the water content effect on the calc - alkaline trend is concerned , this correlation is better accounted for by the fact that magmatic evolution occurs on average at deeper crustal levels in thick arcs compared with thin arcs 17 , 19 .

As a result , water contents of magmas evolving at higher depth increase rapidly to high values 20 , even at relatively high MgO in the residual melt 17 , because water is incompatible and more soluble at higher pressure .

In contrast , arc magmas evolving in thicker crust start to lose Cu early because of early magnetite crystallization , which also produces a calc - alkaline trend therein ( Fig . 1a , b ) .

They form above subduction zones and are preferentially associated with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
It follows that averages of median Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot contents of magmas at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO for the 23 arcs display significant linear negative correlations with arc crustal thicknesses ( r = 0 . 76 , p < 0 . 0001 for Cu and r = 0 . 71 , p < 0 . 0003 for Fe 2 O 3tot , excluding the anomalously thick Central Andes : Fig . 2a , b ) .

As the onset of magnetite crystallization is controlled by crustal thickness ( Fig . 2b ) , median Cu contents of arc magmas at MgO ∼4 - 6 wt % also correlate significantly with crustal thickness for the Quaternary arcs ( Fig . 2a ) .

The differential Cu evolution in thin ( tholeiitic ) and thick ( calc - alkaline ) arcs implies that magmatic products in thin arcs carry on average ∼12 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc , whereas those in thick arcs carry on average only 4 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc ( Supplementary Table 4 and Fig . 2 ) .

It has been suggested that sequestration of Cu by magmatic sulphides in the lower crust or at the crust - mantle boundary during a protracted period could play a critical role in the formation of porphyry copper systems by creating Cu pre - concentrations in specific arc segments that may be prone to mobilization by later magmas [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] .
This implies that the missing copper in the former accumulates as copper sulphides within or at the base of thicker arcs .
The authors inferred that the Cu lost by evolving arc magmas is sequestered by sulphide phases in the lower crust .
The inverse correlation between tholeiitic character ( Fe 2 O 3tot enrichment at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO ) and arc thickness ( Fig . 2b ) suggests that magmas evolving in thicker arcs are richer in H 2 O and more oxidized than those evolving in thinner arcs .

Additionally , it is likely that fO 2 correlates positively with water contents during deep crustal evolution 17 enhancing the effect of crustal thickness on the development of the calc - alkaline trend .
These characteristics , as well as magmatic metal contents , are thought to be imparted in the mantle source by fluids of the subducted slab 8 - 10 .
Despite the commonly held view that arc magmas are more hydrous and oxidized at the mantle source than mid - ocean ridge basalts 9 , 10 ( MORB ) and therefore should also be richer in chalcophile metals ( Cu , Au ; ref .
Here I investigate the behaviour of Cu during magmatic evolution ( MgO from 10 to ∼0 wt % ) in 23 Quaternary ( - Miocene ) arcs ( Supplementary Tables 1 - 2 and Dataset ) with the aim to identify upper plate factors determining magmatic Cu enrichment / depletion .

The global scale correlations among arc crustal thickness , Cu and Fe 2 O 3tot have important implications for the understanding of firstorder factors controlling the development of calc - alkaline versus tholeiitic trends and Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas .

Yet this process does not explain why porphyry copper systems preferentially occur in thicker arcs 1 , 2 .
A previous study 11 has also shown that arc magmas sooner or later undergo Cu depletion during evolution and attributed this to varying oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) conditions during magmatic differentiation .
The results presented here suggest that larger amounts of Cu can be concentrated within or at the base of the crust of thicker arc segments and may provide a consistent explanation to why porphyry copper systems form preferentially ( although not exclusively ) in thick arcs in association with calc - alkaline magmas 1 , 2 .
These results suggest that the thickness of the overriding plate provides a more important control on magma differentiation than the composition of the mantle source , and can explain the preferential association of porphyry copper systems with calc - alkaline magmas and thicker arcs .
The positive correlation between averages of median Fe 2 O 3tot and Cu contents at ∼4 - 6 wt % MgO for the 23 arcs ( Fig . 2c ) supports an Earth - scale role for magnetite controlling Cu saturation in arc magmas .

The above arguments suggest that the processes of Cu enrichment / depletion in arc magmas , which may ultimately play an important role in the Cu deficit of the continental crust and in the formation of porphyry copper deposits 11 , are controlled by the upper plate .

Starting from initial values between 50 and 100 ppm at 10 wt % MgO ( similar to Cu in thicker arcs and in MORB ; ref .
Owing to its large - scale approach , implying comparisons among entire arc segments , this investigation is necessarily about first - order factors controlling the behaviour of copper in arc magmas .
In contrast , following the same reasoning , there is a deficit of ∼8 Mt Cu Myr −1 km −1 arc in magmas of thick arcs , which implies loss of magmatic Cu and its sequestration within the thick crust as copper sulphides .

Nonetheless , as shown by the heterogeneous spatial and temporal distribution of porphyry - type deposits also within thick arcs 12 , only a special combination of regional to local scale conditions 28 will ultimately allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems within the generally favourable environment of thick arcs .

Here I present a statistical assessment of more than 40 , 000 published geochemical analyses of magmatic rocks from 23 Quaternary - aged volcanic arcs worldwide .
To reduce the bias induced by outliers and to extract information on general trends , data of each arc were statistically treated by calculating median values of Cu , Fe 2 O 3tot and MgO for subpopulations corresponding to intervals ∼0 . 5 wt % MgO ( Supplementary Table 2 ) .
This correlation cannot be explained by source effects alone : in such cases the strong control of upper plate thickness on the development of the tholeiitic / calc - alkaline trends would not be expected .

The NE China microcontinental Block was affected by the Mongol - Okhotsk suture ( Fig . 1 ) to the north and the Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) to the south in Permo - Triassic ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Mongol - Okhotsk suture stretches along the southeastern boundary of the Siberian Craton over 3000 km , extending from the present - day Udsky gulf of the Okhotsk Sea to the Khangay mountain range in Central Mongolia ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) .

The closure of Mianlue ocean started first in the Dabie region and migrated westward ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . 2006 ) from the Early Permian and to Middle - Late Triassic , causing the formation of Mianlue suture ( [ 26 ] ) .

Jurassic to Cretaceous subduction system
The Jurassic to Cenozoic subduction systems are developed both along southwestern and eastern margins of China .
Southward oceanic subduction of the Bangong - Nujiang Ocean from the Permian to the Early Cretaceous gave rise to extensive calc - alkaline magmatism on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Zhang et al . , 2012b ) .

The diorite porphyries and feldspar porphyries are ore - forming porphyry in the Mengxi Cu - Mo deposit .

These data are consistent with a transitional island arc from immature arc to mature arc and suggest that the ore - bearing porphyry system was derived from the partial melting of multiple sources including oceanic crust and a subduction - modified mantle wedge ( Shen et al . , 2009 ) .

Positive εNd values ( + 4 to + 10 ) and marked negative Nb anomalies for both intrusive and extrusive rocks can be explained by the mixing of magma derived from depleted mantle with 6 - 18 % of a partial melt derived from the lower part of a juvenile arc crust with a composition similar to coeval A - type granites in the region , plus minor contamination with the upper continental crust .

The zircon εHf ( t ) values and whole - rock Sr / Y ratios concentrated at 100 - 10 of the Dexing metallogenic granites suggests that the magma was derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile crust , formed through thickened lithospheric mantle delamination at ~ 160 Ma in an intracontinental setting Wang et al . , 2015b ) .

The superimposed orogenesis , including the superimposing between different episodes of accretionary orogeny , collisional orogeny , mantle plume , and demantling can be summarized into the following categories : ( 1 ) continental collision superimposed on the pre - Cenozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab in the Emeishan large igneous province as described in section 2 . 4 ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .
and Pacific plate subduction ( e . g . , Sun et al . , 2007 ) , and mainly developed on the Paleoproterozoic suture ( Li et al . , 2012a ; Deng and Wang , 2015 ) .
The superimposed orogeny is best exemplified by the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ) orogenic belts , which comprise blocks separated from Gondwana through the opening of Paleo - , Meso - , and Neo - Tethyan oceans ( Fig . 5 ) .

The subduction of the main Paleo - Tethyan oceanic crust and those of its branches generated arc magmatism as well as S - type granitoids ( Figs . stage , after the lithosphere has been thickened , the lithospheric mantle was removed leading to the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism in the northern margin of Tibet and Sanjiang belts during 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2005 ; ) .

The superimposed orogeny in Tibet and Sanjiang is characterized by the spatial overlap between the accretionary orogenesis during the evolution of Tethyan oceans and the Indian - Eurasian continental collision ( Figs . 12 and 14 ) .
The shearing disaggregated the ophiolite forming mélange zone , and the magmatism developed along the Tethyan or even earlier subduction zones developed with subduction - related igneous rocks .
The lithosphere shortening and rotation , as well as lower lithospheric mantle removal , which was considered to have triggered the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism ( Deng et al . , 2014b ) , has largely reshaped the lithospheric structure .

The metallogenic types in these two types of orogenesis are also different .
The subduction rate is smaller , andesites are generally dominant , and the lithosphere thickens , with a greater contribution to the growth of the continental lithosphere ( Doglioni et al . , 2007 ) .
The ancient sutures between blocks , craton margins , and arcs acted as favorable locations for the production of ore deposit during the later tectonic events ( Fig . 18 ) .
The sutures in North China Craton include the Inner Mongolia suture , Trans - North China Orogen and Jiao - Liao - Ji Belt , as well as those between the smaller Archean blocks ( Fig . 7 ) .
The remelting of Neoproterozoic juvenile crust resulted in the metal - carrying magma , ( Fig . 19d ) and the metamorphism of juvenile crust during continental lithospheric subduction of Yangtze Craton and concomitant crustal shearing was deduced to release gold - rich metamorphic fluid ( Fig . 19c ) . Another important fact for the spatial preferences is the lithosphere structure vulnerable to tectonic reactivation and relatively high crust permeability .

The reactivation of ancient sutures , craton margins and arcs was evidently controlled by lithospheric mantle removal , eclogite delamination , and resultant ancient and juvenile crustal melting ( e . g . , Deng et al . , 2016a ) .

The systems are closely related to underlying composite plutons , at paleodepths of 5 to 15 km , which represent the supply chambers for the magmas and fluids that formed the vertically elongate ( > 3 km ) stocks or dike swarms and associated mineralization .
Individual systems have life spans of ~ 100 , 000 to several mil - lion years , whereas deposit clusters or alignments as well as entire belts may remain active for 10 m . y .

PORPHYRY Cu systems are defined as large volumes ( 10− > 100 km 3 ) of hydrothermally altered rock centered on porphyry Cu stocks that may also contain skarn , carbonate - replacement , sediment - hosted , and high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal base and precious metal mineralization .

The deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems may contain porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits of various sizes ( < 10 million metric tons [ Mt ] - 10 billion metric tons [ Gt ] ) as well as Cu , Au , and / or Zn skarns ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) , whereas their shallower parts may host high - and intermediate - sulfidation epithermal Au ± Ag ± Cu orebodies ( < 1 Mt− > 1 Gt ) .
Porphyry Cu systems were generated worldwide since the Archean , although Meso - Cenozoic examples are most abundantly preserved ( e . g . , Singer et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) , probably because younger arc terranes are normally the least eroded ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Kesler and Wilkinson , 2006 ; Wilkinson and Kesler , 2009 ) .

The systems also contain major resources of these metals as well as including the world ' s largest known exploitable concentrations of Cu ( 203 Mt : Los Bronces - Río Blanco , central Chile ; A . J .
Typical hypogene porphyry Cu deposits have average grades of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent Cu , < 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 percent Mo , and 0 . 0× to 1 . 5 g / t Au , although a few " Auonly " deposits have Au tenors of 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 g / t but little Cu ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Porphyry Cu systems show a marked tendency to occur in linear , typically orogen - parallel belts , which range from a few tens to hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long , as exemplified by the Andes of western South America ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Fig . 2 ) and the Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt of Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria ( Janković , 1977 ; Popov et al . , 2002 ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu belts developed during well - defined metallogenic epochs , which isotopic dating shows to have typical durations of 10 to 20 m . y .
Individual porphyry Cu belts are commonly spatially separate rather than superimposed on one another , reflecting arc migration as a result of steepening or shallowing of subducted slabs between the individual magmatic - metallogenic epochs ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems are generated mainly in magmatic arc ( including backarc ) environments subjected to a spectrum of regional - scale stress regimes , apparently ranging from moderately extensional through oblique slip to contractional ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Strongly extensional settings , typified by compositionally bimodal basalt - rhyolite magmatism , lack significant porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1999a ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Large high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
Faults and fault intersections are invariably involved , to greater or lesser degrees , in determining the formational sites and geometries of porphyry Cu systems and their constituent parts .
Intra - arc fault systems , active before as well as during magmatism and porphyry Cu generation , are particularly important localizers , as exemplified by the Domeyko fault system during development of the preeminent middle Eocene to early Oligocene belt of northern Chile ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 , and references therein ; Fig . 2 ) .
Arc - parallel alignments may occur along intra - arc fault zones , as exemplified by the Chuquicamata district , northern Chile ( Fig . 3b ) whereas cross - arc fault zones or lineaments control arc - transverse alignments , as in the Cadia , New South Wales ( Fig . 3c ) and Oyu Tolgoi , Mongolia districts ( Fig . 3d ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Outcropping precursor plutons normally represent the shallower , earlier consolidated parts rather than the magma volumes from which the fluids for porphyry Cu generation were derived ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline or , less commonly , alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .

Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Massive carbonate sequences , particularly where marble is developed near intrusive contacts , and other poorly fractured , fine - grained rocks have the capacity to act as relatively Serrano et al . , 1996 ; J . C . Toro , writ .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may be similarly blind , beneath a thick limestone sequence in the case of Pueblo Viejo .
Ferrous Fe - rich lithologic units also appear to favor highgrade porphyry Cu mineralization ( e . g . , Ray and Mineral Park , Arizona ; Phillips et al . , 1974 ; Wilkinson et al . , 1982 ) , presumably because of their capacity to effectively precipitate Cu transported in oxidized magmatic fluids ( see below ) .
Mineralization elsewhere in porphyry Cu systems may be even more profoundly influenced by rock type .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .

Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Wall - rock xenoliths in the marginal parts of some porphyry intrusions may be sufficiently abundant to constitute intrusion breccias .
Mo - rich porphyry Cu deposits are normally tied to the more felsic intrusions , whereas Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits tend to be related to the more mafic end members , although intrusions as felsic as quartz monzonite may also host Au - rich examples ( e . g . , Mamut , East Malaysia ; Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ) .
Diatreme breccias have a distinctive texture , in which widely separated , typically centimeter - sized clasts are dominated by rock - flour matrix containing an andesitic to dacitic tuffaceous component ( Table 1 ) , the latter commonly difficult to recognize where alteration is intense .

Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
The late - mineral porphyry lacks veinlets and displays only propylitic alteration .
The breccia clasts may be set in rock - flour matrix , hydrothermal cement , fine - grained igneous material , or some combination of the three .
Igneous matrices tend to be more common at depth near the magmatic source , where the term igneous breccia is appropriately applied ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , generally occupying steep , pipelike to irregular bodies , are commonly intermineral in timing as a result of being generated in close association with intermineral porphyry phases ( Figs . 6 , 8 ) .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Sericitized breccia may change downward to potassic - altered breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Phreatic breccias , as exemplified by pebble dikes , normally contain polymictic clast populations set in muddy , rock - flour matrices ( Table 1 ) .
The tops of the orebodies tend to be relatively abrupt and controlled by the apices of quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The shape of any porphyry Cu orebody may undergo significant modification as a result of emplacement of late - to postmineral rock volumes ( e . g . , Fig . 5a ) , as exemplified by the low - grade cores caused by internal emplacement of latemineral porphyry phases ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Philippines ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) and , much less commonly , latestage diatremes ( e . g . , El Teniente ; Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Camus , 2003 ) .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Alteration - mineralization zoning in porphyry Cu deposits
Porphyry Cu deposits display a consistent , broad - scale alteration - mineralization zoning pattern that comprises , centrally from the bottom upward , several of sodic - calcic , potassic , chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and advanced argillic ( cf .
Chloritic and propylitic alteration develop distally at shallow and deeper levels , respectively ( Fig . 10 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Sericitic alteration may project vertically downward as an annulus separating the potassic and propylitic zones as well as cutting the potassic zone centrally as shown .
Sericitic alteration tends to be more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits , whereas chlorite - sericite alteration develops preferentially in porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration - mineralization in the lithocap is commonly far more complex than shown , particularly where structural control is paramount .

Sodic - calcic alteration , commonly magnetite bearing ( Table 2 ) , is normally rather poorly preserved at depth in some porphyry Cu deposits , commonly in the immediate wall rocks to the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Panguna , Papua New Guinea and El Teniente ; Ford , 1978 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , a position that may give rise to confusion with propylitic alteration ( Fig . 10 ) .

Sodic - calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Nugget Hill , Philippines ) , in some of which hybrid potassic - calcic ( biotite - actinolite - magnetite ) assemblages are also commonplace ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Ridgeway , and Cotabambas , southern Peru ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Wilson et al . , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004a ) .
Biotite is the predominant alteration mineral in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , whereas K - feldspar increases in abundance in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings .
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Pyrrhotite may accompany the pyrite where reduced host rocks are present ( e . g . , Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 2003b ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration ( Table 2 ) , giving rise to distinctive , pale - green rocks , is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , particularly Au - rich examples , where it overprints preexisting potassic assemblages ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10−12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety that is greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .
Distal Au skarns are typically more reduced ( pyroxene rich ) than their proximal counterparts ( Fortitude , Copper Canyon district ; Myers and Meinert , 1991 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits display single veinlet sequences that comply with the generalizations summarized above and ( Barr et al . , 1976 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2002 .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .

PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS in Figure 13 and Table 2 , but repetitions of group 1 and 2 veinlets , for example , early biotite , EDM halo , and A types cut by lesser numbers of later EDM halo and A types ( e . g . , Bingham ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ) , occur where time gaps between porphyry phases are sufficiently large ; however , group 2 and 3 veinlets are only uncommonly repeated .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .

Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Absence of anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .

Tourmaline may occur in minor amounts in several veinlet types , even those formed early in deposit histories ( e . g . , T4 veinlets al Los Pelambres ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) , but it is most abundant with quartz and / or pyrite in D - type veinlet generations and any associated magmatic - hydrothermal breccias affected by sericitic alteration ( Fig . 8 ) .
Advanced argillic lithocaps
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , which may either wholly or partially overlie and conceal porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) or occur alongside them and , hence , above propylitic rock ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina , Argentina , Batu Hijau , and Rosia Poieni , Romania ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ; Clode et al . , 1999 ; Milu et al . , 2004 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components of many ledges .

Metal zoning in porphyry Cu systems is well documented , particularly at the deeper , porphyry Cu levels ( e . g . , Jerome , 1966 ; Titley , 1993 ) .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
Peripheral veins cutting propylitic halos may also be Au rich , and at Mineral Park an outward zoning from Pb - Zn to Au - Ag is evident ( Eidel et al . , 1968 ; Lang and Eastoe , 1988 ; Fig . 9b ) .

The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious and base metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Magma and fluid production
Porphyry Cu systems typically span the upper 4 km or so of the crust ( Singer et al . , 2008 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) , with their centrally located stocks being connected downward to parental magma chambers at depths of perhaps 5 to 15 km ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ; Fig . 4 ) .
The parental chambers , tending to be localized at sites of neutral buoyancy ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) , are the sources of both magmas and hightemperature , high - pressure metalliferous fluids throughout system development .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Convection provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of copious amounts of the aqueous phase , in the form of bubble - rich magma , from throughout the parental chambers to the basal parts of porphyry stocks or dike swarms ( Candela , 1991 ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The shallow - level porphyry stocks do not themselves generate the bulk of the magmatic fluid volume , but simply act as " exhaust valves , " conduits for its upward transmission from the parental chambers , perhaps via cupolas on their roofs ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu mineralization in the deeply formed ( up to 9 km ) potassic alteration zones at Butte and elsewhere took place directly from a single - phase , relatively low salinity ( 2−10 wt % NaCl equiv ) , aqueous liquid ( Rusk et al . , 2004 ( Rusk et al . , , 2008a ; such a phase may contain several thousand ppm to several percent of base metals and several ppm Au , based on thermodynamic ( Heinrich , 2005 ) and analytical ( Audétat et al . , 2008 ) observations .
Fluid inclusion microanalysis and experimental studies reveal that , during phase separation , specific element suites selectively fractionate between the vapor and hypersaline liquid .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S ± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Potassic alteration and associated metal deposition are initiated under near - lithostatic conditions and involve extensive hydraulic fracturing of the ductile rock at high strain rates ( Fournier , 1999 ) to generate the pervasive stockwork veining ( Burnham , 1979 ) : a process that may give rise to large increases in rock volume ( Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The single - phase liquid , the mineralizer in deeply formed porphyry Cu deposits , may generate the relatively uncommon EDM halo veinlets ( Rusk et al . , 2008a ; Proffett , 2009 ) , whereas the two - phase fluid produces the more common A - and B - type quartz veinlets ( e . g . , Roedder , 1984 , and references therein ) .
The stockwork veinlets control and focus continued fluid ascent , with partial dissolution of quartz during cooling through its retrograde solubility field ( < ~ 550 - 400 °C at pressures < ~ 900 b ; Fournier , 1999 ) enhancing the permeability of the A - type quartz veinlets during at least some of the Cu - Fe sulfide precipitation ( Rusk and Reed , 2002 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) ; synmineral faulting and fracturing may play a similar role .
The quartz - veined cores of potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .

Fluid pressures may fluctuate from lithostatic to hydrostatic during porphyry Cu formation ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , as a result of both repetitive fracture propagation and sealing and reductions in confining pressure consequent upon surface degradation ( see below ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal brecciation may be triggered by sudden release of fluid overpressures caused by roof failure above large , expanding vapor bubbles ( Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; Burnham , 1985 ) , particularly near the ductile - brittle transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions have crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .

Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10× dilution of the hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .

High Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .

The Cordilleran massive sulfide lodes are localized where the liquid follows pronounced structural permeability spanning the sericitic to advanced argillic transition ( Figs . 6 , 10 ) or , less commonly , encounters reactive carbonate rocks ( e . g . , Baumgartner et al . , 2008 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Diatreme breccias are preferentially emplaced at this time because external water access to late - mineral magma bodies , a requirement for phreatomagmatic activity , is facilitated .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts where porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms are overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .

Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive , thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .

Porous and permeable volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequences also favor large - tonnage orebody development in the lithocap environment , especially where they happen to be shallowly located with respect to paleosurfaces .

Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
Thermal regimes that permit vertically extensive ore zone development in potassic zones commonly have greater size potential than those that were excessively hot internally , thereby inhibiting sulfide precipitation and giving rise to large , lowgrade or barren cores ; the exception is where the resultant shell - like orebodies are areally extensive and thick ( e . g . , Bingham and Resolution ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .

Structural permeability linking porphyry stocks to the fringes of carbonate rock - dominated districts seems to be a requirement for formation of substantial sediment - hosted Au deposits ( e . g . , Bingham district ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are arguably the most studied and potentially best known and understood ore deposit type ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , and their relationships with the skarn environment have been appreciated for many years ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A positive topographic expression results only where barren , late - to postmineral porphyry plugs intrude the diatreme breccias ( e . g . , Dizon and Guinaoang , Philippines and Batu Hijau ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Fig . 6 ) .
A quartz - pyrite assemblage replaces any carbonate rocks incorporated in advanced argillic lithocaps ( e . g . , Bisbee , Arizona ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
The distinctive aplitic groundmass texture is ascribed to pressure quenching during rapid ascent and consequent volatile loss ( Burnham , 1967 ) .
The pebble dikes and related breccias are chiefly restricted to porphyry Cu deposits , including their marginal parts , whereas brecciation induced by the fluid confinement typifies the overlying highsulfidation epithermal environment ( Fig . 6 ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration has varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .

The upper parts of porphyry Cu systems , mainly at shallower levels than their porphyry intrusions , are characterized by lithocaps : lithologically controlled zones of pervasive advanced argillic alteration with structurally controlled components , including their subvertical root zones ( Figs . 4 , 6 , 10 ; Table 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

The parental magmas need to be water rich ( > ~ 4 wt % ) and oxidized in order to maximize the metal contents of the resultant aqueous phase ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Candela , 1992 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700° to 550 °C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .

As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .

The low - salinity liquid , whose ascent is controlled by the preexisting quartz veinlet stockworks , synmineral faults , and permeability contrasts provided by steep intrusive contacts , appears to be responsible for the progressive formation of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic alteration , as well as continued advanced argillic alteration and the principal Cu and Au mineralization in the overlying lithocaps Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Rusk et al . , 2008b ) .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction to produce liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .

If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps in which quartz - pyrophyllite ± muscovite ± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .

In lithocaps , permeable lithologic units are an especially important control of the largest high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , as mentioned previously , in contrast to tight rocks , such as little - fractured lava domes and flows , which typically host smaller , fault - and fracture - controlled deposits .
The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks , but generally prior to initiation of the systems .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .

The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz - bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration - mineralization .

The Cu and , in places , Au contents of skarns are typically higher still .
Each belt corresponds to a magmatic arc of broadly similar overall dimensions .
The stress regime depends , among other factors , on whether there is trench advance or rollback and the degree of obliquity of the plate convergence vector ( Dewey , 1980 ) .
The precursor plutons may act as hosts to a single deposit , as at Mount Polley , British Columbia ( Fraser et al . , 1995 ) ; an alignment of coalesced deposits , as in the Los Bronces - Río Blanco district ( Fig . 5a ) ; or clusters of two or more discrete deposits , as in the El Abra intrusive complex , northern Chile ( Fig . 5b ) and Guichon Creek batholith , Highland Valley district , British Columbia ( Fig . 5c ) .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The precursor pluton is multiphase , whereas the parental pluton is shown as a single body in which the concentric dotted lines mark its progressive inward consolidation .
The volcanic sequence is a stratovolcano ( but could just as readily be a dome complex ; Fig . 6 ) and has been partly eroded prior to porphyry Cu formation .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts of the underlying rocks .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts underlying rocks .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry Cu - related intrusions comprise multiple phases ( Kirkham , 1971 ; Gustafson , 1978 ) , which were emplaced immediately before ( early porphyries ) , during ( intermineral porphyries ) , near the end of ( late mineral porphyries ) , and after ( postmineral porphyries ) the alteration and mineralization events ( Fig . 6 ) .
The earlier porphyry bodies are not destroyed when intruded by later phases but merely split apart , causing overall inflation of the rock package as would occur during ordinary dike emplacement .
The upper contacts of a few porphyry Cu intrusions are characterized by unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) : alternating , crenulate layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyry produced as a result of pressure fluctuations at the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions ( e . g . , Kirkham and Sinclair , 1988 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; .

The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The porphyry intrusions contain variable amounts of phenocrysts , typically including hornblende and / or biotite , and fine - grained , commonly aplitic groundmass , resulting in open to crowded textures .
The porphyry phases in some individual deposits may have clear compositional differences ( e . g . , Bajo de la Alumbrera ; Proffett , 2003 ) and / or characteristic igneous textures ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) ; however , particularly in many porphyry Au and Cu - Au deposits , the different phases are commonly only subtly different or nearly identical .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix of many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .

Many diatremes are late - stage additions to porphyry Cu systems , in which they commonly postdate and either cut or occur alongside porphyry Cu mineralization at depth ( Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Garwin , 2002 ) but overlap with high - sulfidation events at shallower epithermal levels ( e . g . , Dizon ; Fig . 6 ) .
The diatremes , particularly their contact zones , may localize part of the high - sulfidation Au mineralization ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu , Papua New Guinea ; Fig . 6 ) .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .

The breccias are typically late - stage features and , hence , unaltered and barren .
the magmatic - hydrothermal breccias and pebble dikes at the porphyry Cu level , these phreatic breccias in the high - sulfidation environment may attain the paleosurface , where hydrothermal eruptions result in subaerial breccia accumulation as aprons around the eruptive vents ( e . g . , Hedenquist and Henley , 1985 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The massive , high - sulfidation pyrite - enargite replacements in carbonate rocks are also locally transitional outward through high - to intermediate - sulfidation Zn - Pb - Ag ore , a continuum observed in the Tintic and Colquijirca districts ( Lindgren and Loughlin , 1919 ; Bendezú et al . , 2003 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers of rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .

The chalcopyrite ± bornite ore in many porphyry Cu deposits is largely confined to potassic zones ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) , with one or more bornite - rich centers characterizing the deeper , central parts of many deposits .

The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .

The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .

The Cu - bearing sulfides typically occur as fine - grained coatings on disseminated pyrite grains , which leads to recognition difficulties in deposits that also underwent supergene Cu sulfide enrichment ( e . g . , Chuquicamata , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) ; indeed , the hypogene contribution is commonly not distinguished from the supergene enrichment products ( e . g . , Taca Taca Bajo , Argentina ; Rojas et al . , 1999 ) .

Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .

The veinlet sequence in porphyry Cu deposits , first elaborated by Gustafson and Hunt ( 1975 ) at El Salvador and widely studied since ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ; Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) , is highly distinctive .

The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits where relevant data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .

The quartz veinlets commonly cut proximal prograde exoskarn ( Einaudi , 1982 ) but do not extend into the more distal carbonate rock - hosted ore types .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers of both translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .

The anhydrite , attaining 5 to 15 percent of rock volumes , occurs in small amounts in most group 2 and 3 veinlet types as well as in the form of disseminated grains in the intervening altered rocks but commonly also constitutes end - stage , nearly monomineralic veinlets .

The roots of lithocaps may also contain the relatively high temperature species , andalusite and corundum ( > ~ 370ºC ; Hemley et al . , 1980 ) , as accompaniments to pyrophyllite and / or muscovite ( e . g . , Cabang Kiri , Indonesia , El Salvador , and Cerro Colorado ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .
The principal borosilicate mineral in lithocaps is dumortierite rather than tourmaline .
The overlying vadose zones are marked by easily recognizable , steam - heated alteration rich in fine - grained , powdery cristobalite , alunite , and kaolinite ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

The Au grains in some deposits contain minor amounts of PGE minerals , particularly Pd tellurides ( Tarkian and Stribrny , 1999 ) .

Any intermediate - sulfidation precious metal mineralization developed alongside the lithocaps contains much higher contents of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn than the high - sulfidation orebodies , in keeping with the situation described above from the porphyry Cu level .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .

Any carbonate rocks affected by the lithocap environment may be particularly receptive .
Each porphyry Cu epoch is closely linked to a time - equivalent magmatic event .
Each porphyry Cu epoch is closely linked to a time - equivalent magmatic event .
Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain minor volumes ( 5−10 % ) of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia ( Fig . 6 ) ; however , even major deposits can be either breccia free , as at Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , or breccia dominated , as exemplified by > 5 Gt of ore - grade breccia at Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Warnaars et al . , 1985 ; Serrano et al . , 1996 ; Fig . 5a ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits are formed as vertically extensive bodies , which become progressively lower grade both outward and downward , whereas others have a bell - or cap - like form because little Cu was precipitated internally at depth ( e . g . , Resolution ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
Many lithocaps are vertically zoned , from the previously described quartz - pyrophyllite at depth to predominant quartz - alunite and residual quartz - the residue of extreme base leaching ( Stoffregen , 1987 ) with a vuggy appearance that reflects the original rock texture - at shallower levels where the causative fluid was cooler and , hence , more acidic ( Giggenbach , 1997 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Late porphyry Cu system evolution
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .

These phreatic breccias host ore in many high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu deposits ( e . g . , Choquelimpie , northern Chile ; Gröpper et al . , 1991 ) .
A few deposits , instead of dying out either gradually ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) or fairly abruptly ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq , Pakistan ) at depth , have knife - sharp bases as a result of truncation by latemineral intrusions ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
These high - sulfidation assemblages commonly have higher Cu contents than the former potassic alteration , resulting in hypogene enrichment ( Brimhall , 1979 ) , although any Au may be depleted ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .

These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline or chalcedonic silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ºC ) of silica deposition .

These Zn - Pb - Ag ± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As ± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Early porphyry Cu system evolution
These pressure variations may induce changes in the fluid phases present and consequent remobilization as well as precipitation of metals ( e . g . , Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic assemblages , and sericitic alteration does the same to potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .

In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu ± Au ± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Where lower grade intermineral intrusions and barren lateand postmineral intrusions or diatremes are volumetrically important , the original mineralized rock volumes may be physically disrupted and ore - zone geometries radically changed and generally rendered less continuous .
Hence , pebble dikes display downward transitions to porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Tintic , Utah and Toquepala , southern Peru ; Farmin , 1934 ; Zweng and Clark , 1995 ) , whereas the breccias triggered by fluid confinement do not normally form in close proximity to intrusive bodies .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration is centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

Such a decrease in solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

As the thermal regimes of porphyry Cu systems decay , shallowly generated alteration - mineralization types become telescoped over more deeply formed ones ( e . g . , Gustafson , 1978 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) , thereby causing the sequence of metal remobilization and reprecipitation events emphasized above .

In any deposit cluster or alignment , the best deposit may be found first or only after several lesser discoveries have already been made ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Kirwin et al . , 2003 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .
In some bornite - rich centers , the sulfidation state is low enough to stabilize digenite ± chalcocite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Table 2 ) .

In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo tends to be concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

The only fluid present is of external origin and produces propylitic alteration similar to that in the earlier formed propylitic halos .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .

Vertical clast transport may be appreciable ( e . g . , > 1 km at Tintic ; Morris and Lovering , 1979 ) .
Although rock flour may occur between the clasts , quartz , chalcedony , alunite , barite , pyrite , and enargite are also widely observed as cementing minerals .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
Specific opaque mineral assemblages are intrinsic parts of each alteration type ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) because of the direct linkage between sulfidation state , the chief control on sulfide assemblages , and solution pH , a principal control of alteration type ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ; Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Fig . 12 ) .
Although Cu and / or Au tenors of the former potassic zones may undergo depletion during the chlorite - sericite overprints ( e . g . , Esperanza , northern Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) , metal introduction is also widely recognized ( e . g . , Leach , 1999 ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) and , at a few deposits , is considered to account for much of the contained Cu ( e . g . , Cerro Colorado , northern Chile ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .

The same liquid continues upward into the lithocap where , upon cooling in an unbuffered environment , it evolves into a high sulfidation - state liquid ; if properly focused , it may generate high - sulfidation ( HS ) epithermal deposits .
Abundant hydrothermal magnetite is a good indicator of potentially Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe , 1979 ) , and the presence of banded quartz veinlets may be used to identify most , but not all , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits .
( 7 ) if externally derived , nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?

This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems , including the overlying lithocaps .
Note that subvolcanic basement rocks host much of the porphyry Cu deposit on the left , whereas that on the right is mainly enclosed by two phases of the precursor pluton .

However , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits appear to occur exclusively in association with calcalkaline diorite and quartz diorite porphyries ( e . g . , .
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Note that shallow alteration - mineralization types consistently overprint deeper ones .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K ± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

However , sericitic alteration may also constitute ore where appreciable Cu remains with the pyrite , either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( typically , pyrite - bornite , pyrite - chalcocite , pyrite - covellite , pyritetennantite , and pyrite - enargite ; Table 2 ; cf .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .

overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , effects that are accompanied by downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
However , meteoric water involvement in late sericitic alteration is by no means precluded ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , particularly on the margins of systems where the advecting magmatic liquid may entrain convecting meteoric water , although its formerly preeminent role in the porphyry Cu genetic model ( e . g . , Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Hunt , 1991 ) is now greatly diminished .
However , local structural observations , perhaps interpreted from geophysical responses , may assist in this regard , although this approach played no part in the recent discoveries noted above in the Chilean porphyry Cu districts .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .

However , through - going structural ( fault and fracture network ) and hydrothermal ( phreatic breccia and vuggy , residual quartz ) permeability is probably the most critical requirement for the development of important high - sulfidation deposits ; otherwise , inadequate latestage aqueous liquids from the cooling parental magma chambers gain access to the lithocaps .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal - or Au - bearing veins and mantos .
Along with calc - alkaline batholiths and volcanic chains , they are the hallmarks of magmatic arcs constructed above active subduction zones at convergent plate margins ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ) , although a minority of such systems occupies postcollisional and other tectonic settings that develop after subduction ceases ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .

Changes in crustal stress regime are considered by some as especially favorable times for porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposit generation ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) , with Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera , Argentina , for example , both apparently occupying such a tectonic niche ( Presnell , 1997 ; Sasso and Clark , 1998 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
The entire breccia body originally underwent potassic alteration prior to partial overprinting by sericitic and , subsequently , advanced argillic assemblages , as documented by localized occurrence of remanent magnetite and muscovite after coarse - grained biotite in the cement to the sericitized breccia .

Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .

There , it condenses into ground water to oxidize and produce the low - temperature , acidic fluid responsible for the blanketlike , advanced argillic alteration zones characteristic of the steam - heated environment ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

Commonly , the highest grade and most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .

Elsewhere , small - volume porphyry intrusions and the associated magmatic fluids fail to effectively penetrate low - permeability rock packages , leading to the apparently uncommon development of blind , high - grade deposits , as at Hugo Dummett in the Oyu Tolgoi district ( Kirwin et al . , 2003 and Ridgeway in the Cadia district ( Wilson et al . , 2003 ) .
Diatremes , upward - flared volcanic vents generated mainly by phreatomagmatic eruptive activity , are widespread in porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1985 ) , including their shallow , epithermal parts ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Much of the Mo in many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits occurs in the B - type veinlets , in marked contrast to the Cu dominance of the A - type generations , but D - type veinlets may also contain appreciable amounts of molybdenite in some deposits .
Addition of mafic melt to the parental chambers could be an effective means of augmenting S and metal budgets Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Maughan et al . , 2002 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Progressive disproportionation of the contained SO 2 ( to H 2 SO 4 and H 2 S ) once it and HCl ( plus any HF ) condense into ground water ( Giggenbach , 1992 ; Rye , 1993 ) generates the extremely low pH fluid responsible for the high degrees of base leaching involved in advanced argillic lithocap formation ( e . g . , Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Clusters are broadly equidimensional groupings of deposits ( e . g . , Globe - Miami district , Arizona ; Fig . 3a ) , whereas alignments are linear deposit arrays oriented either parallel or transverse to the magmatic arcs and their coincident porphyry Cu belts .

End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
In arcs where volcanic rocks are abundant , large - volume ignimbrites , indicative of caldera formation , are taken to seriously downgrade porphyry Cu and related epithermal Au potential for the reason given above .

However , the erosion involved in the unroofing of porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .

In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .

However , the patches may also comprise alunite or kaolinite , suggesting that the texture may result by either preferential nucleation of any common advanced argillic mineral or even advanced argillic overprinting of a nucleation texture developed during earlier potassic or chlorite - sericite alteration of fragmental rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 , and Caspiche ) .

However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
In contrast , Cu and Mo correlate less well , with spatial separation of the two metals commonly resulting from the different timing of their introduction ( e . g . , Los Pelambres ; Atkinson et al . , 1996 ) .
In contrast , Mo may be transported as different , possibly oxochloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( Ulrich and Mavrogenes , 2008 ) .
The different Mo complexing ( see above ) , probably assisted by progressive increase of the Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , results in much of the molybdenite being precipitated not only later than but also spatially separate from the bulk of the Cu ± Au ( see above ) .

These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .

The resultant telescoping is potentially more extreme , giving rise to deep penetration of advanced argillic alteration into porphyry stocks , where porphyry Cu systems undergo either rapid , synhydrothermal erosion under high uplift , pluvial or glacial conditions ( Fig . 14 ) or , perhaps less commonly , gravity - induced sector collapse of any overlying volcanic edifices ( Sillitoe , 1994 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Landtwing et al . , 2002 ; Carman , 2003 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ) .

Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .

For example , porphyry Cu prospects containing only weakly developed potassic alteration and A - type quartz veinlets in their central parts , indicating a deficiency of early - stage magmatic fluids , are typically subore grade .
Although many hydrothermal breccias , like the late diatremes mentioned above , are commonly diluents to ore , some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias give rise to anomalously highgrade rock volumes despite their intermineral timing .
Furthermore , magmatic - hydrothermal breccia cemented mainly by quartz , tourmaline , and pyrite may be zoned downward over hundreds of meters to chalcopyrite - rich material , which is likely to persist into any underlying biotite - cemented breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Fig . 8 ) .
( 10 ) why is Au transported to the distal limits of only a few porphyry Cu systems for concentration in sediment - hosted deposits , and why are most of these apparently small compared to virtually identical Carlin - type deposits ( Cline et al . , 2005 ) ?
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .

Commonly , the xenoliths are largely assimilated by the younger phases , leaving only the contained quartz veinlets , chemically more refractory than the host porphyry , as " floating " pieces ( Fig . 7 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .

In contrast to The alteration - mineralization is zoned from advanced argillic ( with pyriteenargite ) at the top through sericitic ( with shallow pyrite and deep chalcopyrite ) to potassic ( with magnetite - chalcopyrite ± bornite ) at the bottom , where the breccia texture may be almost imperceptible and pegmatoidal pods are commonplace .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .

In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous , retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .

Apart from the massive , commonly enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .

Nevertheless , the lithocap mineralization also contains greater albeit trace amounts of Bi , W , Sn , and / or Te ( e . g . , Einaudi , 1982 ) as well as appreciable Mo .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Nevertheless , resorption of any sulfide melt during ascent of oxidized magmatic fluids could make a major contribution to metal budgets ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ) .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched in Na , K , and Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .

The voluminous vapor readily separates from the coexisting hypersaline liquid and , because of its lower density , ascends buoyantly into the 1 - to 2 - km - thick rock column above the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Cooling of the hypersaline liquid in contact with external wall rocks and dilution with meteoric water in the propylitic halos may be the main causes of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn precipitation ( Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) , giving rise to the geochemical halos of these metals and , in some systems , localized vein concentrations ( Jerome , 1966 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
( 2 ) what are cross - arc lineaments , and can they be demonstrated to play a truly influential role in the localization of porphyry Cu systems ?
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps .
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries lithocaps .
The sequence of alteration - mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling , from > 700° to < 250 °C , caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition .
The size of the stocks does not appear to bear any obvious relationship to the size of the associated porphyry Cu deposits and their Cu contents ( cf .
The most common hydrothermal breccias in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems are of magmatic - hydrothermal type , the products of release of overpressured magmatic FIG .
Hence , many of the breccias overprint preexisting alteration - mineralization patterns and veinlet types ( e . g . , Red Mountain , Arizona ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , which are incorporated as clasts .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
On entering the lithocap environment , this intermediate sulfidation - state liquid ( forming chalcopyrite and tennantite at depth ) becomes unbuffered and easily evolves to a higher sulfidation state on cooling ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
Each individual deposit or prospect must be carefully constructed using surface mapping and core logging , with particular attention paid to the temporal as well as spatial relationships of its constituent parts .

The processes of subduction erosion and terrane accretion at convergent margins may assist with land - or trenchward migration of the arcs and contained porphyry Cu belts ( e . g . , von Huene and Scholl , 1991 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Several types of phreatic ( meteoric - hydrothermal ) breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .

The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization types become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 12 ) , with the result that the shallower alteration - mineralization zones invariably overprint and at least partly reconstitute deeper ones .
younger than the potassic zone that it overprints ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Padilla - Garza et al . , 2004 ) , reflecting the time needed for the telescoping to take place .
In some systems , Mn ( ± Ag ) is also markedly enriched in the outermost parts of the halos ( e . g . , Butte ; Meyer et al . , 1968 ) .
The recent major porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au discoveries in the productive Collahuasi ( Rosario Oeste ) , Chuquicamata ( Toki cluster ; Rivera and Pardo , 2004 ; Fig . 3b ) , Escondida ( Pampa Escondida ) , and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Los Sulfatos ; Fig . 5a ) districts of Chile are all within < 1 to 3 km of the previously known deposits , as are the several porphyry Cu - Au discoveries in the Cadia district ( Holliday et al . , 1999 ) and high - sulfidation Au discoveries in the Yanacocha district ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) that were made since mining commenced .

The forms of many porphyry Cu deposits mimic those of their host intrusions ; thus , cylindrical stocks typically host cylindrical orebodies ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas laterally extensive dikes give rise to orebodies with similar narrow , elongate shapes ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
It may constitute annular zones separating the potassic cores from propylitic halos , as emphasized in early porphyry Cu models ( Jerome , 1966 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Rose , 1970 ) , but is perhaps more common as structurally controlled or apparently irregular replacements within the upper parts of chlorite - sericite and / or potassic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .

Once formed , the quartz - bearing veinlets are permanent features that are not erased during subsequent alteration overprinting , although their metal contents may be wholly or partially removed ( see above ) .
As the underlying parental magma chambers progressively solidify and magma convection ceases , there are marked reductions in both the heat flux and aqueous fluid supply to the 26 RICHARD H .

Alternatively , a single - phase liquid may form , possibly after separation of some brine , by subsequent contraction of vapor of the same composition as it cools at elevated pressures above the critical curve of the fluid system ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .

( 5 ) what are the deep processes that result in some porphyry Cu systems being apparently short lived while others may remain at least intermittently active for up to ≥5 m . y . ?

In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .

Emplacement of the porphyry stocks in many central Andean deposits took from 2 to 5 m . y . , implying that appreciable time ( 0 . 5−1 . 5 m . y . )
Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .

Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization at shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .

Proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted mineralization types are obviously dependent on the presence of reactive carbonate rocks , particularly thinly bedded , silty units .
Large parts of many porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Titley , 1982 ) , especially deeply formed ( e . g . , Butte ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008a or relatively deeply eroded examples like El Abra ( Ambrus , 1977 ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) and Gaby ( Gabriela Mistral ) , northern Chile ( Camus , 2001 ( Camus , , 2003 , are made up predominantly of potassic alteration , which grades marginally into generally weakly developed propylitic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The sequence , from potassic with peripheral propylitic ( prop ) through chlorite - sericite and sericitic to advanced argillic , is the result of increasing acidity consequent upon the declining temperature of the hydrothermal fluids .
Note the absence of Cu - bearing sulfides from the early , high - temperature advanced argillic zone .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .
In addition , upward decompression and expansion of the vapor phase causes rapidly decreasing solubility of the vapor - transported metals ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ) , as confirmed by their very low contents in high - temperature but atmospheric - pressure fumaroles ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) .

Much of the metal in many porphyry Cu deposits is contained in the quartz - dominated , group 2 veinlets and as disseminated grains in the intervening potassic - altered rocks , although some of the late , group 3 quartz - sulfide veins and their wall rocks may also be important contributors .
Indeed , two or more porphyry Cu deposits may underlie some large , coalesced lithocaps ( Fig . 4 ) , which , as noted above , may have formed progressively over periods of up to several million years ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .

In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( ± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
Indeed , the tops of porphyry intrusions may be subjected to at least four distinct alteration - mineralization events , commencing with potassic and ending with advanced argillic , as temperature fronts retreat downward ( Fig . 14 ) .
Elsewhere , however , lower temperature quartz - kaolinite is the dominant overprint assemblage ( e . g . , Caspiche , northern Chile ) .
Nevertheless , in some porphyry Cu deposits , these halo metals , particularly Zn , occur as late - stage veinlet arrays overprinting the Cu - dominated cores rather than peripherally ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
The Cu / Au ratios of lithocap - hosted , highsulfidation mineralization tend to decrease upward , with the result that most major high - sulfidation Au ( ± Ag ) deposits occur in the shallow parts of lithocaps , commonly - but not always - with their tops immediately below the former paleowater table positions ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration event ( s ) that affect the early and intermineral porphyries and their immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric but possibly containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .

Exceptionally ferrous Fe - rich rocks , relatively uncommon in most arc terranes , also appear to assist with development of high hypogene Cu grades as well as maximizing the wall rock - hosted component of the deposit ( e . g . , El Teniente , Resolution , Oyu Tolgoi ) .
They commonly occur as tabular veins overprinting porphyry Cu deposits , like those at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) , Escondida ( Ojeda , 1986 ) , Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , and Collahuasi , northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Nevertheless , in many porphyry Cu deposits , it is fluid cooling over the ~ 550º to 350 °C range , assisted by fluid - rock interaction , that is largely responsible for precipitation of the Cu , in low sulfidation - state Cu - Fe sulfide assemblages , plus any Au ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The large size of some porphyry Cu systems , with maximum radii of ~ 8 km ( e . g . , Fig . 9 ) and maximum areal extents approaching 100 km 2 ( Singer et al . , 2008 ) , complicates their effective exploration because attention is unavoidably focused on the more prominently altered parts , such as pyrite - bearing porphyry Cu mineralization , pyrite halos , and pyrite - rich lithocaps .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

At the district scale , porphyry Cu systems and their contained deposits tend to occur as clusters or alignments that may attain 5 to 30 km across or in length , respectively .

The legend explains the temporal sequence of rock types , with the porphyry stock predating maardiatreme emplacement , which in turn overlaps lithocap development and phreatic brecciation .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous or siliciclastic wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .

Locally , however , the intermediate - sulfidation and both Cor dilleran lode and shallow , disseminated high - sulfidation mineralization types display transitional mineralogic relationships , as exemplified by the so - called Main Stage veins at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) and the disseminated A and Link Au zones at Wafi - Golpu ( Leach , 1999 ; Ryan and Vigar , 1999 )
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions in early quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .

The upward - escaping , low - pressure vapor that does not attain the paleosurface as high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Hedenquist , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993 ) forms acidic condensate to produce generally barren advanced argillic alteration .

( 3 ) how important are mafic magmas in the development of the parental magma chambers beneath porphyry Cu systems , and what material contributions do they make to the systems themselves ?
There , distinction from phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias may be difficult because of texture obliteration caused by intense advanced argillic alteration ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ) .

Volumes of the different alteration types vary markedly from deposit to deposit .
In such situations , the advanced argillic alteration may be 1 to > 2 m . y .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Assessment of the likely host - rock lithologic units is also important during initial appraisals of porphyry Cu districts .
Lateral transfer of such liquids beyond lithocaps to form intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits is also dependent on the existence of suitable permeability , which in a few cases is the direct continuation of that utilized by the contiguous high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Colquijirca , Tintic ) .
( 12 ) why do only a few lithocaps appear to develop intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits on their peripheries ?
It may be speculated that crustal compression aids development of large mid - to upper - crustal magma chambers ( Takada , 1994 ) capable of efficient fractionation and magmatic fluid generation and release , especially at times of rapid uplift and erosional unroofing ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) , events which may presage initiation of stress relaxation ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au ± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .

The abovecited examples of mineralogic transitions between high - and intermediate - sulfidation mineralization provide support for this mechanism .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits , typically with above - average Cu tenors .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits above - average Cu tenors .
They are distinguished from the phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias by several features ( Table 1 ) , particularly the absence of tuffaceous material .
At several localities , the advanced argillic alteration at the bottoms of lithocaps displays a characteristic patchy texture , commonly defined by amoeboid pyrophyllite patches embedded in silicified rock ( e . g . , Escondida and Yanacocha ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ) .
Irrespective of whether the Cu - bearing sulfide minerals are coprecipitated with veinlet quartz or , as generally seems to be the case , introduced paragenetically later ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2001Redmond et al . , , 2004 , a particularly strong correlation exists between quartz veinlet intensity and metal content in many porphyry Cu deposits , particularly in Au - rich examples ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
in the case of long - lived porphyry Cu systems , whereas elsewhere the loci of intrusive and hydrothermal activity migrate , either systematically or randomly , to give rise to the porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposit clusters and alignments discussed above .
By the time that the late - mineral porphyry phases are added to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , fluid ascent from the parental magma chambers has all but ceased , and K and metal availability is too limited to generate appreciable potassic alteration and mineralization .
The existence of even minor erosional remnants of steam - heated horizons and their chalcedonic bases , generated above and at paleowater tables , respectively , guarantees that the appropriate near - surface level is preserved ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Simplified sections through high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits to illustrate the wide variation in alteration zoning patterns and their relationship to porphyry intrusions and Cu tenor .
The immediately premineral , early porphyries and their contiguous host rocks contain the highest grade mineralization in most deposits although , exceptionally , the earliest phase can be poorly mineralized ( e . g . , Grasberg ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ) .

However , if the overprinted high - sulfidation assemblages also contain appreciable arsenical sulfosalts , a situation that becomes increasingly likely upward in most systems , the resultant mineralization is less desirable because it is not only refractory if subjected to bacterial heap leaching but also generates As - rich flotation concentrates that may prove difficult to market .

Spatial relationships between porphyry Cu stocks , underlying pluton , overlying comagmatic volcanic rocks , and the lithocap .
The deeper , central cores of porphyry Cu systems are occupied by porphyry Cu deposits , in which ore - zone geometries depend mainly on the overall form of the host stock or dike complex , the depositional sites of the Cu - bearing sulfides , and the positions of any late , low - and subore - grade porphyry intrusions and diatremes .

Coalescence of closely spaced porphyry Cu deposits enhances size potential ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ) Development of wall rock - hosted orebodies alongside porphyry Cu deposits is most common where receptive carbonate rocks are present ( Fig . 6 ) .
High water contents result in magmas becoming saturated with the aqueous phase , into which the ore metals can partition efficiently ; and high oxidation state suppresses magmatic sulfide , such as pyrrhotite , precipitation , a process that may cause sequestration of metals before they can partition into the aqueous phase .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au and , less commonly , distal Au and / or Zn - Pb skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .

A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al .

Whether or not these and other deposit clusters and alignments owe their existence to fundamental faults or lineaments ( see above ; Richards , 2000 ) , it is often not obvious if exploration - commonly focused on areas of pre - or postmineral cover - should target broadly equidimensional deposit arrays or arc - parallel or arc - transverse alignments , particularly when only one or two deposits have been defined .
Notwithstanding the ubiquity of porphyry Cu belts , major deposits may also occur in isolation or at least as distant outliers of coherent belts and provinces ( e . g . , Pebble in Alaska , Butte in Montana , and Bingham in Utah ; Sillitoe , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) .
This situation implies that the underlying parental plutons have protracted life spans , albeit intermittent in some cases , with porphyry Cu formation taking place above them at different places over time .
Light stable isotope studies of sodic - calcic alteration in the Yerington district support the involvement of externally derived brine from the host sedimentary sequence , although the albite - actinolite alteration there is magnetite destructive ( Carten , 1986 ; .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .

If this scenario is correct , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity ( 5−20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Therefore , recognition of even weakly developed mineralization of a single type may help to direct exploration for potentially higher grade mineralization of other types elsewhere in the system .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .

Narrow , mineralogically complex quartz - sericite - K - feldspar - biotite veinlets with centimeterscale halos defined by the same minerals ( ± andalusite ± corundum ) along with abundant , finely disseminated chalcopyrite ± bornite characterize the changeover from group 1 to 2 veinlets in a few deposits , although they may have been confused elsewhere with D - type veinlets because of their eye - catching halos ; they are termed early dark micaceous ( EDM ) halo veinlets at Butte ( Meyer , 1965 ; Brimhall , 1977 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) and Bingham ( Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and type 4 ( T4 ) veinlets at Los Pelambres ( Atkinson et al . , 1996 ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) .

The A - type veinlets range from stockworks to subparallel , sheeted arrays , the latter particularly common in Au - rich porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
There is a strong suggestion that comagmatic volcanism may be inhibited in some major porphyry Cu belts as a result of their characteristic contractional tectonic settings , as in the FIG .
Mining and deep drilling in a few large porphyry Cu deposits show that mineralized intrusions have vertical extents of > 2 km ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida , northern Chile , and Grasberg ) and , based on evidence from the steeply tilted systems , perhaps ≥4 km ( Dilles , 1987 ; Seedorff et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity of veining , alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .

However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .

However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large , albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .

This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature , pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .

Where steeply dipping , receptive carbonate rock sequences abut steep porphyry stock contacts , vertically extensive proximal skarn bodies may form ( e . g . , the > 1 , 600 - m extent of the Ertsberg East ( Gunung Bijih ) Cu - Au deposit , Indonesia ; Coutts et al . , 1999 ) .
In a minority of cases , however , diatremes ( e . g . , Grasberg , Galore Creek , and Boyongan - Bayugo , Philippines ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Enns et al . , 1995 ; Braxton et al . , 2008 ) or tuff - filled depressions presumably fed by one or more subjacent diatremes ( e . g . , Resolution ) are early features that act as receptive wall rocks to the main alteration and mineralization .
At the early stage ( left side ) , magma is present at the top of the parental chamber , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid exits the magma and undergoes phase separation during ascent to generate immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor , which generate potassic alteration plus contained low sulfidation - state porphyry Cu ± Au mineralization .

The empirical relationship between well - established magmatic ( including postcollisional ) arcs containing major , highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits and contractional tectonic settings characterized by high surface uplift and denudation rates ( see above ) may prove to be a useful criterion for selection of underexplored arc segments with incompletely tested potential . Contractional settings are strongly suggested where entire arc segments possess only minor volcanic rock volumes contemporaneous with the development of porphyry Cu systems , particularly where lithocaps are widely preserved as evidence for shallow erosion .
The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size , grade , and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems .
The clustering or alignment of both porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits has been shown time and again to be a highly effective exploration concept .
Nevertheless , it also characterizes the centrally located zones of some porphyry Cu stocks ( e . g . , Koloula , Solomon Islands and Island Copper , British Columbia ; Chivas , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995 ; Arancibia and Clark , 1996 ) .
Furthermore , even where appreciable Au is retained in chlorite - sericite assemblages , flotation recoveries are commonly lower ( < 60 % ) than for ore from potassic zones ( > 80 % ) because some of the Au originally in solid solution and encapsulated in and attached to chalcopyrite ± bornite becomes linked to introduced pyrite ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
The alteration - mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren , early sodic - calcic through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic , to advanced argillic , the last of these constituting the lithocaps , which may attain > 1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion .
They span a range of compositions from calc - alkaline diorite and quartz diorite through granodiorite to quartz monzonite ( monzogranite ) , and alkaline diorite through monzonite to , uncommonly , syenite ( e . g . , Galore Creek , British Columbia ; Enns et al . , 1995 ) .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , skarn Cu ± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts with less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .

It also needs to be emphasized that few porphyry Cu systems , whatever their exposure level , contain the full spectrum of potential ore types depicted in Figure 6 , although the Bingham district with its porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and sediment - hosted Au deposits ( Babcock et al . , 1995 ) and the more shallowly exposed Lepanto district with its porphyry Cu - Au , high - sulfidation Cu - Au - Ag , and intermediate - sulfidation Au - Ag - Cu deposits ( Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) are exceptionally well endowed in this regard .

The largest concentrations of peripheral Zn , Pb , and Ag are confined to systems hosted by receptive carbonate rocks , where fluid neutralization induces the precipitation of these metals in skarn and carbonate - replacement deposits ( Seward and Barnes , 1997 ) .

Varied relationships are observed between porphyry Cu systems and precursor plutons , which are typically multiphase , equigranular intrusions , commonly of batholithic dimensions and dioritic to granitic compositions ; they are not only spatially , but also temporally and probably genetically related to porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au formation ( Fig . 4 ) .
At the deposit scale , particularly in the por - phyry Cu environment , early - formed features commonly , but by no means always , give rise to the best ore - bodies .

The main geochemical difference between the Cu - Au zones in porphyry Cu deposits and those in the overlying lithocaps is the elevated As ( ± Sb ) contents consequent upon the abundance of the Cu sulfosalts in the latter .
This scenario implies episodic but focused magma and fluid ascent for as long as ~ 5 m . y .
Current orthodoxy maintains that the early sodic - calcic alteration observed in some porphyry Cu deposits is a product of inflowing brine sourced from host - rock sequences ( Carten , 1986 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005Seedorff et al . , , 2008 , in keeping with theoretical predictions for fluids following heating paths under silicate - rock−buffered conditions ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1984Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Under these lower temperature conditions , sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration zones begin to form from a deeply derived , single - phase aqueous liquid generated by one or both of the methods ( see text ) postulated by and Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) .

The fluid most likely to lead to appreciable high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu mineralization in the relatively barren , earlyformed lithocaps is the low - to moderate - salinity , H 2 S - rich , aqueous liquid that produces the underlying sericitic zones Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Fig . 14 ) .

See text for further details and Table 2 for alteration - mineralization details .
Where telescoping is limited , however , the lithocaps and potassic - altered porphyry stocks may be separated by 0 . 5 to 1 km ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , a gap typically occupied by pyritic chlorite - sericite alteration ( Fig . 11 ) .
Locally , early A - type veinlets displaying aplitic centers or along - strike transitions to aplite and / or aplite porphyry ( vein dikes ) are observed ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Heithersay et al . , 1990 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .

In the more highly telescoped systems , where sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages overprint appreciable volumes of potassic and / or chlorite - sericite alteration within porphyry intrusions , the ensuing effects can be varied .
These transverse features , possibly reflecting underlying basement structures , may facilitate ascent of the relatively small magma volumes involved in porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , Clark , 1993 ; Richards , 2000 ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich , Mopoor porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
( 11 ) what is the fluid regime responsible for metal zoning in lithocaps , and why are so many lithocaps apparently barren ?
Group 1 and 2 veinlets are mainly emplaced during potassic alteration , whereas group 3 accompanies the chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and deep advanced argillic overprints .
Open - space filling is also uncommon , except in phreatic breccias and unusual , isolated veins ( e . g . , La Mejicana alunite - pyrite - famatinite vein at Nevados del Famatina ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , exploration should focus first around their peripheries in case a porphyry Cu deposit has already been exposed .
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles are dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .

The same situation is also apparent in several giant high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits generated in thickened crust during tectonic uplift , such as Pascua - Lama and Veladero , northern Chile - Argentina , where the near absence of contemporaneous volcanism is more certain ( Bissig et al . , 2001 ; Charchaflié et al . , 2007 ) given the much shallower erosion level , including partial paleosurface preservation ( see below ) .

Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias display a variety of textures ( Table 1 ) , which are mainly dependent on clast form and composition , clast / matrix ratio , matrix / cement constitution , and alteration type .
Therefore recognition of A - and B - type veinlets in sericitic or advanced argillic zones testifies unambiguously to the former presence of potassic alteration .
Even cursory inspection of Figure 6 shows clearly that erosion level is a fundamental control on the mineralization types that may be anticipated to occur in porphyry Cu systems .
Note scale difference between c and a , b , and d . The precursor plutons are considered as the mid - to uppercrustal crystallization sites of mafic to felsic magmas that ascended from deeper reservoirs before porphyry Cu systems were developed ( see Richards , 2003 ) .
( 9 ) what are the main mechanisms controlling the bulk Cu / Au / Mo ratios of porphyry Cu deposits ?
At first glance , using representative cross sections of alteration at four highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits as examples ( Fig . 15 ) , these varied geometries are not easy to relate to a standard geologic model .
Note the common absence of B - and D - type veinlets from Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks and M - , magnetite - bearing A - , and chlorite - rich veinlets from Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Renewed neutralization of this same liquid on exiting the lithocap and / or aliquots of the deep liquid that bypass the lithocap entirely may give rise to peripheral intermediate - sulfidation ( IS ) epithermal mineralization .
As a consequence , the most distal and subtle ore types , sediment - hosted Au on the fringes of carbonate rockhosted districts and Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au−bearing intermediatesulfidation epithermal veins and carbonate - replacement bodies on the fringes of lithocaps attract less attention and may be easily missed .
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that certain lithologic units may enhance grade development in both porphyry Cu and related deposit types .
The early , intermineral , and late - mineral phases of the porphyry Cu stocks , which span the interval during which the porphyry Cu deposits formed , originate from increasingly greater depths in the progressively crystallizing parental chamber .
Field observations and theoretical calculations suggest that parental chambers with volumes on the order of 50 km 3 may be capable of liberating enough fluid to form porphyry Cu deposits , but chambers at least an order of magnitude larger are needed to produce giant systems , particularly where deposit clusters or alignments exist ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The degree of overprinting is perhaps best appreciated in some magmatichydro thermal breccia bodies in which isolated magnetite aggregates occur as stranded remnants in sericitic or chloritesericite zones up to 1 km above the magnetite - cemented , potassic parts ( e . g . , Chimborazo , northern Chile ; Fig . 8 ) .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high temperatures and oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .

Nevertheless , several temporally discrete porphyry Cu - bearing arcs may be superimposed on PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS 5 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 A preeminent example of spatial and temporal coincidence between a porphyry Cu belt and an intra - arc fault zone : the northern Chile part of the central Andean middle Eocene to early Oligocene porphyry Cu belt and Domeyko fault system ( summarized from Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit , northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Furthermore , there seems to be no obvious relationship between the size of porphyry Cu deposits and the duration of the intrusive activity , the latter seemingly being the main parameter defining the total hydrothermal life spans of porphyry Cu systems .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite ± chalcocite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .

Isotopic dating , using the U - Pb zircon method , suggests that the multiphase porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu systems can be assembled in as little as 80 , 000 years ( Batu Hijau , Indonesia ; Garwin , 2002 ) , but the process commonly takes much longer .
It is unlikely coincidental that at least half the ore at three of the highest grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits is hosted by such rocks : a gabbro - diabase - basalt complex at El Teniente ( Skewes et al . , 2002 ) , a Proterozoic diabase sill complex at Resolution , Arizona ( Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) , and a tholeiitic basalt sequence in the Oyu Tolgoi district .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .

Arranged from probable oldest ( top ) to youngest ( bottom ) , except for propylitic that is lateral equivalent of potassic ; advanced argillic also forms above potassic early in systems ( Fig . 10 ) 3 Many veinlets in potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alteration contain anhydrite , which also occurs as late , largely monomineralic veinlets particularly , advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2002 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ) .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large , high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; Perelló et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Perelló , 2006 ) .

However , at the shallower depths typical of most deposits ( < ~ 4 km ) , the mineralization is introduced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction of hypersaline liquid ( brine ) and a much larger volume of lowdensity vapor ( Fournier , 1999 ) , produced by either direct exsolution from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more typically , as the single - phase liquid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Cline , 1995 ) .

And these geologic observations must further emphasize the relative timing of intrusion , brecciation , alteration , and mineralization events because isotopic dating techniques do not and may never have the required resolution .

Some investigators emphasize the importance of intersections between continentscale transverse fault zones or lineaments and arc - parallel structures for porphyry Cu formation , with the Archibarca and Calama - El Toro lineaments of northern Chile ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 2 ) , the Lachlan Transverse Zone of New South Wales ( Glen and Walshe , 1999 ) , comparable features in New Guinea ( Corbett , 1994 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , and the much wider ( 160 km ) Texas lineament of southwestern North America ( Schmitt , 1966 ) being oft - quoted examples .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .

However , USTs are not consistently developed and , hence , do not provide a reliable means of subdividing porphyry Cu intrusion phases .

However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Irrespective of whether the porphyry Cu systems and contained deposits define clusters or alignments , their surface distributions are taken to reflect the areal extents of either underlying parental plutons or cupolas on their roofs .
range from restricted veneers near the stock or dike contacts to kilometer - scale zones , such as those in the mafic host lithologic units mentioned previously at El Teniente , Resolution , and Oyu Tolgoi .
But more fundamentally , however , we require better and more detailed documentation of geologic relationships in porphyry Cu systems worldwide , at all scales from the thin section to the entire system , and with greater emphasis on the regional to district context , particularly the relationship to igneous evolution .
Note that the high - grade ( > 1 . 5 % Cu ) zone at Chuquicamata includes a substantial , but unquantified , contribution from supergene enrichment .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .

The Bingham , Island Copper , and Agua Rica , Argentina , porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are exceptions to this generalization because of their deep , centrally located molybdenite zones ( John , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995Perelló et al . , , 1998 .
Nevertheless , many systems contain only one or two deposit types rather than a full zonal array ( Table 3 ) , with the presence of the more distal ore types at either porphyry Cu or lithocap levels being independent of the size and grade of the porphyry Cu deposits or prospects .
Notwithstanding the typical occurrence model depicted in Figure 6 and taking into account the critical importance of erosion level , the innumerable variations on the porphyry Cu genetic theme result in a broad spectrum of three - dimensional intrusion , breccia , alteration , and mineralization geometries ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
It is acquisition of this geologic detail that is going to enable better application of laboratory techniques and , hopefully , further clarify the localization and evolutionary histories of porphyry Cu systems as well as the fundamental controls on large size and high hypogene grade .
For example , the 12 . 5 - Gt resource at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic is confined to the 14 - km - long stock referred to above ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Camus , 2003 ) , whereas perhaps only roughly 20 percent of the similarly sized El Teniente deposit and < 10 percent of the 1 . 5 - Gt El Abra deposit are hosted by the porphyry intrusions ( Camus , 1975 ( Camus , , 2003Ambrus , 1977 ) .
To date , the second choice could be taken to have been less successful , as shown by the lack of economically significant discoveries in the vicinities of the major but isolated Bingham , Butte , Pebble , and Oyu Tolgoi districts , although greenfield exploration is in its infancy in the still poorly defined magmatic arcs that host the last two of these .
Partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust and / or sediments may occur under some restricted conditions , but is unlikely to be a widespread process ( in Phanerozoic arcs ) , and does not significantly differ metallogenically from slab - dehydration processes .

Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .

Xenoliths from supra - subduction zone mantle ( McInnes et al . , 1999 ) and samples of mafic cumulates from lower crustal arc roots ( Fig . 5 ; Canil et al . , 2010 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2007 ) reveal the common presence of small amounts of sulfide , typically trapped as inclusions in silicate phases ( suggesting a primary magmatic rather than secondary hydrothermal origin ) .

Collisional orogens commonly undergo crustal thickening followed by extensional or transpressional collapse .
Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Magmas may be characterized by high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the presence of hornblende ( ± garnet , titanite ) in the amphibolitic lower crustal source rocks .

Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Porphyry Cu ore formation
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

At R - factors below ~ 10 2 , magmas will be depleted in both Cu and Au .
At R - factors between ~ 10 2 - 10 5 , magmas will be depleted in Au but essentially undepleted in Cu ( porphyry Cu - potential magmas ) .

In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive δ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .

The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .

The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

Such magmas , they argued , should be particularly suitable for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry copper deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .
Such sulfides would have retained significant amounts of the subduction flux of Cu and Mo , but HSE would be diluted to low concentrations by the greater volume of sulfide ( low R - factor ; Fig . 2 ) .

These trace element characteristics are therefore an indicator of high magmatic water content rather than being a source signature , and this likely explains the common association of high - Sr / Y ( i . e . , hydrous ) magmas with magmatic - hydrothermal ore depositswithout magmatic water , such deposits cannot form .

These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .

Such magmas therefore have the potential subsequently to form porphyry Cu - Mo deposits .
Such magmatic - metallogenic systems are thought to form by remelting of previously subductionmodified upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate roots of former arc magmatic complexes .
These fluid - mobile components are also characteristically enriched in arc magmas ( e . g . , typical ranges of : 1 - 3 wt . % H 2 O , 500 - 2000 ppm Cl , 900 - 2500 ppm S ; Davidson , 1996 ; Gill , 1981 ; Noll et al . , 1996 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) , which is taken as evidence of aqueous fluid metasomatism of the mantle wedge magma source .

At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .

Under lower f S2 post - subduction conditions ( a flux of S from the subduction zone is no longer present ) , any residual sulfide phases would likely dissolve into the S - undersaturated silicate melt , carrying their metal loads with them ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ) .

These granites tend to be enriched in lithophile rather than chalcophile elements , reflecting their crustal origins , and may generate magmatic - hydrothermal deposits containing Sn , W , U , Mo , REE , Li , Be , B , and F .
( a ) Porphyry Cu ± Mo deposits formed in normal arc settings ; a continental arc is shown , but similar processes can occur in mature island arcs .
These high observed metal solubilities are consistent with or exceed experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on chloride complexing alone ( e . g . , Holland , 1984 , 1986 ) , and suggest that other volatile ligands such as sulfide species may enhance the solubility of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in high temperature aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz et al . , 2008Zajacz et al . , , 2011 .

Given suitable fluid flow focusing , three further factors combine to cause maximum efficiency of metal deposition within relatively small volumes in porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits .
Thus , mineralization may only occur where later moderate salinity liquids have followed a higher pressure , rather specialized cooling path , as described above ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ) .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .

Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .

argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .

In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .

Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .

In addition to volatiles , water - soluble large ion lithophile elements ( LILE : K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , and Ba , and U ) , and B , Pb , As , and Sb ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ; Hattori et al . , 2005 ; Hattori and Guillot , 2003 ; Kogiso et al . , 1997 ; Manning , 2004 ; Tatsumi et al . , 1986 ) are thought to be mobilized into the forearc mantle wedge by dehydration fluids , which may then be convected by corner - flow into the sub - arc melting zone ( Fig . 1 ) .
The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .

Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .

When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

The question of whether the downgoing oceanic slab , or more specifically the basaltic oceanic crust , melts during subduction has prompted lively debate recently , not only in the petrology literature ( e . g . , Conrey , 2002 ; Kepezhinskas , 2001 , 2002 ; Garrison and Davidson , 2003 ) , but also amongst economic geologists because of the suggestion that " slab melts " might in some way be uniquely fertile for later porphyry ore formation ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Oyarzun et al . , , 2002Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Thiéblemont et al . , 1997 ; for contrary opinions , see : Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition of Cu and Mo ± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( Audétat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the Roşia Montană epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .

As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu ± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 °C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425° - 320 °C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .
Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .

Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .

These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3× ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .

( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .

Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

Along the same lines , Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed that the unusual Cu - Mo - Au endowment of the southwestern USA ( e . g . , the giant Bingham , Butte , Climax , Henderson , and Questa porphyry Cu - Mo - Au and porphyry - Mo deposits ) reflects Cenozoic remobilization of Proterozoic subduction - metasomatized subcontinental mantle lithosphere ( see Section 2 . 5 ) .

However , Dietrich et al . ( 1999 ) have suggested a possible role for mantle - derived magmas in triggering volatile ( and metal ) release from evolved , felsic magmas in the Bolivian tin belt , and Walshe et al . ( 2011 ) have identified a mantle Nd isotopic signature in tin granites from eastern Australia .
Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .

Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400° - 500 °C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al .

Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400° - 350 °C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 °C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .

In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .

Porphyry deposits supply most of the world ' s Cu and Mo resources .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .

Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide silicate melts .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2− ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2− ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations , forming sulfur - undersaturated magmas that can further assimilate sulfides during ascent .
Copper , Mo and Au act as incompatible elements in sulfide undersaturated magmas , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently , driving the oxidation potential of sulfate up to the hematite - magnetite oxygen fugacity ( HM ) buffer , which is ~ ΔFMQ + 4 .
Degassing of oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .
Degassing oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .
Sulfide formed during sulfate reduction is efficiently scavenged by aqueous fluids , which transports metals to shallower depths , i . e . , the top of the porphyry and superjacent wallrock .

Porphyry deposits are hosts to one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , accounting for ~ 80 % Cu and ~ 95 % Mo of the world ' s total reserves .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability of minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Oxygen fugacity is of critical importance for the behaviors of elements .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .

Sulfates , including anhydrite and alunite ( likely related to the epithermal mineralization ) are abundant in the mineralization system , and hematite formed during chlorite alteration , indicating high oxygen fugacity up to the HM buffer ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Porphyry Au deposits have oxygen fugacities similar to , if not higher than , porphyry Cu deposits .
El Teniente is a nested porphyry system that , according to different authors , was active for ~ 1 Ma ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Cannell et al . , 2003 ) up to more than 7 Ma ( 14 . 2 - 6 . 5 Ma ) ( Barra , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2011 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .

Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , the behaviors of which are mainly controlled by reduced sulfur , e . g . , sulfide , hydrosulfide complexes ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or polysulfide ( e . g . , S 2 2− , S 3 − ) complexes ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Sulfur oxidation , sulfide under saturation and residual sulfide
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts formed at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 and ΔFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Slab melts formed at ΔFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ΔFMQ 0 ) .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Sulfate reduction
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation during magma chamber development may be better mixed and more homogenized .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .

Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Ridge subduction forms oxidized adakites by slab melting ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Ling et al . , 2009Ling et al . , , 2013 , followed by reduced A - type granites ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; H . Li et al . , 2012 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1994 ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
crystallizes below 950 °C in silicic calc - alkaline magmas ( Green and Watson , 1982 ) .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Low - salinity vapor shows strong seawater signals , which cannot represent " degassing " fluids .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .

Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .

Magnetite crisis
Fluid extraction , however , is different from degassing , and thus Se provides no constraints on the process .

The reduced porphyry deposits range in age from the Late Archean to the Oligocene ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The Catface porphyry may have ascended through and interacted with graphite - rich reducing country rock known to exist in the region ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .
The assimilation model , however , does not contradict with a deep mantle source for the S , Pb , nor Cu .
The H isotopes of fluid inclusions from Baogutu have very low δD values ( Shen et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , which are much lower than for either magmatic fluids or metamorphic fluids ( Fig . 21 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The systematically lighter H coupled with a slightly lighter O can best be explained by the addition of meteoritic water .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The total iron ( expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) content ranges from 2 . 25 wt . % to 5 . 53 wt . % for the Catface porphyry .
One carbon atom reduces 4 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .
The Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with a nearby pluton on Mt Washington ( 35 - 41 Ma ) , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

The mantle derived parent magmas of the Catface porphyry are expected to have been more reduced ( near the FMQ oxygen fugacity buffer ) and drier than the adakite , and to have a lower initial Cu contents .
The Baogutu adakites have been attributed to the mixing of ~ 95 % slab melt with 5 % sediment - derived melt in the Late Carboniferous close to a subducting spreading ridge ( Tang et al . , 2010 ) .

HDP = hornblende diorite porphyry ; GDP = Granodiorite porphyry ; D = diorite .
Many epithermal deposits , however , are not linked to porphyry deposits .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
If the magma at Catface was reduced during degassing of SO 3 , there should be compositional zonation in the apatite , which is not the case ( Fig . 20 ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Normal arc melts are not systematically more enriched in Cu than MORB , either ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

A small sulfur - ( N 3 wt . % ) and copper - rich ( N0 . 5 wt . % ) fine - grained igneous rock known as " Porphyry A " stock ( b1 km 3 , 6 . 09 ± 0 . 18 Ma ) ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) has abundant igneous anhydrite , with varied textures ranging from interstitial to poikilitic and corresponding modal abundances from 10 to 20 % , respectively .

Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .

Similar to Catface , there are also adakites in Baogutu .

There are porphyry ore deposits located at the southwestern Pacific margin , which , however , are much less developed in terms of tonnage and the number deposits .
Given that ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization , the highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic high potassium intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .

Instead of primary hematite , magnetite , and sulfate ( e . g . , anhydrite , gypsum ) that are frequently seen in oxidized porphyries , these " reduced " porphyry Cu - Au deposits contain abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and commonly have carbonic - rich ore fluids with substantial proportions of CH 4 , clearly indicating a reducing condition ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Most of the ferric Fe will be transferred into the melt because ferric Fe is more incompatible than ferrous Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .

Meanwhile , sulﬁde undersaturated during the evolution of oxidized magmas , such that no sulﬁde segregation is expected ( Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , Cu , Mo and Au act as moderately incompatible ele - ments ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ; Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , which become enriched during the early stage of magma evolution , and suddenly go into magmatic ﬂuids during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013a ) .
Therefore , residual sulﬁdes are more efﬁciently destroyed at oxygen fugacities higher than FMQ + 2 , releasing their chalcophile elements ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

Most of the porphyry deposits , however , reach the HM buffer value during mineralization .
First , the oxygen fugacity of Ni - NiO is quite close to the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of the hydrothermal vessel ( NiNiO + 0 . 5 ) .

Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Some of the supergiant deposits may have large Mo reserves of several million tons ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Because the anhydrite - rich stock is isotopically similar to all the other igneous rocks of the late Miocene deposit ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) formed at a time of regional compressive deformation , it has been proposed that an oxidized parent magma in the large productive magma chamber was undergoing igneous fractionation at that time .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content at sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .

Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .

Meanwhile , sulfide is kept undersaturated during the evolution of the oxidized magma , such that no sulfide segregation occurs , and Cu , Mo , and Au act as moderately incompatible elements .
Therefore , the crystallization of magnetite and hematite tends to lower the proportions of ferric iron in the magma , which apparently would lower the oxygen fugacity .

Most of the hematite and / or specularite formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The further oxidation of magnetite is controlled by the pH values of the system ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , S 3 − may indeed cause more fluctuations in oxygen fugacities through a different reaction pathway , but it has no major influences on the final results ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It contains native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Meanwhile , Cu may be transported to distal sites through normal fluids .
Formation of reduced porphyry deposits
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Therefore , S - Pb isotopes cannot place any decisive constraints on the role of assimilation in forming the deposit .
Most of the C in magma occurs as CO 2 , therefore the oxygen buffer changes from graphite - CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria as the magma ascends ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) .

Most of the hydrogen and methane should have been oxidized by ferric Fe .
In general , porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have FeO contents systematically lower than porphyry Cu , but higher than pure porphyry Mo deposits , with oxygen fugacities also falling between them ( Fig . 8 ) .
Mainly , the sulfur speciation in magmas is controlled by oxygen fugacity .
All types of porphyry deposits , ranging from Cu + Au , Cu + Mo , and Mo deposits , may be oxidized sufficiently to reach the redox states of the HM buffer .

Evidence for reduced magma in the Baogutu porphyry deposit
Then , how do reduced magmas get enriched in Cu ?
For example , graphite and diamond are stable in the deep mantle .
However , at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , ~ 5 - 10 % of partial melting is enough to eliminate residual sulfide from the subducted oceanic crust , forming adakitic melts with high Cu and S contents up to 2000 ppm and percent levels , respectively .

For example , Cenozoic porphyry deposits located in island arcs in the southwestern Pacific are all Cu - Au deposits , e . g . , Grasberg and Batu Hijau in Indonesia ; Panguna and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea ; Lepanto - Far South East , Tampakan , Atlas and Sipilay in the Philippines ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .

The supergiant El Teniente deposit in Chile is the largest porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit in the world , with total reserves of ~ 109 Mt Cu @0 . 92 % , 2 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 02 % and 437 t Au @0 . 035 g / t ( Table 1 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
The estimated Cu abundance in the primitive mantle is 30 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , whereas the Cu concentrations in MORB so far published range from 70 to 150 ppm ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) .
In contrast , metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require low oxygen fugacity for their stabilization during the final stage of mineralization .
In contrast , sulfate reduction in magmas does not change the pH , such that the oxygen fugacity is slightly reduced .

For example , ilmenite is an end - member of the hematite - ilmenite solid solutions with a very low hematite component , varying from X Hem ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 ) , for the Catface phase and X Hem ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 09 ) for the Hecate Bay phase ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

In contrast , reduced magmas usually retain residual sulfides , such that they have low primary Cu contents ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
First , lower Cu and Au contents would first result in lower grade , not necessarily smaller tonnages .
The grades of porphyry Cu and Au deposits associated with reduced magmas are comparable to , if not higher than , those associated with oxidized magmas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rowins , 2000 ) .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .
We infer that large proportions of these adakites are still buried due to the dramatically lessened compression , uplifting and erosion following ridge subduction .

In contrast , oceanic crust has sulfur abundances of over 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , which is about 4 times greater than the primitive mantle value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) .
The amount of H + released during mineralization ( e . g . , Eqs .
For example , sericitic and advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe and Burrows , 2002 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

Nevertheless , porphyry deposits are usually mineralized in the whole upper portion of the pluton , whereas interactions with country rocks are generally restricted at the interface , therefore assimilation of reducing sediments is not likely to be a decisive controlling process .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .

All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .

Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Nevertheless , assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries would result in heterogeneous reduction , because reduction is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .

Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
In fact , most Cu should have come from slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , as also should have come the S and Pb , which are present in abundances similar to mantle derived magmas .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Therefore , the parental Catface magmas may have acquired a low fO 2 during their ascent through the crust .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Moreover , most mantle minerals olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Moreover , the crystallization of amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
There are also several ridges ( most of which are aseismic , i . e . , island chains ) on the western Pacific plate ( Fig . 28 ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .

Moreover , some porphyry deposits are apparently associated with reduced magmas at ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Intergrowths of hematite and magnetite ( Fig . 10 ) indicate the oxygen fugacity of Qulong reached the HM buffer .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
In contrast , at oxygen fugacity even only slightly lower , e . g . , ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , the highest Cu contents that can be reached through slab melting is ~ 450 ppm .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Therefore , the reduced Catface porphyry is likely to be a country rock that only hosts the deposit .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .

Based on similar Zn / Fe T ratios of mantle peridotite and primitive arc magmas , it has been argued that primary arc magmas are not necessarily oxidized ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
Considering the geotherm ' s concave downward shape of subducting slabs , ridge subduction is the most favorable tectonic setting for slab melting in the Phanerozoic .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .

Shapinggou . The Shapinggou porphyry Mo deposit is the largest
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
When there is no residual sulfide in the mantle source , Cu and also other chalcophile elements become highly incompatible ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .

There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .

Also shown is the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , thick horizontal orange line ; NNO and FMQ , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .

Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
In contrast , the oceanic plates subducting underneath the western North American continent are younger and have experienced only one Ocean Anoxic Event .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains the Au - rich capping feature of many reduced porphyry deposits .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Intrusions in the Vancouver Island range in age from 51 to 35 . 5 Ma ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , spanning the time during which the Kula - Farallon ridge collided with the continent .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .

There are several subducting ridges along the east Pacific margin , e . g . , in Chile and Peru in the South America .

In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with reduced magmas
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is followed by emplacement the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
The uniform and low SO 3 contents in apatite from reduced magma deposits were used to argue that the low oxygen fugacity of these porphyries is primary ( Fig . 20 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .

At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .

Stability domains of trisulfur ion S 3 − at total dissolved sulfur concentrations of 1 wt . % and 0 . 1 wt . % are shown .
It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Evidence for reduced magmas of Catface porphyry deposit
The formation of the Catface porphyry deposit
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

The lower portion of argillic lithocaps may overprint the upper parts of the porphyry Cu deposits , whereas the sericitic alteration transforms upwardly to quartz - pyrophyllite .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .

There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
Experiments show that sulfate is much more soluble than sulfide in magmas .
Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
More accurately , the ferrous Fe in fluids reacts with water , releasing H 2 and H + ( Eq .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It may also constitute ore Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bΔFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ΔFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
This implies that such porphyry deposits themselves are not genetically related to reduced magmas , i . e . , they are not the causative magma , but the host rock .
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .

This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .

Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulﬁde .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .

The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .

In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea floor alteration .
Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
They are associated with carbonic - rich ore forming fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , and multiple intrusive events ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 ≥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 ≥ 15 wt . % , Y ≤ 18 ppm , Yb ≤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr ≥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The question is again why normal arc rocks in compressed environments do not form porphyry deposits .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ΔFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayalite–magnetite– quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .

No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .

It is very likely that the preferential enrichments Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .
What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
Some workers proposed that ΔFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ΔFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
This is one reason why the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magma did not change much ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or even decrease slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( see also Section 5 ) .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .

Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature of the magmas .

Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature magmas .
One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .

It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Among them are degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .

Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .

As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .

It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .

It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .

Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .

( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate oxidation potential of sulfate .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ΔFMQ − 1 and 1500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .

This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has long been proposed that oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 have reached the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
More importantly , compared to oxidized magmas , reduced magmas indeed have lower sulfur contents with S 2− occurring as the dominant sulfur species ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , but this does not necessarily mean higher S 2− in reduced magmas as claimed by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .

Some experiments suggest that D Mo increases with decreasing oxygen fugacities ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ΔFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .

From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .

We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ﬂuids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For example , there are also many porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( without economic levels of Mo ) in the western American continents , including some of the world ' s top 25 largest porphyry deposits , e . g . , Cerro Casale in Chile ; Minas Conga in Peru ; Bajo de la Alumbrera in Argentina ; Pebble Copper in the USA ; and Prosperity in Canada .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .

More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
This can best be explained by the reduction of Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .

As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S at sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This is probably mainly because the crust in backarc basins is too thin .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .

It has long been proposed that most porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013b , also known as the magnetite - series magmas ( Ishihara and Terashima , 1989 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The addition of subduction released oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to arc magmas is proposed as the most straightforward way , e . g . , water ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , oxidizing fluids and / or melts ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) , fluids with oxidizing components , e . g . , hematite , sulfate ( X . M .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Baogutu is located in West Junggar , Central Asian Orogenic Belt , and is the second largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , with controlled reserves of 0 . 63 Mt Cu @ 0 . 28 wt . % , 14 t Au @ 0 . 1 ppm , 1 . 8 × 10 4 t Mo @ 0 . 011 wt . % and 390 t Ag @ 1 . 8 ppm ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
Previous studies suggested that these magmas are a product of continental arc - style magmatism ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
Some researchers have even argued that Cu comes from the mantle , whereas Mo comes from the continental crust ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .
Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .
There are several ways to describe the oxidation of ferrous Fe .
There are several ways to describe the oxidation ferrous Fe .
Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Baogutu is located in the center of the Eurasian continent .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
Experiments with apatite have shown that SO 3 contents reflect the oxygen fugacity of the magmas ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( ± Au and ± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher ε Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .

Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
A similar model has been proposed based on geochemical and mineralogical studies by Shen and Pan ( 2013 ) , in which mineral composition data suggest that the primary magma of the Baogutu porphyry deposit is oxidized .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
Therefore , it does not require very high oxygen fugacities to eliminate residual sulfides .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
It is not clear whether the portion of the subducting slab underneath Qulong was continental or oceanic .

( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction of S 3 − ( Eq .
( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction S 3 − ( Eq .
This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
We propose that the reduced features of the Baogutu porphyry deposit are secondary and occurred during emplacement , thus having no major influence on the mineralization process .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
It has also been proposed that degassing of SO 2 may lower the oxygen fugacity ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .

The most straightforward way to elevate the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is by the addition of oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to the magmas .

In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .

The geodynamic and architectural controls on porphyry formation in this complex tectonic zone are unclear ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .

Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
Similar to El Teniente , the formation of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposits also lasted for several million years , between 36 and 31 Ma ( Ballard et al . , 2001 ; Ossandon et al . , 2001 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This was interpreted as the main evidence for degassing ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .

This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .

Further studies are needed on the formation of Sar - Cheshmeh and other Cenozoic porphyry deposits in the belt .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
During a period of recharge by mantle - derived mafic magmas into the base of the chamber and associated volatile transfer and concentration near its roof , the opportunity arose to produce the Cu - and S - rich magmas that formed the anhydrite - bearing intrusive rocks ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
Therefore , it is essential to eliminate residual sulfides to get high Cu contents in magmas for the formation of porphyry deposits .

Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

In principle , there are several ways to lower the oxygen fugacities during magma evolution .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .

Several different explanations for the fertility of adakitic slab melts have been proposed : Oxidized .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values defined by the HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .

This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .

It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
This plausibly explains the common association between high - Mg adakites and porphyry Cu deposits .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .

As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
Degassing , however , is not likely to be a main process in porphyry mineralization that occurs at 2 - 4 km depths in the upper crust .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .

Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .

Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .

CH 4 þ 4Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 8FeO þ CO 2 þ 2H 2 Oð29Þ Considering that the Catface porphyry is not adakitic , it may well be simply the country rock that hosts the deposit .
All the samples with the exception of two were collected from the diorite , which are not porphyry at all .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .

It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaﬁei et al . , 2009 ) .
The orange field between HM and ΔFMQ + 2 is the optimum condition for porphyry Cu , Au , Mo mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
C þ 2Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 4FeO þ CO 2ð28Þ Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Potassic alteration is located in the center and deeper portions of the porphyry .
The problem with this model is that no studies have ever demonstrated that adakites are more hydrous than normal arc rocks .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
The distribution of porphyry deposits does not support the premise that the Cu comes from the mantle .
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It has been further proposed that in general geological processes where the tri - sulfur ion may have been involved need to be reconsidered ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , and this would require the investigation of different reaction pathways ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) ) together with alkali contents in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alteration ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
It is located in the western Dabie Mountains , along the east extension of the East Qinling Mo mineralization belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; H . Y .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .

This was attributed to sulfate buffering ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , i . e . , the oxidation of ferrous iron is coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide ( Eqs .

This process , however , was excluded from further consideration based on the low 87 Sr / 86 Sr of Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .

Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , subduction of reducing sediments is not a plausible explanation for the low fO 2 shown by the Catface porphyry .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

It is located in southwestern Iran and is associated with several intrusive pulses of Miocene stocks ( ~ 12 . 2 Ma ) ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) , ranging in composition from diorite through granodiorite to quartzmonzonite ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
Based on the above discussion , we propose the following model for the formation of the Catface porphyry .
As pointed out by the authors , detailed studies are needed to clarify the origin of the CH 4 .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .

Because of these uncertainties , it has been asserted that there is no single , obvious reason why slab melts have an unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits ( Richards , 2013 ) .
Second , there is no systematic difference in terms of emplacement depths and tectonic settings between reduced and oxidized porphyry deposits .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .

The total resources there are estimated to be N1 . 8 billion tons , accounting for about 60 % of the world ' s total Cu resource estimation ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .

Their contribution depends heavily on subsequent oxidation , i . e . , a major contribution can be expected only when the sulfide cumulates are oxidized to sulfate , liberating the chalcophile elements .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

Nevertheless , the oxygen fugacity undoubtedly fluctuated during porphyry mineralization ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , and the hydrothermal rutile only records the oxygen fugacities under which it crystallized .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .
Li et al . , 2012 ; Han et al . , 2013 ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; Zhu et al . , 2010 ) , to the north of the Triassic suture between the north and south China blocks ( Sun et al . , 2002 ) .
Consistently , the Mo / Cu ratios of these deposits are generally more than 20 times higher than the primitive mantle ratio value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , suggesting that Mo has been added to the porphyry deposits from different sources .

Late alteration and mineralization are characterized muscovite + quartz alteration and is related to D - type veins .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .

For pyrite from the same mineralization stage , different samples show more or less different trace element distributions and even a single pyrite crystal may contain different levels of trace elements .
The multifractal analysis of elemental micro - distributions on scale of pyrite crystal surfaces were employed to allow quantitative insights into the geometrical organization of these elements .
All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
The elemental spectra differ , probably as a consequence of different genetic and intrinsic processes , which are part of the general scenario for ore - forming events on hydrothermal vein systems .
The ∆α and ∆αL values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .

This multifractal procedure has been used to characterize variability of many natural phenomena , including characteristics of mineralization and mineral deposits ( Carlson , 1991 ; Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Sanderson et al . , 1994 ; Agterberg , 1995 ; Turcotte , 1997 , 2002 ; Gumiel et al . , 2010 ; Arias et al . , 2011 ) .
Local metal enriched rocks can become an ore body that can be mined at an economic profit .
Several multifractal parameters were calculated , however , the most significant ones are ∆α and ∆αL .
A range of trace elements , including Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti were analyzed on the surface of pyrite crystals using ESEM .
This apparent multifractal behavior reveal that the spatial variability of studied element concentrations on surface of pyrite crystals from different veins and veinlets can be successfully correlated with the vein types and related alteration and mineralization zone delineated using other customized geological methods .

Therefore , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising to discriminate between mineralized veins developed during different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body .
In recent years , fractal and multifractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .

The trend towards a wide left branch for the main elements constituting the ore ( Cu , Fe and S ) and a fluctuating right branch of the f ( α ) spectrum can be readily recognized and indicates an increase in heterogeneity of the high values for the measure .
It is calculated as : R α = ( ∆α L - ∆α R ) / ( ∆α L + ∆α R ) ( Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2010b ) .

However , one single number for the fractal dimension , may not be sufficient to describe the complex and 3 heterogeneous behavior of spatial variation resulting from physical , chemical , or genetic processes .
These differences in the aperture of multifractal spectrum suggest a wide range of differences in the overall variability and in the heterogeneity of the studied element distributions which provide direct information on element behavior during crystallization and related differentiation processes .

A recently developed extension of the monofractal approach describes the data with a set of intertwining fractals of different fractal dimensions ( Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Cheng and Agterberg , 1996 ; Cheng , 1999 ; Agterberg , 2001b ; Panahi and Cheng , 2004 ) .
It is destroyed and overprinted by later alteration and mineralization .
This does not only contribute to obtain a full spectrum of element distributions at different scales , but should also provide a new way to characterize different vein types .
Based on this shape characterization , the multifractal distribution can be divided into two groups , one is the left - deviation ( ∆α L ) continuous multifractal mode , and the other is the right - deviation ( ∆α R ) mode ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) .

These parameters are found to be higher in the D - type veins related to late phyllic alteration and mineralization in comparison with other veins and vein systems , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are highly enriched in D - type veins .

This may provide a new insight into evaluation of ore - forming potential .
As can be seen in Table 2 and Figures 9 and 10 , the multifractal parameters created on the basis of element distribution values on mineral surfaces are not the same .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
This is consistent with field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis and previous investigations by other authors including Mao et al . ( 2011 ) , showing that the D - type veins are the most important for the mineralization in the Dexing porphyry deposit .
It is interesting to consider some other parameters like the variability ( V ) and the τ ( the mass exponent ) ( Cheng , 1999 ) .
Based on the analytical results and previous investigations , the vein systems within the deposit can be divided into four main types as follows : ( 1 ) early quartz veins ( A - type veins ) related to K - feldspar alteration ; ( 2 ) quartz - pyrite - molybdenite - chalcopyrite veins ( B - type veins ) related to chlorite + illite alteration ; ( 3 ) quartz - pyrite - chalcopyrite veins ( D - type veins ) related to late phyllic ( muscovite + quartz ) alteration ; and ( 4 ) the latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ( H - type veins ) .

The objectives of this work were firstly to identify different vein types , and secondly to evaluate the potential of multifractal parameters , constructed using the so - called method of moments , to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of concentration of elements on mineral surfaces which may provide insight into hydrothermal mineralization and its effect on spatial and temporal distribution of element concentration .
These parameters are indicators of symmetry / asymmetry of the multifractal system ( Montero , 2005 ; Miranda et al . , 2006 ; Arias et al . , 2012 ) .
Based on the analytical results and other previous investigations , the vein systems were divided into four main vein types and associated alteration and mineralization stages .
The objective of this study is to identify different vein types by means of detailed field , microscopic , X - Ray Diffraction ( XRD ) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy ( ESEM ) examinations , to reveal the micro - distribution of elements on the crystal surfaces of pyrites found in veins of different types .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body .
Most applications of fractal theory use the monofractal - approach , which assumes that the spatial distribution of an element or other property of an object can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .

Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
This result is consistent with previous research on the area as well as new field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis carried out for this study .
Carlson , 1991 ) , but little has been done on the concentration micro - distribution of elements at the crystal surfaces of major ore minerals ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
Tailings generated during processing of sulfide ores represent a substantial risk to water resources .
The oxidation of sulfide minerals within tailings deposits can generate low - quality water containing elevated concentrations of SO 4 , Fe , and associated metal ( loid ) s . Acid generated during the oxidation of pyrite [ FeS 2 ] , pyrrhotite S ] and other sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .

Acid generated during the oxidation of sulfide minerals is neutralized to varying degrees by the dissolution of carbonate , ( oxy ) hydroxide , and silicate minerals .
Metals including Fe ( III ) , Cu , Zn , and Ni often occur at high concentrations and exhibit greater mobility at low pH characteristic of acid mine drainage ( AMD ) .
Reduction - oxidation ( redox ) processes are another important control on metal ( loid ) mobility within sulfide tailings deposits .
Mining and processing of sulfide ores generates large volumes of waste materials that can have severe and widespread impacts on water resources ( España et al . , 2005 ; Concas et al . , 2006 ; Moncur et al . , 2006 , 2014 ; Pérez - López et al . , 2011 ) .
Sulfide ore deposits host globally significant amounts of Cu , Ni , Zn , Pb and other economically important metals .
Sulfide ore deposits are also important sources of Au and Ag , which may occur as native elements or be associated with sulfides .
Mill tailings are a principal solid waste generated at sulfide mining operations .
Sulfide ore minerals are generally concentrated by milling and froth flotation , which produces tailings containing gangue minerals and residual sulfides .
Anionic surfactants commonly used for sulfide flotation include xanthates and dithiophosphates .
The hydrophobic sulfide minerals attach by surface tension to the bubble interface and are transported vertically to 4 the surface of the flotation cell .
Silicates , carbonates and sulfides generally dominate the mineralogical assemblage of fresh tailings .
The sulfide mineral component includes both gangue minerals and residual ore minerals not extracted during concentration due to ineffective separation from the rock matrix .
Sulfide minerals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen and water .
Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of Fe - and S - oxidizing bacteria .

Rates of sulfide - mineral oxidation are controlled by several factors including oxygen availability , pore - water pH , and the activity of S - oxidizing bacteria .
The pH of tailings pore water and drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .
The pH tailings pore water and drainage is a principal control on dissolved concentrations of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation ( Heikkinen et al . , 2009 ; Nordstrom , 2011a , 2011b ; Smuda et al . , 2014 ) .

Acid mine drainage ( AMD ) develops in tailings deposits where the neutralization capacity of carbonate minerals is depleted due to ongoing 5 sulfide - mineral oxidation .
High dissolved concentrations of Fe and SO4 generated via sulfide oxidation can promote formation of hardpan layers comprised of Fe ( oxy ) hydroxides or ( hydroxy ) sulfates .
Redox reactions can strongly influence the mobility of elements including S , Fe , As , and Se , which exhibit multiple oxidation states .
Iron reduction can promote dissolution or transformation of Fe ( III ) ( oxy ) hydroxides and , therefore , has potential to impact metal ( loid ) mobility .
Acid generation associated with this process is neutralized in the presence of carbonate minerals to maintain circumneutral pH conditions .
Metals including Fe , Al , Zn , Cu , and Pb generally exhibit greater mobility under acidic pH conditions .
The mineralogical and geochemical composition of sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The mineralogical sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The mineralogical and geochemical composition sulfide mine wastes largely controls their potential for negative environmental impacts .
The fine - grained slurry is then introduced to aerated flotation cells where a frothing agent is added to promote bubble formation .
The sulfide - bearing froth is collected by decantation and residual slurry may undergo additional concentration .
The Greens Creek Mine is a NMD site and the Sherridon Mine is an AMD site .
These metals commonly occur in chalcopyrite [ CuFeS2 ] , pentlandite [ ( Fe , Ni ) 9S8 ] , sphalerite [ ( Zn , Fe ) S ] , and galena [ PbS ] ; however , gangue minerals including pyrite and pyrrhotite often dominate sulfide assemblages .
After ore minerals have been extracted and concentrated , the resulting tailings are commonly dewatered and deposited in sub - aerial tailings impoundments or stockpiles ( Blowes et al . , 2003 ) .
These tailings are generally characterized by elevated concentrations of weakly hydrolyzing metals including Fe ( II ) , Zn and Cd , and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Se , and Sb .
Under moderately acidic to circumneutral pH conditions , the mobility of several dissolved metal ( loid ) oxyanions including H2AsO4 - , SeO4 2 - and Sb ( OH ) 6 - is limited by sorption onto positively charged mineral surfaces .
Several metals including Fe , Al , Mn , Zn , Ni , Cu , and Pb may occur at high dissolved concentrations under AMD conditions .
Finally , pH - dependent sorption onto tailings solids can strongly influence the mobility of metals and trace elements released via sulfide - mineral oxidation .
Although AMD conditions exist at the Nickel Rim Mine , carbonate mineral dissolution sustains zones of circumneutral pH within the tailings deposit .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation ( redox ) , and sorption - desorption reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Subsequent precipitation - dissolution , reduction - oxidation ( redox ) , and sorption - desorption reactions control pore - water pH and the mobility of these weathering products .
Moreover , gypsum [ CaSO4·2H2O ] precipitation is often a principal control on dissolved SO4 2 - concentrations in carbonate - rich tailings deposits .
The extent of acid neutralization and , therefore , pore - water pH is a principal control on the mobility of sulfide - oxidation products within tailings deposits .
Production of H 2 S via microbial sulfate reduction may promote attenuation of sulfide - oxidation products , including Fe , Zn , Ni , and Tl , via metal - sulfide precipitation .
The resulting clay - to silt - sized particles are combined with water to form slurry and then treated with surfactants to render sulfide ore minerals hydrophobic .
The resulting oxidative weathering of sulfides can generate H + and release sulfate and metal ( loid ) s to tailings pore waters .
In contrast , neutral mine drainage ( NMD ) conditions generally persist in tailings deposits where carbonate dissolution effectively neutralizes acid generated by ongoing sulfide - mineral oxidation .
Production of H2S via sulfate reduction can promote precipitation of sparingly soluble metal - sulfide phases , whereas reduction of As ( V ) to As ( III ) typically enhances As mobility .
The resulting pH strongly influences concentrations and mobility of metal ( loid ) s released during sulfide mineral oxidation .
In contrast , weakly hydrolyzing metals ( e . g . , Fe ( II ) , Zn , Cd ) and ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements ( e . g . , As , Se , Sb ) tend to exhibit greater mobility under circumneutral pH conditions .
Consumption of carbonate minerals due to ongoing sulfide - mineral oxidation often precedes a transition to acidic pH conditions .
The oxidation of pyrite , pyrrhotite and other sulfide minerals releases SO 4 , Fe and associated metal ( loid ) s to tailings pore water .
Cemented layers of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide and ( hydroxy ) sulfate minerals , referred to as hardpans , may promote attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products within and below the oxidation zone .
The selectivity of froth flotation for specific sulfide minerals is dependent upon surfactant , slurry pH , and surface interactions with dissolved ions .
In contrast , ( hydr ) oxyanion - forming elements including As , Sb , Se , and Mo commonly exhibit greater mobility at circumneutral pH associated with neutral mine drainage ( NMD ) .
Hardpans may also limit oxygen ingress and pore - water migration within sulfide tailings deposits .
Case studies include the Greens Creek Mine ( Alaska , USA ) , Nickel Rim Mine ( Ontario , Canada ) and Sherritt - Gordon ( Sherridon ) Mine ( Manitoba , Canada ) ( Fig . 1 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
These elements may occur as discrete sulfides or as trace impurities in other ore and gangue sulfide minerals ( Plumlee , 1999 ) .
For example , common sources of As in sulfide ore deposits and associated mine wastes include arsenopyrite [ FeAsS ] and arsenian pyrite [ Fe ( AsxS ( 1 - x ) ) 2 ] .
Finally , a series of secondary redox reactions , including Fe ( II ) oxidation , Fe ( III ) reduction , and SO 4 reduction can strongly influence the mobility of metal ( loid ) s within tailings deposits .
The transport and attenuation of sulfide - mineral oxidation products are influenced by precipitation - dissolution , sorption - desorption , and redox reactions .
Despite their economic importance , sulfide minerals are also major sources of potentially toxic accessory elements including As , Se , Cd , Sb , and Hg .
Reductive dissolution or transformation of secondary ( oxy ) hydroxide phases can enhance Fe , Mn , and As mobility within sulfide tailings .

Detailed reviews on aspects of tailings dams ( Kossoff et al . , 2014 ) and methods for geochemical and mineralogical characterization of mine wastes ( Raudsepp and Pani , 2003 ; Weisener , 2003 ; Jamieson et al . , this issue ) have also been published during this time .
Research conducted at the Greens Creek , Nickel Rim , and Sherridon mines over the past 20 years has contributed to our understanding of the geochemical and mineralogical evolution of sulfide mine tailings .
Rather than providing an incremental update to the information provided in these publications , this review combines information derived from three detailed case studies with current literature to illustrate the processes and conditions that control sulfide - mineral oxidation and the subsequent mobility of associated reaction products within sulfide mine tailings .

Metasomatized mantle lithosphere or hydrous lower crustal cumulates residual from ﬁ rst - stage arc magmatism contain small amounts of chalcophile and siderophile element– rich sulﬁ des , and constitute a fertile source for hydrous , Au - rich , but relatively sulfur - poor magmas during later remelting .

Porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au and related epi thermal Au deposits are intrusion centered , and are formed at ≤4 and ≤1 km depth , respectively , by fl uids exsolved from magmas emplaced at ~ 5 - 10 km depth in the upper crust ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .

The majority of known deposits are genetically related to intermediate to felsic calcalkaline magmas in volcanoplutonic arcs above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1A ) .
Arc magmas are predominantly formed by partial melting of the metasomatized wedge of asthenospheric mantle between the downgoing oceanic and overriding oceanic or continental plates ( Ringwood , 1977 ) .

The cumulate residues from this process can be seen in exhumed lower crustal - upper mantle arc sections such as Talkeetna ( Alaska ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ) and Kohistan ( Pakistan ; Jagoutz et al . , 2007 ) .
These cumulates contain large amounts of amphibole along with olivine , pyroxene , and plagioclase , and garnet in thicker arc sections .
Magmas processed through these lower crustal MASH zones commonly display relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the suppression of early plagioclase crystallization and the preferential partitioning of Y and middle and heavy rare earth elements into amphibole and garnet ( Green and Pearson , 1985 ) .

Magma generation beneath an arc may cease for several reasons , including migration of the locus of melting due to changes in the angle of subduction ( e . g . , North and South American Cordillera ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) , subduction reversal or jumping ( e . g . , southwest Pacifi c ; Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , or collision that terminates subduction ( e . g . , Papua New Guinea and southwest Asia ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Richards et al . , 1990 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ) .
Translithospheric extensional structures provide channelways for rapid ascent of mantlederived magmas to upper crustal levels , with little crustal interaction ( Richards et al . , 1990 ) .

Arc magmatism leaves a large amount of hydrous residue at the base of the crust and in the lithospheric mantle ( Fig . 1A ) , which , due to the high magmatic sulfur content ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , likely also contains some residual sulfi de phases .
Arc magmas , although sulfur rich , are also relatively oxidized , such that the bulk of the sulfur is present as SO 2 dissolved in the magma ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Chalcophile and siderophile elements such as Cu , Ni , Au , and PGE partition strongly into sulfi de phases relative to silicate melts , with partition coefficients increasing from Cu < Ni < Au and PGE ( Peach et al . , 1990 ) .

These magmas originate by partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
These basaltic magmas evolve and interact with the upper plate litho sphere as they ascend to form hybrid andesitic magmas characterized by relatively high oxidation states ( typically ~ 2 log f O2 units higher than the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer ) and high water contents ( ≥4 wt % H 2 O ) ( as reviewed in Richards , 2003 ) .
Thus , postsubduction magmatism tends to be spatially isolated , and mildly ( high - K ± Na calcalkaline ) to strongly alkaline in character .

Although magmas with these characteristics most commonly form directly in response to inputs from the subduction zone , it is also possible to extract compositionally and isotopically similar magmas from upper plate lithosphere that has been modifi ed by prior subduction processes , but with melting caused by later postsubduction events ( e . g . , Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ) .

In mature island arcs or continental arcs , primitive basaltic magmas ascending from the mantle wedge typically stall at the base of the upper plate crust due to density contrasts ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ) .
However , the lack of active subduction and their crustal isotopic compositions preclude a slab - melting origin ( Hou et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2005 ) .
Associated magmas tend to be mildly alkaline , relatively sul - fur poor , and emplaced as isolated complexes rather than in voluminous volcanoplutonic arcs .
In contrast , postsubduction arc contraction caused by collision may lead to crustal thickening and delamination of the SCLM , with partial melting occurring in depressed lower crustal rocks as isotherms rebound or hot asthenospheric melts invade ( Figs . 1B and 1C ) .
The resulting magmas are more felsic , commonly with calcalkaline to mildly alkaline character , and have crustal radiogenic isotopic signatures ( Harris et al . , 1986 ; Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ) .
Accordingly , arc magmas are commonly associated with high - sulfi dation - style epithermal deposits , whereas postsubduction systems are more typically low sulfi dation .
In the case of postsubduction arc extension , decompression melting may occur in upwelling subduction - metasomatized asthenosphere and / or attenuated lithosphere , leading to the generation of mafi c alkaline ( shoshonitic or hawaiitic ) magmas ( Fig . 1D ; Luhr , 1997 ; Paquette et al . , 2003 ) .
The presence of amphibole and / or garnet in the lower crustal former arc source rocks may accentuate the high Sr / Y and La / Yb signatures of these magmas , leading to their ( mis - ) identifi cation as adakites in some cases .

If this fertile , hydrous residue is subjected to a second stage of melting , either by invasion of small volumes of hot , oxidized asthenospheric magma , or thermal rebound after lithospheric thickening ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) , then Au - rich residual sulfide phases may redissolve ( R ≥ 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) to generate magmas with relatively high Au / Cu ratios ( Solomon , 1990 ; Richards , 2005 ) and perhaps also PGE enrichments ( cf .

It is proposed that these deposits were formed from hydrous magmas derived by partial remelting of the metasomatized lithospheric roots and hydrous cumulate zones of former arc systems , in response to a variety of mechanisms such as lithospheric thickening and thermal rebound , subcontinental lithospheric mantle ( SCLM ) delamination , or lithospheric extension ( Figs . 1B - 1D ) .

During second - stage postsubduction mag - matism , these small volumes of sulﬁ de will remelt , releasing their metal contents to the alkaline silicate magma .

Examples include : the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in eastern central Turkey , which postdates Cretaceous - Paleocene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ) ; the late Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwest Iran , which postdates Paleogene - early Neogene Neo - Tethyan collision ( Richards et al . , 2006 ) ; Neogene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the southwest Pacifi c , which followed collision or subduction reversal ( Solomon , 1990 ) ; and mid - Miocene porphyry Cu - Au deposits in Tibet , which postdate Late Cretaceous collision between India and Asia ( Hou et al . , 2005 ) .
They are likely formed by remelting of previously subduction - modiﬁ ed arc lithosphere , trig - gered by postsubduction lithospheric thickening , lithospheric extension , or mantle lithosphere delamination .
Where moderate amounts of sulfi de are present relative to the volume of silicate melt ( R = 10 2 - 10 5 ; Fig . 2 ) , the concentration of Cu in the magma will be minimally affected because of its greater overall abundance ( tens to hundreds of parts per million ) and lower partition coeffi cient ( D ≈10 3 ) , whereas sparse ( parts per million to parts per billion ) Au , Ni , and other highly siderophile elements ( D ≥ 10 5 ) will be depleted in the magma ( Fig . 2 ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) .
All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .

All of these systems formed in extensional or transtensional structural settings after subduction either ceased ( Lihir , Porgera ) or migrated away ( Emperor , Cripple Creek ) .
Nevertheless , small amounts of sulfi de ( as melt or crystalline phases ) can be expected to be present , which because of its high density will tend to settle out in cumulate zones .
In contrast , the complementary residual sulfi des will be enriched in these highly siderophile elements .
Because of their sparsity ( under the relatively oxidizing but S - rich conditions of arc mag - matism ) , these sulﬁ de phases will be enriched in Au and other highly siderophile elements .

Depending on the cause , the former arc may undergo stress states ranging from tension ( rifting ) to compression ( collision ) .
A corollary of this process is that postsubduction magmas and associated hydrothermal ore deposits will be less sulfur rich than fi rst - stage arc systems .
Late - stage partition - ing of these metals into hydrothermal ﬂ uids exsolved during cooling and crystallization of this magma at upper crustal levels generates magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits superﬁ - cially similar to arc - related porphyry and epi - thermal deposits , but more enriched in Au and of generally lower sulﬁ dation state .

Both states may lead to a brief resurgence in magmatism ( Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ; Paquette et al . , 2003 ) .
Davidson et al . ( 2007 ) proposed that these amphibole - rich cumulates act like a sponge , storing as much as 20 % of the water in the original arc magma fl ux .
) , with essentially instantaneous cessation of arc volcanism ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ) .
The most characteristic mineralization style in extensional postsubduction environments is alkalic - type epithermal Au , associated with mafi c alkalic intrusive complexes ( Richards , 1995 ) .
They are thus directly linked to the petrogenesis of arc magmas , and derive their fundamental characteristics ( e . g . , relatively high oxidation state and enrichments in alkalies , S , Cl , H 2 O , and some metals ) from subduction processes .
These two characteristics are critical to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits ( Candela , 1992 ) : the high oxidation state suppresses the formation of signifi cant amounts of magmatic sulfi de phases , which would strip the magma of chalcophile and siderophile metals ( e . g . , Fe , Cu , Au , Mo ; Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 2005 ) ; and the high water content results in saturation of the magma in an aqueous fl uid phase upon ascent into the upper crust , into which these metals will effi ciently partition ( Candela and Holland , 1984 ) .
These broad similarities , but also subtle differences , in both magma composition and ore deposit style suggest similar petrogenetic and metallogenic processes , differing only in detail .
However , because of the transience of these events ( compared with steady - state subduction ) , the magmas will be formed in relatively small volumes and at relatively low degrees of partial melting ( Davies and von Blankenburg , 1995 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) .
However , there is increasing evidence for the existence of a suite of porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits related to magmas generated after subduc - tion beneath the arc has ceased .

In both cases ( extension or contraction ) , the source region is previously subduction - modifi ed lithosphere ± asthenosphere , and the postsubduction magmas therefore share many of the geo chemical and isotopic characteristics of the pre ceding arc magmatism .

In a process described by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) as melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) , heat released from this mafi c magma input causes partial melting of crustal rocks .

High fO2 would increase sulfur solubility in the magma , thus prohibiting early removal of metals via sulfide precipitation .
Porphyry Cu ( - Mo - Au ) deposits are mainly formed in subduction - related magmatic arcs ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1972Sillitoe , , 2010Richards , 2003 ) , yet it is still unclear why some magmatic arcs ( or sections of a magmatic arc ) are more Cu - endowed ( e . g . , Andes ; Sillitoe , 2012 ) .
Zircons from In summary , the duration of the Pulang complex may last only several millions Pulang complex . 2006 ; Pang et al . , 2009 ) .
High fO2 can significantly increase sulfur solubility in magmas ( e . g . , Jugo et al . , 2005 ; Jugo , 2009 ; Hou and Zhang , 2015 ) , and thus prohibit early sulfide saturation ( e . g . , Sun et al . , 2015 , 2017 ) .

The Late Triassic Pulang intrusive complex comprises five phase of porphyrtic stocks and dikes ( ca .
The oxidized nature of the parental magmas at Pulang indicates that sulfides may not have saturated during the magma emplacement , so that the PGE contents in the silicate melts remain unchanged .
The sulfide - unsaturated magma would dissolve sulfides , if any , in the crust and elevate its PGE contents due to extremely high PGE budget in such sulfides .

( 4 ) High oxygen fugacity and high water contents were two critical ore - forming 20 critical ore - forming factors for the Pulang porphyry Cu - Au deposit .

Thus , the whole - rock trace elements and zircon Hf - O isotopes do not support a common magmatic source between the intrusive and The Pulang complex is mainly andesitic to dacitic , broadly lying on the fractional crystallization trends defined by the lavas ( Fig . 10a - f ) .

Although the Pulang intrusive complex and the volcanic wall rocks contain slightly varying PGE concentrations ( Table 3 ) , all the rocks do not show PGE enrichments relative to OIB ( Fig . 12 ) .
Thus , both high oxygen fugacity and water contents are ( 2 ) The Pulang complex was likely formed in a long - lived ( ~ 5 m . y . )

Consequently , large amounts of Cu - rich sulfides accumulated there may have been remobilized and contributed to later porphyry - related metallogenic event ( s ) ( e . g . , Hou et al . , 2017 ) .
The consistent zircon Hf - O isotopes , together with the deficiency of inherited zircons in the Pulang complex ( Fig . 4 ) , suggest that crustal assimilation was likely minimal .
Although these magmas were oxidized , which is favorable for ore metal transport , they may have different physicochemical properties as indicated by the varying amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) .
( 1 ) Both the Pulang complex and the mafic - intermediate volcanic wall rocks have similar PGE abundances and mantle - normalized PGE patterns , implying that no appreciable sulfide cumulates were lost or gained during the magma fractionation in the upper crust .
We suggest that oxygen fugacity and H2O content of the magma are two critical factors that controlled the Pulang porphyry Cu - Au metallogeny .
Meanwhile , the melts equilibrated with the low - Al amphibole were likely more oxidized ( NNO + 1 . 0 – NNO + 1 . 7 ) but with lower H2O content ( 4 . 2– 4 . 9 wt . % ) .
In this study , the most mafic rocks ( i . e . , alkaline basalt ) contain high PPGE concentrations ( Pd = 5 . 9 ppb , Pt = 5 . 4 ppb ) , comparable to those of the typical arc basalts ( e . g . , basalts from the Tonga Rear Arc ; Park et al . , 2015 ) , and higher than 18 those of basalts from the Cameroon Line suite , which were suggested to have formed from low - degree ( < 8 % ) partial melting of mantle peridotite ( Rehkämper et al . , 1999 ) .
The variation in PGE concentrations between different types of rocks at Pulang is probably ascribed to magma mixing between mafic and felsic end - members .
16 The covariant εHf ( t ) vs . δ18O zircon arrays of the analyzed rocks exhibit a negative linear relationship ( Fig . 13 ) , implying a trend of magma mixing between two end - members ( e . g . , Kemp et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
In contrast , the magma that equilibrated with the low - Al amphibole was likely formed at a much shallower depth ( 89 – 202 MPa , ca .
In addition , the higher H2O content may have enhanced volatile exsolution from the 2 evolving magmas at Pulang .
In addition , the volcanic rocks have more positive εHf ( t ) ( 3 . 7 ± 0 . 3 ) and mantle - like δ18O signatures ( 5 . 8 ‰ ) than those of the intrusive rocks ( εHf ( t ) = - 0 . 8 – 0 . 1 ; δ18O ratios < 6 . 4 ‰ ) , indicative of different origins .
Furthermore , the PGE variations in the studied rocks can also be explained by the mixing of two melt end - members .
Nonetheless , the IPGE depletions could also be led by the presence of certain IPGE - rich phases ( e . g . , alloy , Cr spinel and chromite ; Barnes and Lightfoot , 2005 ) in the melt residue .
Therefore , either high - degree ( > 18 – 25 % ) of partial melting , or moderate - degree of melting ( > 11 % ) of an oxidized source ( where sulfide phases are unstable ) , can significantly increase the PGE concentrations in the magmas ( Arndt et al . , 2005 , and references therein ) .
We propose that the Pulang magma did not undergo early sulfide removal , and that the magma was likely sulfide - unsaturated during its emplacement .
Thus , the relatively low PGE contents of the Pulang magmatic rocks preclude the existence of early Cu - rich sulfide accumulation at depth .
At Pulang , most of the volcanic rocks have consistent Pd / Pt ratios of ~ 1 ( Fig . 12 ; Table 3 ) , indicating that the lavas may not have fractionated Pt - alloys or sulfides .
It is estimated that the magma equilibrated with the high - Al amphibole may have contained up to 6 . 2 wt . % H2O , and was formed under 334 – 538 MPa ( ca .
This is because PGE , as highly - chalcophile elements , have D sulfide liquid / silicate melt ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
geochemistry of the giant Pulang porphyry Cu - Au system in the Sanjiang Region , SW China .
It has been suggested that compressive arc settings , notably those led by aseismic ridge or flat - slab subduction , are favorable for producing large and high - grade porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1988 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Tosdal et al . , 2009 ) .
5 . 2 Genetic link between porphyries and volcanic rocks at Pulang Porphyry stocks , as by - products of subduction - related magmas , are commonly emplaced in a subvolcanic environment covered by a volcanic edifice of pyroclastic rocks and / or lava flows ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1973 , 2010 ) , which is also documented at 15 plutons ( mostly intermediate in composition ) .
They were likely formed at shallower depths ( 3 – 7 km ) at low temperatures ( 770 – 810 ℃ ) .
Therefore , the importance of early accumulation of Cu - rich sulfides in later porphyry mineralization remains unclear .
Therefore , we propose that the parental magmas of the Pulang complex may have formed by mixing of two magmas , as supported by the wide variation range of plagioclase phenocryst ( An6 – An60 ; Fig . 7 ) and amphibole ( Fig . 9 ) compositions .
5 . 1 Timing and duration of the Pulang intrusive activity At Pulang , the pre - mineralized QDP has zircon U - Pb ages of ca .
216 – 217 Ma and titanium - in - zircon temperatures of 685 – 706℃ , indistinguishable from those of the syn - mineralized MP and QMP ( 215 . 9 Ma and 695 ± 20℃ , and 215 . 1 – 217 . 1 Ma and 676 – 698 ℃ , respectively ) ( Table 1 ; Fig . 5 ) .
They are slightly older than the potassic alteration and the related mineralization ( ca .
This is because PGE are extremely chalcophile , and are predominantly hosted by sulfide and / or alloy phases in the mantle .
Furthermore , as reflected by the low - Al amphibole compositions ( Fig . 14 ) , the inferred H2Omelt content decreased ( < 4 . 9 wt . % ) with increasing oxygen fugacity ( > NNO + 1 . 0 ) .
This may have occurred during the onset of volatile exsolution at shallow depths , and represents another factor that promoted ore formation ( Cline , 2003 ) .
However , the genetic link between the intrusive and extrusive rocks is not always clear .
To summarize , this study confirms that magma mixing is a plausible mechanism to produce the PGE variation observed at Pulang .
Many recent studies , based largely on the platinum - group elements ( PGE ) geochemistry , were conducted to elucidate the sulfide saturation history in porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Gao et al . , 2015 ; Park et al . , 2015 ; Cocker et al . , 2016 ; Hao et al . , 2017 ) .
Sun et al . ( 2017 ) also suggested that such Cu pre - enrichment through sulfide saturation is not a prerequisite for generating large porphyry Cu deposits .
Therefore , IPGE - depleted signatures of the Pulang intrusive and extrusive rocks suggest that the parental magmas may have formed by low - degree ( < 11 % ) partial melting of a PGE - depleted mantle source .
Our petrological modeling demonstrates that most zircons from the Pulang complex crystallized from a melt containing up to 40 – 50 % crustal materials , and around 10 – 20 % for the volcanic lavas ( Fig . 13 ) .
The results show that the magmas equilibrated with the high - Al amphibole may have contained 4 . 8 – 6 . 2 wt . % H2O , and formed at a depth of 11 – 18 km at 858 – 935 ℃ , and an oxygen fugacity of NNO + 0 . 2 – NNO + 1 . 5 ( Fig . 14 ) .
A similar conclusion has also been reached in the study on the Kelian Au deposit ( Setiabudi et al . , 2007 ) , implying that magma mixing may have been a common yet often underestimated phenomenon .
On the other hand , the geometry ( i . e . , curvature ) of the εHf ( t ) vs . δ18O arrays can be used to constraint the relative Hf isotope compositions of the end - members ( e . g . , Kemp et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) .
The model predicted that approximately 2 / 3 of the Cu budget of primary arc magmas is possibly stripped by sulfides near the lithospheric mantle - crust boundary .
Three models have been proposed to interpret this linkage : ( 1 ) fractional crystallization from a common parental magma ( e . g . , Sisson and Grove , 1993 ; Sisson et al . , 2005 ; Feig et al . , 2006 ; Ulmer , 2007 ) , ( 2 ) mixing and hybridization of two end - member melts ( e . g . , Groves et al . , 2005 ; Reubi and Blundy , 2009 ) , and ( 3 ) the melt expulsion model ( especially for rhyolite , Bachmann and Bergantz , 2004 ; Bachmann et al . , 2007 ; Bachmann and Huber 2016 ) , in which the volcanic rocks are regarded as erupted melt - rich regions , while the crystal mush crystallized to form the depleted in incompatible and compatible elements ( Fig . 10e , f ) .
As shown in Figure 13 , the two end - members are expected to have similar Hf concentrations , which are substantiated by previous studies ( He et al . , 2013 ; Leng et al . , 2014 ) .
To test this model and explore the possible controlling factors of porphyry Cu metallogeny , we studied the mineralogy and platinum - group element ( PGE ) sulfide cumulates were lost or gained during magmatic differentiation .
This , however , does not support a co - magmatic origin , because no enrichments in incompatible elements were found in the volcanic rocks over the intrusive rocks , and both rock types are mafic than the intrusive rocks ( Fig . 10 ) , precluding the third model .
5 . 5 Ore - forming controls of the Pulang Cu - Au deposit This study concludes that both the intrusive and extrusive rocks at Pulang have not experienced early sulfide removal or addition , and thus the parental magmas were 19 likely sulfide - unsaturated prior to their emplacement .
However , this hypothesis was challenged by Richards ( 2015 ) , who argued that the volume of sulfide accumulations is too small to significantly affect the Cu budget of primary arc magmas .
If the sample DSG11 - 15 ( with the lowest SiO2 and the highest PGE contents ) is taken as the mafic end - member and the Upper Continental Crust ( Rudnick and Gao , 2014 ) as the felsic end - member , most of the PGE data of the Pulang intrusive and extrusive rocks can be reproduced by mixing between the two end - members with various ratios ( not shown ) .
5 . 4 Removal and accumulation of sulfides during magma emplacement Previous studies demonstrated that the PGE abundance in primary basaltic magmas are controlled largely by the degree of partial melting and the oxidization state of the mantle peridotite ( Keays , 1995 ; Arndt et al . , 2005 ; Naldrett , 2010 ; Gao et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) .
Although these two amphibole types contain different water contents ( Fig . 14c ) , both were crystallized from oxidized magmas ( > NNO + 0 . 2 ) , as also supported by the large amount of magnetite observed .
Some studies also argued that the reason for this heterogeneity of Cu endowment may lie deeper in the crust , e . g . , a recent model proposed that high Cu endowment in some magmatic arcs may have led by the accumulation of cupriferous sulfides at the base of continental arcs ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2012 ; Chiaradia , 2013 ; Hou et al . , 2017 ) .
The QMP has a gradational contact with the QDP , suggesting that the QDP and QMP ( possibly also MP ) were formed in a these two slightly younger dikes yielded an elevated titanium - in - zircon temperature ( ~ 730 ℃ ; Fig . 5 ) , indicating that the late dike emplacements were likely triggered by brief injection of hotter magmas , which promoted the incremental growth of the of years , rather than tens of million years as previously considered ( e . g . , Zeng et al . , short timespan that cannot be distinguished by LA - ICP - MS dating method .

Hydrothermal mineralization can cause enrichment or depletion of elements in ore bodies and surrounding country rocks .
Local metal enriched rocks can become an ore body that can be mined at an economic profit .
The multifractal distributions of concentration of chemical elements on the surface of pyrite crystals selected from veins of different types were investigated using digital images generated by means of ESEM .
Vein types at Tongchang ore body and their alteration and mineralization characteristics .
The early K - feldspar alteration and related A - type veins is observed only in few places on small scale .
The chlorite + illite alteration is transitional and characterized by B - type veins .
Late alteration and mineralization are characterized muscovite + quartz alteration and is related to D - type veins .
A range of trace elements , including Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti were analyzed on the surface of pyrite crystals using ESEM .
This apparent multifractal behavior reveal that the spatial variability of studied element concentrations on surface of pyrite crystals from different veins and veinlets can be successfully correlated with the vein types and related alteration and mineralization zone delineated using other customized geological methods .
The α and f ( α ) values of the singularity spectrum were computed with Eq .
The spatial distribution of ore - forming elements at different scales is of primary importance for ore exploration , and researches in recent decades have demonstrated that similarity exists at different scales , or non - scale distribution , which can be investigated by fractal / multifractal theory .
The Cu concentration in D - type vein pyrite is higher than that in pyrite from other veins and veinlets .
For pyrite from the same mineralization stage , different samples show more or less different trace element distributions and even a single pyrite crystal may contain different levels of trace elements .
The multifractal analysis of elemental micro - distributions on scale of pyrite crystal surfaces were employed to allow quantitative insights into the geometrical organization of these elements .
The elemental spectra differ , probably as a consequence of different genetic and intrinsic processes , which are part of the general scenario for ore - forming events on hydrothermal vein systems .
Also , geometrical properties and scale - independent characteristics of anomalies were considered in fractal / multifractal methods ( Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Cheng and Agterberg , 1996 ) .
Several multifractal parameters were calculated , however , the most significant ones are ∆α and ∆αL .
Most applications of fractal theory use the monofractal - approach , which assumes that the spatial distribution of an element or other property of an object can be characterized by a single fractal dimension .
Generally , all of the pyrite contains variable concentrations of Cu and other elements .
To 1 achieve our goal , the distribution patterns of element concentration values of eight elements ( Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si and Ti ) on the pyrite surface selected from B - type , D - type and H - type veins and veinlets were represented by multifractal spectra .
We note , however , that fractured parts of the crystals often contain higher levels of trace elements .
The local variability of hydrothermal mineralization can result in element concentration enrichment or depletion , and locally metal enriched rocks can become mineable ore bodies .
To achieve this objective , the distribution of Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , P , S , Si , and Ti on the surfaces of pyrite crystals were analyzed using the mapping capabilities of ESEM .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of elements caused by mineralization is crucial for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
Therefore , understanding the spatial distribution of element concentration enrichment or depletion caused by hydrothermal mineralization is of great importance for mineral exploration and resource assessment .
The results indicate that the element concentration pattern in D - type veins and related alteration and mineralization is highly dispersed and , therefore , most favorable for Cu ore - concentration .
Due to the stochastic nature of geochemical data , it is generally difficult to find and assess the distribution types of geochemical elements which reflect the underlying mineralization processes .
Furthermore , a parameter called asymmetry index ( Rα ) of multifractal spectrum curve , can effectively provide information about the ore - forming potential assessment .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
It is destroyed and overprinted by later alteration and mineralization .
The non - symmetric shapes suggest singular behavior of element distribution , because they are not reduced to a single spike .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for oreforming processes .
A higher ∆α value indicates that the concentration of an element is more variable and enriched , providing a favorable conditions for ore - forming processes .
This does not only contribute to obtain a full spectrum of element distributions at different scales , but should also provide a new way to characterize different vein types .
The objective of this study is to identify different vein types by means of detailed field , microscopic , X - Ray Diffraction ( XRD ) and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy ( ESEM ) examinations , to reveal the micro - distribution of elements on the crystal surfaces of pyrites found in veins of different types .
Other important methods include analysis of frequency distributions and spatial correlation of element concentration values .
These parameters are found to be higher in the D - type veins related to late phyllic alteration and mineralization in comparison with other veins and vein systems , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are highly enriched in D - type veins .
All spatial distribution measures of the eight elements investigated clearly show multifractal scaling behavior .
Carlson , 1991 ) , but little has been done on the concentration micro - distribution of elements at the crystal surfaces of major ore minerals ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Reich et al . , 2013 ) .
The objectives of this work were firstly to identify different vein types , and secondly to evaluate the potential of multifractal parameters , constructed using the so - called method of moments , to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of concentration of elements on mineral surfaces which may provide insight into hydrothermal mineralization and its effect on spatial and temporal distribution of element concentration .
The rock samples were collected at different localities from veins within hydrothermal systems of the Dexing porphyry copper deposit ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
Based on the analytical results and previous investigations , the vein systems within the deposit can be divided into four main types as follows : ( 1 ) early quartz veins ( A - type veins ) related to K - feldspar alteration ; ( 2 ) quartz - pyrite - molybdenite - chalcopyrite veins ( B - type veins ) related to chlorite + illite alteration ; ( 3 ) quartz - pyrite - chalcopyrite veins ( D - type veins ) related to late phyllic ( muscovite + quartz ) alteration ; and ( 4 ) the latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ( H - type veins ) .
The latest 11 alteration and mineralization stage is characterized by carbonate - sulphate - oxide alteration and associated with H - type veins ( Figure 4 and Table 1 ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body .
Based on the analytical results and other previous investigations , the vein systems were divided into four main vein types and associated alteration and mineralization stages .
The ∆α and ∆αL values for the elements ( Cu , Fe and S ) are higher in the D - type veins ( related 13 to late phyllic alteration zone ) as compared to B - type ( related to transitional chlorite + illite alteration ) and H - type veins ( related to latest carbonate - sulphate - oxide veins ) ( Table 2 and Figure 10 ) which show only slight fluctuations in these parameters , indicating that the ore minerals containing Cu and Fe sulphides are strongly enriched in D - type veins and associated alteration and mineralization .
In recent years , fractal and multifractal techniques have been extensively used to describe spatial structures in geochemical data for mineral exploration ( Xuejing and Binchuan , 1993 ; Xie and Bao , 2004b ; Xie et al . , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2010a ; Xie et al . , 2010b ; Arias et al . , 2012 ; Heidari et al . , 2013 ) .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different veins within the Tongchang ore body of the Dexing porphyry Cu - Mo Deposit .
Therefore , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising to discriminate between mineralized veins developed during different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body .
This multifractal procedure has been used to characterize variability of many natural phenomena , including characteristics of mineralization and mineral deposits ( Carlson , 1991 ; Cheng et al . , 1994 ; Sanderson et al . , 1994 ; Agterberg , 1995 ; Turcotte , 1997 , 2002 ; Gumiel et al . , 2010 ; Arias et al . , 2011 ) .
Hence , in this study , the multifractal parameters , particularly , ∆α and ∆αL appear to be promising parameters to discriminate between mineralized veins developed at different stages of hydrothermal activity which led to development of the porphyry system at Tongchang ore body of the Dexing Porphyry copper Deposit .
This is consistent with field observations , chemical and petrographic analysis and previous investigations by other authors including Mao et al . ( 2011 ) , showing that the D - type veins are the most important for the mineralization in the Dexing porphyry deposit .
Elements from different samples collected from different veins and veinlets within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
In this study a total of 24 representative samples were collected from different within the deposits may differ to some extent in their multifractal parameters ; this suggests that the element distribution patterns are controlled to a large degree by the conditions under which the host mineral was formed .
These differences in the aperture of multifractal spectrum suggest a wide range of differences in the overall variability and in the heterogeneity of the studied element distributions which provide direct information on element behavior during crystallization and related differentiation processes .

Porphyry Cu deposits are typically developed in oceanic slab subduction - related magmatic arcs ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Sillitoe , 1972 , 2010 ) , and are genetically related to partial melting of the subduction - metasomatized asthenosphere mantle wedge ( Richards , 2003 , 2011 ) .

Fluid exsolution in the magma chamber The early - stage amphibole phenocrysts from Yulong have higher crystallization Journal Pre - proof pressures and temperatures than the late - stage amphibole grains , suggesting that they crystalized at deeper depth before the crystallization of low - Al amphiboles ( Fig . 12B ) .

Textural and compositional variations of silicate mineral phenocrysts ( amphibole , plagioclase ) suggest that the magma chamber beneath Yulong ( 7 . 1–12 . 5 km in depth ) might have been recharged by a mafic magma , and was saturated in magmatic fluids at the time of emplacement of the Yulong intrusion ( 4 . 0–5 . 6 km in depth ) .
The periodic changes in magma compositions are most possibly resulted from pulsed recharge of the magma chamber by a less evolved magma ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Andrews et al . , 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .

The An contents vary periodically or conversely from plagioclase cores to rims , and are coupled by FeO contents ( Fig . 13A - C ) .
The magmatic oxidation states are high , and increase during magma evolution , which may have been essential to the enrichment of metals in the evolving magma .
The oxidation states are relatively high ( ΔNNO > 0 . 6 ) , and increase through magma evolution .

These high δ18O values are typical of supracrustal input ( Cavosie et al . , 2005 ; Hawkesworth and Kemp , 2006 ; Kemp et al . , 2006 ) .
Although partial melting of sources of these alkalic - rich igneous rocks has been attributed to asthenospheric upwelling ( e . g . , Zhang and Xie , 1997 ) , the cause of asthenospheric upwelling remains controversial . Several models have been 22 / 58 suggested that efficient hybridization between mafic and felsic magmas could only happen under the conditions of high temperature and intense magma convection in depth ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) .

The giant Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit , located in eastern Tibet ( Fig . 1A ) , is a typical postsubduction porphyry Cu - Mo deposit ( Tang and Luo , 1995 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ) .

Caculated crystallization depths indicate that the early - stage amphibole may have crystallized in the underlying magma chamber ( 7 . 1–12 . 5 km ) , whereas the low - Al amphibole has crystallized in the porphyry stock ( 4 . 0–5 . 6 km ) .
Key words : Yulong porphyry Cu - Mo deposit ; Sr - Nd - Hf - O isotopes ; origin ; fluid exsolution 1 .
The elevated oxygen fugacity will suppress early formation of Cu - rich sulfides , and thus will be favorable for metal transportation and enrichment during magma evolution and emplacement ( Mungall , 2002 ; Jugo et al . , 2005 ; Richards , 2015 ) .
Origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains a matter of debate .
Origin of the Yulong intrusion are classified as oligoclase ( An10 - 20 ) to andesine ( An40 - 50 ) .
However , the high whole - rock SiO2 ( 66 . 3–69 . 5 wt % ) and low MgO ( < 1 . 24 % ) contents and Mg # values ( < 46 ) argue against its origin by direct partial melting of the lithosphere mantle ( Baker , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) .
The relatively high oxidation states allow the metals to be enriched in the evolving magma , and to be deposited in the hydrothermal alteration stage .
Although a few inherited zircons have been found in the Yulong intrusion ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , the relatively uniform zircon Hf - O and apatite Sr - Nd isotopes ( Figs . 8 and 9 ) probably indicate that crustal contamination is insignificant during emplacement of Yulong .
It has been The Yulong intrusion has broadly similar zircon U - Pb ages ( ~ 41 . 0 Ma ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Huang et al . , 2019b ) and geochemical features with the alkaline felsic magmatic rocks along the strike - slip faults in eastern Tibet and western Yunnan ( i . e .
Therefore , the partial melting of ancient - and juvenile crustal components at Yulong was probably triggered by crustal scale extension and upwelling of the asthenosphere along the strike - slip faults in eastern Tibet ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ) , caused by India - Asia collision at about 65–55Ma ( Fig . 14A–B ; Chung et al . , 1997 ; Leech et al . , 2005 ; Mo et al . , 2007 ; Journal Pre - proof Hu et al . , 2015b ) .
To the west , the north Qiangtang terrane is separated from south Qiangtang terrane by the Permian - Triassic Zuogong - Jinghong arc ( Fig . 1B ) .
Furthermore , the late - stage amphiboles have higher magmatic oxygen fugacities ( e . g . , ΔNNO values ) than the early - stage amphiboles ( Fig . 12D ) .
Despite a mass of whole rock geochemical and zircon Hf isotopic studies , origin of the ore - related Yulong intrusion remains controversial . Major disputes include partial melting of the ancient subduction - metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Hou et al . , 2003 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or the juvenile mafic arc lower crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) .
Furthermore , the Yulong intrusion has mainly elevated zircon δ18O values of 6 . 4 to 7 . 6‰ ( Figs . 8D and 9A ; average = 7 . 0 ± 0 . 5‰ , 2σ , n = 79 ) .
This study presents new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes , and mineralogical chemistry of the Yulong intrusion .
Replenishment in the magma chamber Plagioclase phenocrysts from Yulong show large variation of An contents of up to 25 mol % ( Fig . 13A - C ; Appendix Table A5 ) .
They have less evolved Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 9B ) , but remarkably higher REE and LILEs contents than the Yulong intrusion ( Fig . 7A - B ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal 3 / 58 precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
In addition , voluminous fluid exsolution and focused metal precipitation are also essential factors in producing high grade mineralization ( Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
This indicates that the Yulong intrusion should not have Journal Pre - proof originated from the lithospheric mantle , but most likely from the juvenile mafic lower crust .
It is separated from the Songpan - Ganze terrane by the Permian Jiangda - Weixi arc , which is product of the subduction of the Jinshajiang Ocean ( a branch of the Paleo - Tethys ocean ) during Permian - Triassic ( Fig . 1B ; Hou et al . , 2003 ; Zi et al . , 2012a ) .
This suggests that these mafic lavas are unlikely to have been the parental magma of the Yulong intrusion , because fractional crystallization of a mafic magma generally produce felsic magmas with higher REE and LILEs contents ( e . g . , Rollinson , 1993 ) .
This , together with the deficiency of covariant between zircon εHf ( t ) and δ18O values ( Fig . 7A ) and homogeneous Sr - Nd isotopes ( Fig . 7B ) , indicates that the mixing of ancient - and juvenile crustal components was most likely Journal Pre - proof to have happened in the deep crust by concurrent partial melting .

This probably indicates a heterogeneous source of the Yulong intrusion , consisting mainly of a juvenile mafic lower crust with positive εHf ( t ) values and an ancient crustal component with negative εHf ( t ) values and high δ18O values .

This probably indicates a heterogeneous source of the Yulong intrusion , consisting mainly of a juvenile mafic lower crust with positive εHf ( t ) values and an ancient crustal component high δ18O values .
This is possibly caused by late - stage fractionation or fluid exsolution process , 24 / 58 Journal Pre - proof as the caculated fO2 values are negatively correlated with water contents ( Fig . 12D ) .
The depleted source of the Yulong intrusion is probably a juvenile mafic lower arc crust , as suggested by the arc - like trace element patterns ( Fig . 7A - B ) and positive zircon Hf isotopes and young Hf mantle model ages ( Figs . 8C , and 10 ) .
They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements ( LILEs ) and depletion in high field strength elements ( HFSEs ) , and show listric REE patterns .
Origin of these ore - forming porphyries , however , remains a matter of debate .
Considering the fact that the Cenozoic alkaline magmatic rocks ( including the Yulong intrusion ) are distributed strictly along the NW - SE strike - slip faults , we prefer the later model that asthenospheric upwelling was induced by regional decompression caused by strike - slip faults .
It has been suggested that the Yulong intrusion originated directly from low - degree partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) , or formed by assimilation - fractional crystallization ( AFC ) of 19 / 58 Journal Pre - proof metasomatized mantle - derived melts ( Hou et al . , 2003 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .

Caculated water contents of the magma parental to the late - stage amphibole are lower than those of the early - stage amphibole , which may suggest fluid exsolution from the underlying magma chamber at the time of emplacement of the Yulong stock ( Fig . 12C ; Leng et al . , 2018 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) .
These large - scale ( 100μm ~ ) An and FeO variations are unlikely to have been caused by simple changes in magma pressure / temperatures or by chemical diffusion ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Ustunisik et al . , 2014 ; Waters and Lange , 2015 ) , but probably reflect periodic changes in magma compositions ( Singer et al . , 1995 ; Andrews et al . , 23 / 58 Journal Pre - proof 2008 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) .
It is also noteworthy that a few magmatic zircons at Yulong have negative zircon εHf ( t ) and high δ18O values ( Figs . 8C - D , 9A , and 10 ; Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) .
Collectively , we propose that the magma chamber beneath Yulong was recharged by a less evolved magma , and was saturated in fluids to produce intensive alteration and mineralization .
Recent studies have shown that the postsubduction tectonic settings , such as the Miocene Gangdese belt and the Eocene Yulong belt in eastern Tethys domain , could also form porphyry Cu deposits ( Hou et al . , 2004 , 2011 , 2013 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ; Deng et al . , 2014 , 2017 ) .
The caculated results show that the early - stage euhedral high - Al ( 5 . 87–8 . 51 wt % ) amphibole phenocrysts may have crystallized in the underlying magma chamber ( 7 . 1–12 . 5 km in depth ) , whereas the late - stage xenomorphic low - Al ( 3 . 47–4 . 87 wt % ) amphibole grains may have crystallized in the porphyritic stock ( 4 . 0–5 . 6 km ) .

It is widely accepted that relatively high magmatic oxidation states ( ΔFMQ > + 1 , where FMQ is the fayalite - magnetite - quartz buffer ; Mungall , 2002 ; Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2015 ) , high water contents ( > 4 wt . % ; Richards , 2011 ) , and high sulfur and halogen contents ( Streck snd Dilles , 1998 ; Chelle - Michou and Chiaradia , 2017 ; Zhu et al . , 2018 ) are all indispensable conditions for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Journal Pre - proof Journal Pre - proof Yulong intrusion may have originated from concurrent partial melting of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related juvenile lower arc crust and a small amount of ancient crustal materials .
Journal Pre - proof Journal Pre - proof Yulong intrusion may have originated from concurrent partial melting of Paleo - Tethys subduction - related juvenile lower arc crust and a small amount of ancient crustal materials .
Nonetheless , it should be noted that the magmatic oxidation states are high throughout the magmatic evolution ( ΔNNO > 0 . 5 ) , which is consistent with the conclusion based on zircon trace element compositions ( Liang et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2016 ) .
In this contribution , 4 / 58 we present new whole - rock major and trace element geochemistry , in - situ apatite Sr - Nd and zircon Hf - O isotopes of the ore - related Yulong intrusion , with the aim of providing new evidences for the origin of the postsubduction Yulong deposit .

An alternative explanation for origin of the Yulong intrusion is the fractional crystallization of a mantle - derived mafic magma .
In addition , the relatively low contents of highly compatible elements ( e . g . , Cr ) and low Mg # values at Yulong are comparable to those of thick lower - crust derived adakite - like rocks ( Fig . 6B - D ) , which also indicates its origin from partial melting of the thickened lower crust ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) .

These values are similar to average value of the global lower crust ( δ18O = 7 . 0‰ ; Kempton and Harmon , 1992 ) , but significantly higher than the values of mantle ( 5 . 3 ± 0 . 6‰ , 2σ , Valley et al . , 1998 , 2005 ) , and higher than the magmas that predominately derived from fractional crystallization of mantle - derived parental melts ( < 6 . 5‰ ; Valley et al . , 2005 ) .
This indicates that they may have formed in similar geodynamic setting .
Several models have been proposed to account for the paragenesis of these postsubduction porphyry deposits , which include partial melting of the lithosphere mantle that was metasomatized by previous slab - derived melts / fluids ( Zhang and Xie , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Gao et al . , 2007 , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2012 , 2016 ) , partial melting of the subducted oceanic slab ( Hu et al . , 2015a ) , and partial melting of lower crustal cumulates of early arc magmas ( juvenile lower arc crust ) ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Hou et al . , 2004 , 2009 , 2011 , 2013 , 2015 ; Richards , 2009 ; Shafei et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) .

This interpretation is consistent with the conclusion based on periodic sulfur zonation in apatite crystals at Yulong ( Huang et al . , 2019b ) , and is also in agreement with the repeated exsolution of compositionally similar ore - forming fluids ( Chang et al . , 2018 ) .

Volatiles from the ridge may cause metasomatism of the mantle wedge , possibly accompanied by an increased sulfur flux due to subduction of metalliferous sediments in pressure shadow zones behind highs on the downgoing plate .
Crustal thickening and dehydration also may occur , leading to increased fluid flux ( Kay et al . , 1999 ) .
Ore grades are also partly dependent on the structure ( permeability architecture ) of the district ( leaky versus focused hydrothermal fluid - flow regimes ) , and formation and preservation of supergene enrichment blankets can also be critical to high - grade ore formation .

Interaction of these oceanic plate features with subduction zones probably best explain multiple metallogenic cycles of porphyry ore formation in a given region , as typified by the Chilean Andes , where five porphyry metallogenic belts occur in a region where subduction has otherwise continued unabated since the Cretaceous ( Sillitoe , 1988 ; Camus , 2002 ) .

From the perspective of porphyry exploration , two vital questions that need to be addressed are : why and how have giant , high - grade porphyry deposits formed ?
Other factors , such as sutures in the overriding plate , permeability architecture of the upper crust , efficient processes of ore transport and deposition , and , in some cases , formation and preservation of su - pergene enrichment blankets are also vital for the development of high - grade giant ore deposits .

In several examples , these tectonic perturbations have promoted flat - slab subduction , crustal thickening , uplift and erosion , and adakitic magmatism coeval with the formation of well - endowed porphyry and / or epithermal mineral provinces .
Of these , six of the seven giant copper and nine of the 13 giant gold deposits are known or inferred to be associated with regions where low - angle subduction of aseismic ridges , FIG .
While most of the available isotopic , fluid , and melt inclusion evidence points toward a preponderance of magmatic - de - rived fluids in porphyry systems ( e . g . , Davidson et al . , 2005 ; 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 815 Downloaded from http : / / pubs . geoscienceworld . org / segweb / economicgeology / article - pdf / 100 / 5 / 801 / 3459346 / 801 . pdf by China University of Geosciences Beijing user on 15 June 2021 816 COOKE ET AL .
The associated compressional tectonism , rapid uplift , and exhumation ( potentially leading to the superposition of porphyry and epithermal environments ) reactivation of basement faults , and a hiatus in volcanism associated with crustal thickening would favor the formation of porphyry copper deposits ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .
Although not discussed here , sutures in the overriding plate obviously play vital roles in focusing magmatism and fluid flow ( e . g . , Richards , 2000Richards , , 2003Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .

Of the remaining deposits , the gold - rich Tampakan deposit may be associated with subduction of the Snellius plateau and occurs in a region of the Philippines where adakitic volcanism has occurred ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ) , an association that also occurs in other provinces where ridges have been subducted .

Large - scale factors ( e . g . , geodynamics , lithological , and structural archi - tecture ) have constrained total metal endowments by provid - ing effective fluid pathways and controlling the generation , location , nature and size of fluid reservoirs , as well as the tim - ing and manner of release of stored fluids .
This may lead to the generation of oxidized melts that can transport copper , gold , and sulfur dioxide from the mantle to the upper crust ( e . g . , Richards , 2003 ) .
Widespread and distinctive zones of hydrothermal alteration provide a useful footprint for explorers .
Possible mechanisms of high - grade hypogene mineralization are discussed in other papers contained within this special issue .

Other ongoing controversies regarding porphyry systems that are discussed in this volume include the relative importance of cooling ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , hy - drothermal alteration ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , and fluid mix - ing ( e . g . , Frikken et al . , 2005 ) for deposition of high - grade ore in porphyry systems , the relative importance of ridge subduc - tion and flat subduction in the formation of giant porphyry deposits ( e . g . , Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ) , the nature and origin of copper mineralization at the largest of the Andean deposits , El Teniente ( e . g . , Skewes et al . , 2002 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , the duration and timing of magmatic - hydrothermal activity ( e . g . , Río Blanco - Los Bronces : Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; El Teniente : Maksaev et al . , 2004 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , and the relative importance of strike - slip , compressional and extensional tectonism during the formation of the Eocene - Oligocene porphyry belt of northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ) .
More than half of the 25 largest known porphyry copper deposits , defined in terms of contained copper metal , formed during three time periods : the Paleocene to Eocene , Eocene to Oligocene , and middle Miocene to Pliocene .

Murphy ( 2001 ) argued that the Laramide orogeny in the southwest United States was associated with flat - slab subduction , because it was characterized by an absence of volcanism , widespread hinterland deformation , and thick - skinned tectonics .

As we have al - ready shown , the Andean and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya fold belts host some of the world’s largest and highest grade porphyry deposits and have been subjected to several cycles of mineral endowment during episodes of convergent margin tectonism ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 1988 ; Camus , 2002 ) .

It is the favorable conjunction of many factors , from the crustal to the deposit scale , which appears to result in the formation of the giant deposits .

We highlight the spatial coincidence of many of the world ' s largest porphyry systems in Tertiary to Quaternary magmatic arcs with regions where subduction of submarine ridges , oceanic plateaus , and seamount chains has occurred and speculate on the importance of these tectonic " triggers " ( defined here as perturbations to the steady - state conditions of subduction ) for porphyry - style mineralization .

This review and subsequent papers in the special issue show that the produc - tion of major deposits in a terrane is commonly limited to dis - crete epochs ( e . g . , Deckart et al . , 2005 ; Hollings et al . , 2005 ; Pollard et al . , 2005 ) , implying that fluid production and / or re - lease is episodic and linked to the geodynamic evolution of the terrane .
Overall , the aim of the special issue is to help explorers and researchers better understand how and where processes of ore formation have combined effectively to produce some of the world’s largest high - grade hypogene porphyry copper and gold resources .
Over one hundred years of exploration and research has provided an excellent understanding of their geology and geochemistry .
The structural architecture of the province is also critical ( e . g . , Gow and Walsh , 2005 ) , with reactivation of base - ment faults a recurring theme in the evolution of porphyry mineral districts .
Scope of this Issue This issue of Economic Geology reports the results of new research into the characteristics and origins of porphyry cop - per - molybdenum and copper - gold deposits of Chile , Ar - gentina , and Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya .

THE TETHYAN orogenic and metallogenic belt stretches from the Alps , through the Balkans , Turkey , Iran , Pakistan , Tibet , Indochina , and ultimately into the southwest Pacific .
The Neo - Tethys ocean was characterized by the presence of numerous small continental and island - arc fragments , which are now compacted between multiple sutures along the broad Tethyan orogenic belt .
Intrusive rocks associated with porphyry Cu deposits in three separate segments of Neo - Tethyan arcs in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan display similar temporal and geochemical characteristics when compared with earlier , barren volcanoplutonic suites from the same regions .

Intrusive rocks associated with porphyry Cu deposits in three separate segments of Neo - Tethyan arcs in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan display similar temporal and geochemical characteristics when compared with earlier , barren volcanoplutonic suites from the same regions .
The porphyry - related intrusions are relatively late in the evolution of each arc and typically follow several tens of millions of years of barren volcanoplutonic activity along the same arc axis ( e . g . , Perelló et al . , 2008 ) .
The porphyry - related suites are hornblende - phyric , indicating relatively high magmatic water contents ( ≥4 wt % H 2 O ; Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) , whereas earlier barren suites are relatively dry ( plagioclasepyroxene - phyric ) .
Porphyry - related magmas are typically relatively evolved , medium - to high - K , calc - alkaline andesites - dacites or diorites - granodiorites .

Early and abundant fractionation of hornblende from these hydrous magmas ( Romick et al . , 1992 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; Rooney et al . , 2011 ) preferentially depletes the magma in MREE - HREE and Y , leading to listric - shaped REE patterns and low Y and Yb concentrations that decrease with SiO 2 ( as a measure of fractionation ) .

Porphyry deposits formed during the early to middle Miocene and Pliocene along this arc , and indeed may be actively forming today beneath large active stratovolcanoes such as Koh - i - Sultan ( and the Taftan and Bazman volcanoes along the extension of the Chagai arc into southeastern Iran ) .
Porphyry deposits may form at subvolcanic levels as a consequence of volatile exsolution from these batholithic magma chambers and the focusing of fluid flow through narrow cupola zones .
The porphyry - related suites formed in continental arcs , with thickened crust in the case of the Kerman porphyries ; the Chagai belt evolved from an early ( barren ) island arc to a later ( mineralized ) continental arc .
The porphyry - related suites are predominantly subvolcanic , with little coeval volcanism .
The high water content of these evolved magmas results in their greater tendency to be trapped in mid - to - upper crustal batholithic magma chambers ( 10 - 5 km depth ) , as opposed to being erupted at the surface , as is more typical for the earlier , geochemically more primitive and less hydrous volcanic sequences ( Winter , 2001 ; Miller et al . , 2003 ) .
For 40 Ar / 39 Ar analyses , a plateau segment is defined as consisting of three or more contiguous gas fractions having analytically indistinguishable ages ( i . e . , all plateau steps overlap in age ± 2σ analytical error ) and comprising a significant portion of the total gas released ( typically > 50 % ) .
If this flux of hot magma is maintained , then a large magma complex develops at the base of the crust ( the MASH zone ) , in which fractionation of the mafic magma and mixing with partial melts of crustal lithologic units gives rise to evolved , hybrid , calc - alkaline intermediate composition magmas , whose lower density allows them to rise into the upper crust .

Because convergent margins are commonly under a mildly compressional state of stress , crustal thickening may accompany the development of hot zones .
Fertile plutonic suites in continental arcs may be recognized by their relatively late timing with respect to voluminous plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric andesitic volcanism , the widespread presence of hornblende phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and trace element compositions featuring relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , and lack of negative Eu anomalies ( reflecting hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization ) .

Many of these deposits appear to have formed toward the end of periods of subduction ( e . g . , Bor , Majdanpek , Chelopech ; Ciobanu et al . , 2002 ; Neubauer and Heinrich , 2003 ) , or broadly coeval with collisional events ( e . g . , Sari Gunay , Sar Cheshmeh ; Richards et al . , 2006 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , or even postdating the onset of collision by up to tens of millions of years ( e . g . , Qulong ; Hou et al . , 2009 ) .
The precursor tectonomagmatic processes described above are reflected in the geochemical compositions of " fertile " arc magmas as follows : 1 .
In contrast , Miocene porphyry deposits in the Kerman belt of central Iran formed during convergence of the Afro - Arabian plate with Central Iran , the collision of which caused the Zagros orogeny .
In all cases , a long - lived , mature arc setting is required for these fertile magmatic characteristics to be developed .

Suppression of plagioclase crystallization due to high magmatic water content ( Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ) results in relatively high Sr ( undepleted ) contents that only start to decrease with SiO 2 in felsic ( dacitic ) magmas .

In each region , the late porphyry - related magmas are more geochemically evolved and more hydrous ( as evidenced by the presence of hornblende phenocrysts ) than the preceding volcanic rocks .
Together , these petrologic behaviors result in porphyryrelated rocks having relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which some have misinterpreted as a source characteristic arising from melting subducted oceanic crust ( i . e . , adakites ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Omrani et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) .

The exact timing of porphyry formation relative to final collision is unclear , but Shafiei et al . ( 2009 ) have suggested that the mid - Miocene porphyries are syncollisional and related to crustal thickening .
They commonly contain hornblende and / or biotite phenocrysts , reflecting high magmatic water contents ( ≥4 wt % H2O ) .
Nevertheless , a large deposit is unlikely to form without these underlying precursors .
Further , a sustained magmatic flux from the asthenosphere is required to extend the thermal anomaly of arc magmatism into the upper crust , where large , relatively long - lived batholithic magma chambers and subvolcanic cupolas can develop .
The processes by which low - density bubbly magmas and / or separate volatile phases are focused in the apical parts of these fractionating batholiths to form cupolas , within which porphyry deposits may form ( under the right local magmatic , structural , and hydrothermal conditions ) , have been described by numerous authors and are not repeated here ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Samples analyzed by the 40 Ar / 39 Ar method at the University of Nevada Las Vegas were wrapped in Al foil and stacked in 6 mm inside - diam sealed fused silica tubes .
A similar late timing for porphyry mineralization is observed in other porphyry belts worldwide ( e . g . , northern and central Chile , Perú , and southwestern United States ; Richards , 2003 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ) .
Conversely , relatively dry magmas formed during early stages of arc evolution tend not to stall in the upper crust , but erupt effusively and do not generate large magmatic - hydrothermal systems or porphyry deposits .
Regional - scale changes in upper - plate stress conditions may also control the commonly observed pulsation of arc magmatism and the spatiotemporal nature of metallogenic belts ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
Ca correction factors were ( 36 Ar / 37 Ar ) Ca = 2 . 67 ( ± 1 . 87 % ) × 10 −4 and ( 39 Ar / 37 Ar ) Ca = 6 . 91 ( ± 1 . 19 % ) × 10 −4 .
Compared with earlier barren volcanoplutonic rocks , the porphyry - related suites are characterized geochemically by : relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which increase with SiO 2 ( where trends are visible ) ; minimal europium anomalies ( Eu n / Eu * ≈ 1 ) ; and light REE enrichments , but flat to concave - upward ( listric - shaped ) MREE - HREE patterns , reflected in [ La / Sm ] n ≈ 4 - 8 and [ Dy / Yb ] n ≈ 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 .

It was formed during two major orogenic events , one in the earlymid Mesozoic reflecting closure of the Paleo - Tethys ocean , and the second in the early Cenozoic to Recent , reflecting closure of the Neo - Tethys ocean ( Sengör and Yilmaz , 1981 ; Glennie , 2000 ; Ilbeyli et al . , 2004 ) .
Subsequently , postcollisional alkaline magmatism has characterized the Pliocene - Quaternary period .
In contrast , earlier , barren magmas were relatively dry ( plagioclase - pyroxene - phyric ) .
Loaded tubes were packed in an Al container for irradiation .
Reliable isochrons are based on the MSWD criteria of Wendt and Carl ( 1991 ) and , as for plateaus , must comprise contiguous steps and a significant fraction of the total gas released .
This study focuses on a segment of the orogen that runs from central Iran through westernmost Pakistan , where there is a major transition from collisional tectonics ( the Zagros fold - and - thrust belt of southwestern Iran ) to ongoing subduction ( the Makran accretionary complex and Chagai volcanoplutonic belt of southeastern Iran and western Pakistan ) .
The range of compositions of samples of volcanic rock from the Paleocene Juzzak Formation is shown for comparison ( gray field ) .
The temporal and geochemical evolution of arc magmatism that culminated in porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposit formation has been studied in three separate Neo - Tethyan arc systems in central and eastern Iran , and western Pakistan .
The ultimate evolutionary product of this magmatic flux is the voluminous exsolution of volatiles in the upper crust , but whether an economic porphyry deposit forms as a result of this fluid exsolution is a function of local - scale variables ( as noted above ) .
It is thus suggested that the fertility of arc magmas within a given arc terrane can be assessed by observing the relative timing of plutonic suites ( later suites are more prospective ) , noting the common presence of hornblende or biotite phenocrysts ( indicating high magmatic water contents ) , and through lithogeochemical fingerprinting of magmatic fractionation processes ( relatively high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , and Eun / Eu * ratios ≈ 1 , indicating abundant early hornblende fractionation and suppression of plagioclase crystallization in hydrous magmas ) .

A hot zone ( Annen et al . , 2006 ) in the crust is progressively developed , whereby the flux of heat ( and mass ) from the mantle is convected upward through the crust toward the surface .
It is suggested that a prolonged period of arc magmatism ( perhaps several millions to tens of millions of years ) along the same crustal axis is necessary to establish a mature magma - processing ( MASH ) zone at the base of the crust , in which evolved , volatile - rich magmas can form .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of their host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
A common thread in these three regions is that porphyry deposits formed at relatively late stages in the evolution of host magmatic arcs , following periods of extensive volcanism lasting several tens of millions of years .
We suggest that this reflects maturation of the arc magmatic system over a period of tens of millions of years , leading to the generation of more evolved , volatile - rich magmas at later stages of the arc ' s history .
We interpret these data as reflecting increasing arc maturity and water content in progressively more evolved magma types , ultimately leading to the generation of magmas with sufficient water content to form magmatic - hydrothermal ( porphyry ) deposits upon upper crustal emplacement .
This process reflects the progressive interaction of hot , hydrous , asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived basaltic arc magmas with the upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the base of the upper plate crust , where these invading magmas stall due to their high density ( relative to crustal rocks ) .
This process reflects the progressive interaction of hot hydrous asthenospheric mantle wedge - derived basaltic arc magmas with the upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the base of the upper plate crust , where these invading magmas stall due to their high density ( relative to crustal rocks ) .
Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of the porphyry magmas and related rocks indicate that they are relatively evolved and fractionated significant amounts of hornblende prior to plagioclase crystallization as a consequence of high magmatic water contents .
Hence , a simple explanation for the fertility of the later evolved magmas is that their higher water contents resulted in plutonism rather than effusive eruption and , most critically from a metallogenic perspective , the generation of subvolcanic magmatic - hydrothermal systems that precipitated ore minerals .
Correction factors for interfering neutron reactions on K and Ca were determined by repeated analysis of K - glass and CaF2 fragments .
Key to this overall process would therefore appear to be arc maturity : it requires a significant amount of time during which the flux of magma from the mantle wedge is focused along the same crustal axis for a mature magmatic system to develop .
A similar temporal relationship is observed in other major porphyry districts worldwide , such as northern and central Chile , Perú , northwest Argentina , and southwestern United States ( Richards , 2003 ; Halter et al . , 2004 Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) .
These conditions result in progressive temporal changes in arc magmatism toward geochemically evolved andesiticdacitic magmas with high volatile ( especially H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and incompatible element contents , which are the essential starting ingredients for porphyry deposit formation ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Cline , 1995 ) .

These data are compared with published information from the Miocene Kerman porphyry belt of south - central Iran ( Hassanzadeh , 1993 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) .
In further contrast , in western Pakistan subduction of Arabian Sea crust beneath the Makran accretionary complex continues today , as evidenced by Pliocene - Quaternary calc - alkaline volcanism in the Chagai arc .
A diverse array of mineral deposit types is also associated with the belt , including volcanic - hosted massive sulfide deposits , porphyry Cu and Cu - Au deposits , and low and high sulfidation epithermal Au deposits .
In this paper we present lithogeochemical and geochronological data from Cenozoic arc - related volcanic and intrusive rocks from the Lut microcontinental block of eastern Iran and the Chagai belt of Pakistan , including rocks associated with the Eocene Shadan and Maher Abad porphyry deposits in Iran , and the Miocene Saindak and Reko Diq porphyry deposits in Pakistan .

They formed at a late stage in the development of the Urumieh - Dokhtar magmatic arc , following a major volcanic stage in the Eocene - Oligocene .
Total gas ( integrated ) ages are calculated by weighting by the amount of 39 Ar released , whereas plateau ages are weighted by the inverse of the variance .
An age of 28 . 02 Ma ( Renne et al . , 1988 ) was used for the Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine fluence monitor in calculating ages for samples .
A relatively simple model can be put forward to explain all of these temporal and geochemical relationships in terms of progressive maturity in long - lived magmatic arcs .
The diversity and transience of tectonic configurations during the evolution of this orogen has led to a complex geologic record , which in many sectors of the belt is not yet well understood .
For each sample , inverse isochron diagrams are examined to check for the effects of excess argon .
Irradiated FC - 2 sanidine standards together with CaF2 and K - glass fragments were placed in a Cu sample tray in a high vacuum extraction line and were fused using a 20 W CO2 laser .
Computer automated operation of the sample stage , laser , extraction line , and mass spectrometer , as well as final data reduction and age calculations , were done using LabSPEC software written by B . Idleman ( Lehigh University ) .
Synthetic K - glass and optical grade CaF2 were included in the irradiation packages to monitor neutron induced argon interferences from K and Ca .
Despite different ages and current tectonic settings , similar igneous geochemical trends are observed in all three districts ( e . g . , increasing Sr / Y with time ) , and the timing of porphyry emplacement is late in each district ' s tectonomagmatic evolution .
As discussed by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) , Kay et al . ( 1999 ) , Richards et al . ( 2001 ) , Haschke et al . ( 2002 ) , and Richards ( 2003 , 2005 , when an arc axis remains static for a period of several millions of years , magmatism evolves from relatively primitive tholeiitic compositions ( immature island arcs or nascent continental arcs ) to evolved calc - alkaline compositions ( mature continental arcs ) , through processes described by Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) as melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization ( MASH ) .

Scattered radiometric ages suggest Jurassic ages in the Somkhit - Karabakh zone of the Trans - Caucasus , but Au - rich porphyry systems in Turkey have mainly Eocene or younger ages ( Yigit , 2006 ( Yigit , , 2009Gugushvili et al . , 2010 ) .

The porphyry Cu - Mo - Au , porphyry - skarn - vein type Cu and Mo - Cu , epithermal Ag - Pb - Zn deposits , and even granite - related Pb - Zn - Ag deposits in South China , North China and Northeast China are proposed to be associated with partial melting of subducted Paleo - Pacific plate , particularly along sutures or major tectonic boundaries where plate breakup and plate windows may have occurred ( Mao et al . , 2005 ( Mao et al . , , 2006 ( Mao et al . , , 2008 ( Mao et al . , , 2011a ( Mao et al . , , c , d , 2013Zhou et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008aLi et al . , , 2010 .

The TEOB is of global size extending approximately for over 10 , 000 km from the western Mediterranean ( northern Africa and eastern Spain ) , across the Alps and Carpatho - Balkans , to SE Europe over the Pontides and the Lesser Caucasus through Iran , western Pakistan , Central and SE Afghanistan , the Hjndu Kush , Southern Pamirs , Karakorum and the Tibet Plateau to Myanmar and Southwest Indonesia , where it joins the Pacific metallogenic belts ( Jankovic , 1986 ; Fig . 1 ) .
The TEOB hosts the Tethyan Eurasian Metallogenic Belt ( TEMB ) - one of the world ' s major metal producing belts ( Yigit , 2012 ) , where porphyry copper systems dominate ( Jankovic , 1977 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
The TEMB can be divided into four sectors from west to east , namely : Carpathian - Balkan , Pontides - Caucasus , Iran - Pakistan , Tibet and Three Rivers - Myanmar .
The Carpathian - Balkan belt is one of the world ' s oldest mining areas , which played a major role in the history of European civilizations .

The Jinshajiang - Red River Cenozoic porphyry Cu - Mo belt , extending over 2000 km in the eastern Indian - Eurasian collision zone , is an important magmatic belt formed in an intra - continental strike - slip system in SW China .
The magmas appear to have been derived from the asthenospheric mantle , possibly with mixing of material from the buried Tethyan oceanic lithosphere , upper mantle , and / or crust ( Tran et al . , 2013 ( Tran et al . , , 2014 .

This sector was generated by the collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates , in which melting and the subsequent development of magmatic activity took place from Late Cretaceous to Paleocene .
Major Cu - Au and Cu - Mo porphyry deposits are distributed over an interval of almost 5000 km across central Eurasia , from the Urals Mountains in Russia in the west , though the Central Asian countries , Mongolia , Xinjiang ( NW China ) , Inner Mongolia and Northeast China to the east ( Seltmann et al . , 2013 ( Seltmann et al . , , 2014Yakubchuk et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2013 ) .

These deposits formed in magmatic arcs within the extensive subduction - accretion complex of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB ; or Altaids ) and Transbaikal - Mongolian Orogens , from the late Neoproterozoic , through the Paleozoic to the Jurassic .
These arcs were predominantly located on the Paleo - Tethys Ocean margin of the proto - Asian continent , but are also associated with the closure of two back - arc basins behind the ocean - facing margin .

These magmas are typically calc - alkaline to high - K calc - alkaline ( Heinrich and Neubaner , 2002 ) .
These geochemical signatures suggest that subduction played a dominant role in their petrogenesis and that residual garnet was left in the magma sources .
These porphyry - epithermal Cu - Au systems are associated with Cretaceous diorite porphyry , quartz porphyry and granodiorite porphyry , and hosted by Cretaceous porphyries and their associated volcanic rocks , as well as Jurassic clastic rocks of littoral facies .
These porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are genetically related to a suite of alkaline rocks , such as pyroxene syenite , syenite porphyry , quartz syenite porphyry , which are proposed to have been derived from the mantle ( Zhang et al , 1998 ; Deng et al . , 1998a , b ) .

These age data confirm that the porphyry Mo deposits become younger from west to east , which also fits well with the tectonic evolution suggested by Xiao et al . ( 2008 ) .
These deposits are also typical porphyry Cu - Au systems , genetically associated with quartz diorite , monzodiorite , and quartz monzonite .
The only difference is that the magma formed in the post - subduction setting contains more crustal components .
100 Ma , which are located in the Cretaceous basins of Shanghang in western Fujian province ( Southeast China ) , Yangchun in western Guangdong province ( South China ) , and Xiaoxinancha in Jilin province ( Northeast China ) .
Apart from the subduction - related porphyry Cu - Mo deposits there are several Early - Middle Jurassic large - scale porphyry Mo deposits , such as the 177 - Ma old Luming and Daheishan deposits in Northeast China ( Tan et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) , which are located in the back - arc basin south of the active continental margin .

Ling et al . ( 2009 ) suggested that the flat subduction of an oceanic ridge is responsible for the formation of the porphyry - skarn Cu - Au - Mo deposits in the Middle - Lower Yangtze River Valley in Early Cretaceous .
Indeed , our knowledge and understanding of genetic models for porphyry systems is largely from the research focus on the Circum - Paciﬁc continental and oceanic margins .
In Pakistan , Reko Diq shows two age groups , early Miocene and mid - late Miocene , whereas Saindak is of late Miocene age ( Richards et al . , 2012 ) .
From northeastern to southwestern China , this metallogenic province is bounded by the Daxing ' an , Taihang , and Xuefeng mountains in the west ( Fig . 3 ) .
Alternatively , Gao et al . ( 2013 ) linked the porphyry Cu - Mo deposits with the destruction of the North China Craton ( NCC ) keel during Late Mesozoic and inferred that the ore - bearing porphyries and associated volcanic rocks have a common parental basaltic magma , derived from partial melting of metasomatized mantle lithosphere beneath the NCC .

The latter is considered to be part of the vast Circum - Pacific ore belt .
Wu et al . ( 2005 ) suggested that the extensive Cretaceous granitic rocks , with an age range of 131 - 117 Ma in eastern China , were all emplaced in an extensional setting , as indicated by the occurrence of A - type granite , dolerite dyke swarms and metamorphic core complexes .
It is widely accepted that the initial time of the India - Eurasia continental collision is between 65 and 50 Ma ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Ding et al . , 2005 ; Searle et al . , 2011 ; Xu et al . , 2012 ) , with the main collision occurring between 55 and 50 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2009 ) .
Subsequent to subduction , remelting of the residual oceanic slab most likely further metasomatized the arc lithosphere , as described by Richards ( 2009 ) .
The ore systems are similar to those in East Qinling , with porphyry Mo in the center and peripheral hydrothermal Pb - Zn deposits ( Mao et al . , 2009 ( Mao et al . , , 2011b .
Since the Mongolia - Okhotsk Ocean closed from west to east the age of the mineralization is correspondingly younger from Early Triassic to Middle Jurassic .
In western Pakistan , subduction of the Arabian Sea beneath the Makran accretionary complex resulted in ore formation along the Chagai volcanic arc belt ( Richards et al . , 2012 ) .
The study carried out by Qu et al .

Some of the main features of the spatial - temporal distribution of Cu and Mo porphyry systems and related geodynamic processes of the three metallogenic belts are described .
At the same time , the Paleo - Pacific Ocean began subducting beneath the Siberian craton to form the Sayan - Transbaikal arc , which by the Permian expanded to become the Selanga - Gobi - Khanka arc , and for a period was continuous with the Kazakh - Mongol arc .
In the past 40 years geo - scientiﬁc research has been mostly directed at the western continental margins of North and South America , and the South - west Paciﬁc Islands .
The three stages of the geodynamic evolution and associated ore - systems in the Gangdese ore belt mentioned above are illustrated in the cartoon of Fig . 5 .
Peng et al . ( 2013Peng et al . ( , 2014 suggest that during the subduction of the Garze - Litang oceanic slab , partial melting of the subducted slab or of the mantle wedge above the slab caused the formation of abundant Triassic porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits in the Zhongdian arc .

However , Qiu et al . ( 2004 ) proposed that the Bangonghu - Nujiang Ocean opened in the Early Jurassic , then subducted towards north in Middle Jurassic and closed in Early Cretaceous .

At about 45 - 30 Ma , tectonism subsequent to the Indian and Eurasian collision resulted in east - west extension in southeastern Tibet , and caused emplacement of mantle - derived potassic magmas along the Ailao Shan - Red River shear zone ( Chung et al , 1997 ( Chung et al , , 2005 .
Intensive exploration particularly in the last decade in SE Europe , Turkey , China and Myanmar , has revealed a total resource of more than 100 Mt Cu , from about 50 porphyry copper deposits and numerous related prospects ( Mutschler et al . , 1999 ; Singer et al . , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) .

High Ca alunite , including huangite , also occurs at locations proximal to the intrusive center .
Alunite mineral composition analyzed by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spec - trometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) indicates that the Pb content decreases toward the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , Sr / Pb , and La / Pb increase markedly .
Whole - rock compositions , using only nonmineralized ( taken as Cu < 0 . 1wt % and Au < 0 . 1 ppm ) and alunite - bearing samples , show that Pb and Ag / Au , plus Hg and Ag , decrease toward the intrusive center , and Sr / Pb and La / Pb ratios increase .
Lithocaps are temporally and genetically related to intrusions that may be associated with deeper porphyry - style mineralization ( Sillitoe , 1995a ( Sillitoe , , 1999 ( Sillitoe , , 2011Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Lithocaps can have large areal extent ( > 20 km 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) and , because they resist erosion , are typically prominent at the surface , which generally makes them easy to find .
Magmatic gases such as HCl and SO2 fractionate to the vapor and , after condensing into ground water , form an acidic liquid .
Mineralization , if present , forms in a subsequent stage ( White , 1991 ) , as seen at Lepanto ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) and other 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1383 1384 CHANG ET AL .
Lithocaps elsewhere show many similar characteristics that in general indicate the potential for high sulfidation mineraliza - tion , but most are not strongly mineralized .
Silicic zones at Lep - anto , vuggy or massive in texture , largely occur in proximal lo - cations close to the feeder structure ( s ) and tend to be absent in distal locations , similar to other lithocap horizons ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .
SWIR spectral features of alunite and some trace elements in alunite show indications of sys - tematic variations relative to the Far Southeast porphyry source .
Lithocap samples of quartz - alunite , even only a few hundreds of meters away from the Lepanto orebodies , con - tain < 50 ppb Au .
Gold is not appreciably introduced during the early vapor condensate - related leaching and lithocap de - velopment , consistent with the extremely low Au content of near - surface , low - pressure magmatic vapors ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994 ; Hedenquist , 1995 ) , in contrast to the higher metal contents in high - pressure volcanic vapor ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) , and in vapor - rich inclusions from high - pressure porphyry depths ( Heinrich , 2005 ) .
Gold content is also low in alunite , dominantly below the detection limits ( App .

Geophysical signatures In the Mankayan district airborne magnetic imagery is complex and difficult to interpret , reflecting the combined ef - fects of low magnetic inclination , magnetic topography and remnant magnetization in an area with complex and variable volcanic stratigraphy and many intrusions .
Radiometric data reflect bedrock units , but show no effects of mineralization .
Alteration mapping , aided by SWIR equipment , is essential to assess the advanced argillic lithocap environment , as is mapping of lithology and structures .
Stacked lithocap horizons may occur , and in such cases the lower layers have a better chance of being mineralized ( e . g . , Quimsacocha ) .
Low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap , particularly at the end of an elongate , structurally controlled lithocap , deserve special attention , as the anomaly may be caused by demagnetization due to porphyry - style alteration , e . g . , either phyllic or advanced argillic overprint of potassic alteration .

White mica - pyrite alteration , coupled with various elements of the epithermal suite—both As and Se at Mankayan—may indicate the presence of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins , especially in a district with known porphyry or high - sufidation mineralization or large lithocaps .
An airborne geo - physics survey indicates that the Far Southeast orebody is associated with a wide zone of demagnetization due to extensive magnetite - destructive phyllic alteration .
The unconformity has a cone shape with two vent - related depressions ( Fig . 2 ) .
The Mankayan mineral district of northern Luzon , Philippines , hosts several significant ore deposits and prospects of various types within an area of ~ 25 km2 , including the Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit , the Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposit , the Victoria intermediate sulfidation epithermal Au - Ag vein deposit , the Teresa epithermal Au - Ag vein deposit , the Guinaoang porphyry Cu - Au deposit , and the Buaki and Palidan porphyry Cu - Au prospects , all having formed in a period of about 2 m . y . , from ~ 3 Ma .
The geo - logic units include ( 1 ) a basement composed of Late Cretaceous to middle Miocene metavolcanic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks ; ( 2 ) the Miocene 12 to 13 Ma tonalitic Bagon intrusive complex ; ( 3 ) the Pliocene , ~ 2 . 2 to 1 . 8 Ma , Imbanguila dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks ; and ( 4 ) postmineralization cover rocks , including the ~ 1 . 2 to 1 . 0 Ma Bato dacite porphyry and pyroclastic rocks and the ~ 0 . 02 Ma Lapangan tuff .
The alteration and its subhorizontal geometry indi - cate that it is a lithocap or coalesced lithocaps .
The Lepanto epithermal deposit is related to the underlying Far Southeast porphyry ; the quartz - alunite alteration halo of Lepanto is contempo - raneous with the ~ 1 . 4 Ma potassic alteration of the porphyry .
The Mankayan mineral district , northern Luzon , Philippines , was studied in order to develop tools for exploration in such districts , as it is the site of several large intrusion - related ore deposits and prospects .
The Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal deposit and associated lithocap host is located above and adjacent to the Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Lepanto high sulfidation epithermal deposit and associated lithocap host is located above and adjacent Far Southeast porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( Fig . 1 ) .
The hypersaline liquid causes the deep potassic alteration , whereas the vapor , being buoyant , ascends toward the surface along structures .
The unconformity between the basement and Imbanguila units channeled the flow of this condensate , facil - itated by the Lepanto fault , and the leaching and alteration along the path produced the Lepanto lithocap ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
The lithocap extends prominently to the northwest from the Far Southeast porphyry , rather than in all the direc - tions , due in part to the nature of the unconformity and the local geology .
Any condensate ascending along the unconformity to the southeast would lose its permeable channel at this eleva - tion , as hot fluids tend not to move downward .
All lithocaps have structural roots , or feeders , along which the acidic condensate ascends .
The orebodies are located at deeper positions and relatively close to the intrusive source ( Figs . 1 , 3 ) .
The alunite absorption peak at ~ 1 , 480 nm of the SWIR spectrum shifts to higher wavelength positions closer to the Far Southeast porphyry ( Fig . 9a ) .
The Pb content in alunite is lower closer to the intrusive center ( Fig . 10a ) , whereas Sr , Sr / Pb , La , and La / Pb increase ( Apps .
The airborne geo - physical data have not provided any signatures that can be confidently related directly to ore bodies .
The Guinaoang porphyry deposit and the Lepanto high sul - fidation deposit have no apparent geophysical expression .
The Victoria and Theresa vein systems can be tentatively re - lated to a zone of probable demagnetization , consistent with the white mica - pyrite alteration .
The gold anomaly in the quartz - alunite alteration of a litho - cap can be quite low ( < 50 ppb ) , even within a few hundred meters of the surface projection of underground ores .
Such low magnetic anomalies on the margin of a large lithocap elsewhere may deserve attention .
Since alunite with higher K forms in distal positions at lower tem - perature compared to alunite with higher Na , Pb also has a higher concentration in distal alunite .
As the ionic radius of Au + ( 1 . 37 ) is similar to K + ( 1 . 33 ) , it is argued that Au would have substituted in alunite if Au had been present at the time of alunite formation .
Lead in alunite is higher in distal positions ( Fig . 10a ) , prob - ably because Pb substitutes for K , as the ionic radius of Pb2 + ( 1 . 32 ) is closer in size to K + ( 1 . 33 ) than to Na + ( 0 . 98 ) .
When all whole - rock samples were plotted without discrimination , patterns were not found for any other elements of the 57 elements ( Apps .
However , alteration by itself may be insufficient to point to the causative intrusive source .
Within the lithocap that extends ~ 4 km northwest from the intrusion , mineralized roots occur up to ~ 2 . 5 km from the intrusive source , whereas most of the min - eralized horizons are within ~ 1 . 5 km of the intrusion ( Fig . 1 ) .
Normalizing whole - rock Pb to the ( Na + K ) molal content produces a proxy for the alunite mineral composition , and this ratio provides the same indications as the LA - ICP - MS analyses of alunite .
Zonation in mineralogy and texture At Mankayan , the alteration halo to structural feeders of the Lepanto lithocap and ore deposit are zoned ( Fig . 4 ) , sim - ilar to the classic zonation pattern at the structurally con - trolled Summitville high sulfidation epithermal deposit ( Steven and Ratte , 1960 ) ; the alteration zonation , from struc - ture to margin , commonly has a scale of 10s of meters .
Normalizing whole - rock Pb to the ( Na + K ) moles is a proxy for the alunite mineral composition , and as demonstrated in the Mankayan district , the ratio provides the same indication as alunite composi - tions .
Formation of high sulfidation epithermal deposits : a two - stage process Hypogene advanced argillic alteration forms during the ini - tial stage of porphyry development , during vapor discharge .
The elements Sr2 + ( 1 . 27 ) and La3 + ( 1 . 04 ) are probably more related to Ca2 + ( 1 . 06 ) than to Na + or K + , due to both ionic radii and charge considerations .
This lack of Au in the early , near - surface ( i . e . , low - pressure ) vapors explains the < 50 ppb Au anomaly in whole rock within the Lepanto lithocap .
The concealed Victoria epithermal veins consist of intermediate sulfida - tion mineralization on the southwest flank of the porphyry .
They can host high sulfidation epithermal mineralization , particularly within their fracture - controlled roots .
Signatures in alunite Alunite is commonly one of the most abundant minerals in lithocaps , as at Mankayan .
Signatures in whole - rock composition of lithocap samples The Lepanto lithocap does not have significant anomalies of Au .
There are also silicic - advanced argillic alteration patches ~ 600 m above the Far Southeast orebody at the present surface ; these are interpreted to be perched alteration .
In addition to crystal lattice effects , the solubility of these trace elements at different temperatures may also have played a role .
Where the deeper porphyry environment is exposed , the mineralized portion of the lithocap may have been eroded ( R . H . Sillitoe , pers .
For ex - ample , Pb may have a higher solubility at higher temperature in proximal locations , resulting in its transport to cooler , dis - tal location , where it is then incorporated into alunite .
The presence of a lithocap of large areal extent ( A . Arribas , pers .
The ores of these deposits are largely blind , and this study was conducted in order to identify signatures and directional indicators that would have potential application during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
Their contents in alunite have a trend that in - creases near the intrusive center ( Apps .
As noted for this lithocap , Pb , Hg , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center ( Figs . 10b , 12a ; Apps .
There are several mag - netic anomalies of relative lows present in the Mankayan district ( Fig . 14 ) , but the one above Far Southeast is special in that it is at the end of a ~ 4 km elongated lithocap .
The presence of a lithocap indicates an epithermal level of erosion , and the potential for epithermal and / or porphyry mineralization nearby .

Extensive advanced argillic alteration crops out for ~ 7 km along the unconformity between the basement rocks and the Imbanguila dacite formation and consists of quartz - alunite ± pyrophyllite or diaspore , with local zones of silicic alteration and a halo of dickite ± kaolinite .
The major - ity of ore ( ~ 70 % ) lies in structural roots , principally the Lep - anto fault ( Fig . 4 ) .
For exploration of lithocaps up to tens of square kilo - meters in size , such local alteration zonation is of limited use .
In sum - mary , the geometry of the unconformity and the spatial distribution of the rock units may have caused the asymmetry of the lithocap .

The trends shown in alunite compositions and the compo - sition of non - mineralized , alunite - bearing whole - rock sam - ples from the lithocap indicate the direction to the paleo - thermal source for the initial - stage leaching and alteration event .

This is useful , as whole - rock analyses are much less expensive , with a faster turnaround time , than LA - ICP - MS analyses .
Genetic link between porphyry and lithocap : the basic processes The genetic link between porphyry - style alteration - miner - alization and lithocap was implied in Sillitoe’s ( 1995a ) defini - tion of lithocap .
In a district without outcropping veins , exploration for such veins is typically difficult .
If there are multiple permeable layers or perched water tables , it is possible that multiple , stacked horizons of lithocap will form .
There is no systematic mineralogical or textural zoning in the Lepanto lithocap that indicates direc - tion to the intrusive source .
potential than pervasive quartz - alunite or clay alteration , par - ticularly that associated with structures .
Alternatively , the later mineralizing fluid may have been minor or nonexistent ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation of hypersaline liquid and vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .

Typically the formation of porphyry - related alteration involves the early - stage separation vapor as a magmatic critical fluid intersects its solvus ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ) .
The horizontal part of the lithocap shows a vertical zonation , with quartz - alunite in the middle and dickite ± kaolinite above and below , also at a scale of 10s of meters .
Most surface samples of the lithocap contain less than 50 ppb Au , despite many being less than a few hundred meters from underground Cu - Au ore .
The more recently discovered Victoria intermediate sulfidation vein deposit ( Cuison et al . , 1998 ; Claveria , 2001 ) , located within 1 km southwest of the Far Southeast porphyry ( Fig . 1 ) , and the adjacent Teresa vein deposit to the south , completes the assemblage of porphyry and related high - and intermediate sulfidation ore deposits in this intrusion - centered setting .
For example , the patches of advanced argillic alteration at the surface directly above Far Southeast are barren ; like - wise , the upper lithocap horizon over the Quimsacocha de - posit , Ecuador , is also largely barren ( IAMGold staff , pers .
It is critical to locate the structural feeders of lithocaps , as high sulfidation mineralization—if present—is most likely to be concentrated there .
Filtering out samples without alunite con - strains the samples to be formed under similarly acidic condi - tions , and to have the same mineralogic nature .
The variation in the ~ 1 , 480 feature of alunite is related to its Na / ( Na + K ) composition ( Fig . 9b ) , which is directly cor - related to the temperature of formation ( Stoffregen and Cygan , 1990 ) .
Most have been confirmed to be faults by mapping , whereas some northeast - trending lineaments have not been recognized in mapping and deserve exploration as possible sites for mineralized veins .
Surface signatures of concealed intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins At the present erosional surface above the Victoria inter - mediate sulfidation veins , there are subtle alteration ( illite to interstratified illite / smectite to smectite + pyrite ) and geo - chemical ( As , Se ) expressions .
In a district that contains many low magnetic anomalies , those closest to the margin of a large lithocap may deserve priority in follow - up investigation .
In addition , the pres - ence of silicic alteration is much more indicative of prospect 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1385 1386 CHANG ET AL .
The rock above this section of the unconformity is mostly dacite por - phyry and it has low permeability ( Fig . 1 ) , which would hin - der further fluid ascent and flow to the southeast .
This in - dicates that integrating geophysical findings with geological knowledge may help increase confidence in targeting .
Despite the relative ease of finding lithocaps , it may be difficult to further define the location of mineralization within , under , or adjacent to a large lithocap due to the lack of directional indicators .
To use the vectors , the outcrops of lithocap alter - ation are assumed to be genetically linked .
In the Mankayan district , the patches of advanced argillic alteration above the Far South - east porphyry lie far above the basement - Imbanguila uncon - formity ( Fig . 2 ) along which the majority of the advanced argillic alteration occurs .
At Mankayan , the intrusions related to the Far Southeast porphyry deposit exsolved the fluid which subsequently sepa - rated to hypersaline liquid and vapor ( Shinohara and Heden - quist , 1997 ) , the latter subsequently forming an acidic con - densate .
In the Mankayan district , only part of the lithocap is min - eralized .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .
Within an area of ~ 25 km 2 there are several porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal deposits and prospects ( Fig . 1 ) .
In a district such as at Mankayan with known porphyry and / or high sulfidation de - posits , or even a district containing a barren lithocap , alter - ation and geochemical anomalies can nevertheless provide in - dications of the location of vein targets worthwhile to drill test .
There is no direct surface expression of the magnetic alteration in the ~ 1 , 000 - m deep core of the Far Southeast porphyry deposit , but the ore body occurs in a large zone with obvious demagnetization , providing an indirect guide .
If the as - cending , structurally controlled acidic fluid encounters a per - meable horizon , either an unconformity or one or more rock units , the reactive fluid will flow along and cause intense leaching and alteration in that layer , creating a lithocap above and lateral from the causative intrusion ( Sillitoe , 1995a ; Hedenquist and Taran , in prep . ) .
6a , 7a ) , consistent with the distribution of high Ca alunite ( up to 3 . 9 wt % ) and huangite ( Ca alunite ) closer to Far Southeast ( Fig . 9c ) .
Importantly , this survey indicates that not all porphyry deposits are associated with a positive magnetic anomaly , if magnetite - bearing potassic alteration is overprinted by other alteration types .
It is speculated that the va - pors and subsequent acid condensates ascended from the northwestern depression , the northwestern side of which is less steep , and therefore the condensates could flow unob - structed to the northwest .
This study found that several characteristics of the Lepanto lithocap change systematically with distance from the causative intrusion : The alunite absorption peak at ~ 1 , 480 nm in the short wavelength infrared ( SWIR ) spectrum shifts to higher wavelengths where the sample is closer to the intrusive center , due to higher Na and lower K content in the alunite ; published experimental studies indicate that high Na / ( Na + K ) is related to higher formation temperature .
LITHOCAPS are horizontal to subhorizontal blankets of residual quartz and advanced argillic alteration of hypogene origin , occurring over intrusions ( Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

Hedenquist et al . ( 1998 ) demonstrated that the Lepanto high sulfidation mineralization is caused by the phyllic - stage lower salinity fluid , following early alteration that produced potassic alteration at depth and the lithocap alteration closer to the surface .
The district lies within a well - defined , 150 - km - long belt of porphyry Cu deposits in the Central Cordillera of northern Luzon ( e . g . , Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Deyell and Hedenquist , 2011 ; Hollings et al . , 2011a , b ; Waters et al . , 2011 ; Wolfe and Cooke , 2011 ) .
The northwest - striking portion is ~ 4 km long and hosts the Lepanto enargite Au ore deposit , also controlled by the Lepanto fault .
Vectors found in this study include the following : ( 1 ) the alunite peak position at ~ 1480 nm on SWIR spectrum shifts toward higher wavelength in samples that are closer to the intrusive source of acidic condensates ; ( 2 ) in alunite the Pb content decreases closer to the intrusive center , whereas Sr , La , La / Pb , and Sr / Pb increase ; ( 3 ) the whole - rock compo - sition of alunite - containing , non - mineralized ( < 0 . 1 % Cu and < 100 ppb Au ) lithocap samples can also point to the intrusive source : Hg , Pb , Ag , and Ag / Au decrease and La / Pb and Sr / Pb increase toward the intrusive center .

Thus , the geophysical survey , while not pointing directly to ore , has provided potential tar - gets for investigation in the Mankayan district .
However , this study did find geochemical patterns zoned in the Lepanto lithocap relative to the Far Southeast porphyry , the intrusive source , in selected suites of samples from the Lepanto lithocap , namely nonmineralized ( Cu < 0 . 1 wt % and Au < 100 ppb ) , alunite - bearing samples .
A prospect should not be discarded only based on a low level of gold anomaly in quartz - alunite alteration , particularly if the lithocap is large .
But not all structurally con - trolled zones of hypogene advanced argillic alteration have as - sociated lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999 ) , either because they did not intersect permeable horizons , or such horizons have subse - quently been eroded .
This study examined the surface expressions of the three principal deposits , Lepanto ( mined out ) , Far Southeast ( drilled out ) , and Victoria ( now being mined ) .

These patches are probably con - nected by fractures with the main lithocap below and thus constitute perched horizons .
One reason for this may be due primarily to hydrologic reasons , i . e . , the sub - sequent mineralizing fluid that comes after the early acidic condensate may not be able to ascend to the elevation of the lithocap , especially to the upper horizons of a perched litho - cap .
In addition , veins on the margin may terminate several hundred meters below the paleosurface , below the level of the lithocap .
In addition to the close spatial relationship ( Sillitoe , 1983 ) and an overlap in alteration and ore mineralogy ( Garcia , 1991 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) , the two orebodies have been shown to be contemporaneous and genetically linked ( Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
This genetic link was demonstrated in the Mankayan district through field observation , radiometric dat - ing , fluid inclusion studies , and stable isotope studies ( Arribas et al . , 1995 ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
The veins are not exposed , but their presence at depth is indicated by subtle alteration ( illite or interstratified illite and / or smectite or smectite + pyrite ) and geochemical ( As , Se ) anomalies at the surface .
Such findings should be widely applicable , given the common relationships noted among such deposits ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) and evidence for transitions between them ( e . g . , Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
commun . , 1999 ) is encouraging for exploration at an early stage , as it indicates extensive hydrothermal activity and potential for high sulfidation ore ; in addition , there is potential for deeper porphyry and marginal epithermal vein mineralization .
Numer - ous linear features are apparent according to digital elevation model and reduction to the pole total magnetic intensity im - ages .
Selecting non - mineralized samples re - stricts the samples to all having formed in the early leaching and alteration stage , relatively free of overprinting by later mineralizing fluids which may complicate trends .
This is consistent with the spatial distribution of the samples relative to the intrusive heat source , with Na - rich samples closest to the Far Southeast porphyry .
These vectors point to the causative intrusive source that is the potential center to mineralization , including por - phyry and high sulfidation deposits .
Such trends do not point to ore but they help to indi - cate areas with a higher potential for mineralization , because porphyry - style mineralization occurs in and adjacent to the intrusive source , and high sulfidation mineralization also tends to occur proximal to intrusive source ( s ) and related structures .
The condensate be - comes more reactive as it cools and the acids increasingly dis - sociate , and this causes leaching , forming residual quartz cores with halos of advanced argillic alteration ( quartz - alunite ± dickite - kaolinite ; Ransome , 1907 ; Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; White , 1991 ; Rye , 1993 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
At the kilometer scale , there is no systematic mineralogical or textural zonation relative to the intrusive source in the Lep - anto lithocap .
Conse - quently , these patterns indicate the direction to the intrusive 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 1384 EXPLORATION TOOLS FOR PORPHYRY & EPITHERMAL DEPOSITS , MANKAYAN Cu - Au DISTRICT 1385 source of volatiles .
It is one of the country ' s richest mining districts , both in terms of proven and potential economic value as well as abundance and diversity of hydrothermal mineralization ( Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
Erosion in the Mankayan district has been minimal since the formation of the Far Southeast - Lepanto system , < 500 m based on pressure estimates from fluid inclusion studies at Far Southeast ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) , in part due to its youth , meaning that only a portion of the quartz - alunite lithocap is presently exposed ( Fig . 2 ; com - pare the elevation of the unconformity with that of outcrop - ping quartz - alunite , formed at and above the unconformity ) .
The sample filtering practice is essential for selecting rocks formed at ap - proximately the same time and under similar conditions , and by fluids dominated by magmatic characteristics .
The directional indicators and mineralization signatures found in this study have the potential to indicate direction to the intrusive center during exploration of similar porphyry - epithermal districts .
The subtlety of signatures is strongly dependent on the erosion level ; therefore , even if such indications are not pre - sent at some erosional surfaces , e . g . , > 350 m above the upper extent of veins—similar to those in the Mankayan district— the potential of the district should not be ignored if there are other indications of mineralization potential , e . g . , mineralized fragments in an exposed diatreme , or within 2 to 3 km of a porphyry deposit or lithocap .
Amphibole compositions have also been used as an oxybarometer , based on an empirical relationship between magmatic fO 2 and a Mg index ( Ridolfi et al . , 2010 ) .

Redox effects of subduction
Oxidation of the deep oceans since the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event ( Canfield et al . , 2006 ) has led to oxidative alteration of oceanic crust at mid - ocean ridges , which generates secondary hematite and anhydrite in altered basalts ( Bischoff and Dickson , 1975 ; Shanks et al . , 1981 ; Staudigel et al . , 1996 ; Alt et al . , 2013 ) , and the deposition of relatively oxidized deepocean sediments ( Piper et al . , 1984 ; Wilson et al . , 1985 ; Chen et al . , 1996 ; with the exceptions of
Subduction of this seafloor - altered material and subsequent remobilization during prograde high - pressure metamorphism introduces these redox components into the metasomatized mantle wedge ( Alt et al . , 2012 ( Alt et al . , , 2013Andreani et al . , 2013 ) .

Copper therefore appears to behave mildly compatibly for the majority of samples analyzed from arcs and ridges , indicating the continual presence of
Intermediate composition arc magmas reaching the upper crust typically contain 50 - 100 ppm Cu ( Fig . 5 ) , which has been shown to be sufficient for the generation of large porphyry deposits from reasonable volumes of magma ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .

Copper , Au , and PGE also have different partition coefficients between various sulfide phases ( liquids and minerals ) and silicate melt .
Arc magmas are rich in sulfur relative to most other mantle - derived magmas , and this has been referred to as the - excess sulfur‖ problem by some authors ( e . g . , Sharma et al . , 2004 ; Wallace , 2005 ) , reflecting the much larger volumes of SO 2 emitted from some arc volcanoes than would be predicted from the solubility of S in co - erupted felsic lavas .
Sulfur isotopic compositions in arc magmas are typically higher than depleted mantle values of  34 S VCDT ≈ 0‰ ( up to and rarely above 13‰ ; Ishihara and Sasaki , 1989 ; Alt et al . , 1993 ) , and this has been interpreted to reflect a contribution from seawater sulfate , fixed in the subducted oceanic crust during earlier seafloor hydrothermal alteration ( Sasaki and Ishihara , 1979 ; Shanks et al . , 1981 ; Wallace and Edmonds , 2011 ; Alt et al . , 2013 ; Evans et al . , 2014 ; Debret et al . , 2014 ) or in sulfate - bearing sediments ( De Hoog et al . , 2001 ) .
Subduction of this material , along with sulfate - bearing sediments , introduces a flux of oxidized sulfur ( and other components ; Debret et al . , 2014 ) into the mantle wedge that easily swamps background mantle concentrations , with up to ~ 40 % of the subducted sulfur being transferred to the wedge via dehydration fluids ( Jégo and Dasgupta , 2013 ) , and 15 - 30 % of the flux reaching the surface in volcanic emissions ( Wallace , 2005 ) .

Fractional crystallization and devolatilization

Reduction by this process is argued to cause reduction of soluble and abundant sulfate to less soluble sulfide , leading to saturation of the magma in sulfide melt and / or minerals , and consequent depletion of the magma in metals .

Devolatilization of arc magmas begins at deep levels in the crust with exsolution of a CO 2rich gas phase , into which some SO 2 likely partitions ( Holloway , 1976 ; Newman et al . , 2000 ; Kamenetsky et al . , 2001 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; King and Holloway , 2002 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Roberge et al . , 2009 ; Blundy et al . , 2010 ) .
Typical andesitic arc magmas contain ~ 4 wt . % upon ascent into the upper crust ( Plank et al . , 2013 ) , and can be expected to saturate in H 2 O as pressure falls to 1 - 2 kb , or upon rising to depths of ~ 3 - 6 km ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
Deeply emplaced magmas ( ~ 2 kb ) exsolve a relatively saline fluid after ~ 60 % crystallization , which can efficiently scavenge chloride - soluble metals such as Cu from the residual magma ( see also Candela , 1992 ; Cline , 1995 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Huber et al . , 2012 ) .
Gold , on the other hand , may be solubilized early by dilute fluids because it is thought to be dissolved as bisulfide species rather than as chlorides ; this may explain the observation that Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits are characteristically emplaced at shallow depths ( Vila and Sillitoe , 1991 ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .
Hydrothermal fluids exsolved from these magmas will have similarly high oxidation states , approximately corresponding to the sulfur gas ( SO 2 - H 2 S ) buffer curve ( ~ FMQ = + 2 ; Fig . 7 ; Ohmoto and Rye , 1979 ; Ohmoto , 1986 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ) .
Anhydrite is also precipitated in abundance due to the high activities of dissolved sulfate ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
Copper and Mo precipitate from these fluids in response to : ( 1 ) cooling between ~ 425° - 350 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Hemley et al . , 1992 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2014b ) ; ( 2 ) the increase in fH 2 S resulting from SO 2 disproportionation ( Simon and Ripley , 2011 ) ; and ( 3 ) in the case of Mo , decreasing pH ( Rempel et al . , 2008 ( Rempel et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2012 ) .
Gold may also precipitate with these sulfide minerals ( Simon et al . , 2005 ) , and / or may stay in solution to lower temperatures as bisulfide or chloride complexes , potentially to be precipitated in the geothermal / epithermal environment ( Hedenquist et al . , 1993Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Kouzmanov and Pokrovski , 2012 ; Hurtig and Williams - Jones , 2014a ) .
Ferric iron is less mobile in hydrothermal fluids , but may cause further oxidation of sulfides to soluble sulfates during prograde metamorphism by in situ conversion to ferrous iron .
Ferric iron may also be efficiently mobilized by partial melts of the slab .
Andesitic magmas rising into the upper crust still typically contain between 50 - 100 ppm Cu , which has been shown to be more than adequate to form large porphyry Cu deposits ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ) .
MORB and island arc suites show higher mean and median Cu contents than mature arcs .
( MORB ) , and have generally concluded that there is little difference in the compositions of primitive magmas from these distinct tectonic settings ( Jenner et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , although Timm et al . ( 2012 ) found that some mafic rocks from the Kermadec arc extend to higher Cu contents than MORB .
of porphyry deposits in primitive island arcs , and the late appearance of large porphyry deposits within magmatic cycles in many continental arcs .
Few large ore deposits occur in primitive island arcs , but develop commonly after several million years of arc magmatism , suggesting that the arc magmatic system requires time to evolve to a more - fertile‖ state ( Richards , 2003 ) .
For mature and island arc suites , the overriding trend of the data seems to be towards decreasing Cu contents with differentiation ( decreasing MgO content ) , and the scatter to higher values appears more random .

The magmatic to hydrothermal transition
But sulfide saturation is also a function of the overall sulfur content of the system .
This flux of sulfate may be the main vector for oxidation of the mantle wedge ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Evans and Tomkins , 2011 ; Alt et al . , 2012 ; Jégo and Dasgupta , 2014 ) .
Such alkaline magmas might therefore have a higher potential to form magmatic hydrothermal Au deposits upon upper crustal emplacement .

These magmas are also characteristically depleted ( relative to adjacent elements on primitive mantle - or MORBnormalized trace - element diagrams ) in Ti , Ta , and Nb due to their low mobility in slab fluids and / or retention in restite phases ( Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Foley et al . , 2000 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .

Where condensed sulfide phases coexist with silicate magma , the ratio of the volume of sulfide to silicate melt ( inverse of the R - factor of Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 , where R = [ mass of silicate melt ] / [ mass of sulfide ] ) can affect the ratios of metals left in the magma , as well as their abundance .
These magmas have the potential to form Cu - rich porphyry - type deposits ( Richards , 2009 ( Richards , , 2011a .
These sulfides would then be susceptible to oxidation and / or redissolution by exsolving aqueous fluids , and transfer of the contained metals to the fluid ( Spooner , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Larocque et al . , 2000 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Stavast et al . , 2006 ; Nadeau et al . , 2010Nadeau et al . , , 2013Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Thus , sulfide minerals or melts may be stable even in quite oxidized melts if fS 2 conditions are high ( Jugo , 2009 ) , which is a characteristic feature of arc systems .

Thus , typical arc magmas might be expected to become more reduced with magnetite crystallization .
As for Fe , in a relatively oxidized melt in which most of the S is dissolved as S VI O 4 2 - ( i . e . , where the average valence of S in the melt is > + 4 ; FMQ ≥ ~ + 1 ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Beermann et al . , 2011 ) , fO 2 will increase with S IV O 2 degassing : MS VI O 4 ( melt ) = MO ( melt ) + S IV O 2 ( vapor ) + 0 . 5 O 2 ( melt ) [ eq .
Although Cu scatters to elevated values in some intermediate composition samples , the bulk of the data show a steady but gentle trend to lower concentrations with differentiation , reaching modal values of ~ 50 - 100 ppm in andesitic rocks .
Although minor amounts of Cu can be incorporated into igneous silicate and oxides phases , partition coefficients are typically less than 1 indicating that Cu behaves incompatibly with respect to these minerals ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Core et al . , 2005 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) ; consequently , their fractional crystallization will not significantly affect the concentration of metals in the melt phase .

However , magnetite does not appear suddenly on the cotectic during magmatic differentiation ( i . e . , as a - crisis‖ ) , but rather appears as a late - crystallizing end - member of the spinel solid - solution series , starting with Crspinel in primitive basaltic magmas , followed by Ti - magnetite in andesites , and magnetite in dacites ( e . g . , Macdonald et al . , 2000 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ; Spandler et al . , 2003 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Richards et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant and Macdonald , 2007 ; Zimmer et al . , 2010 ; Tollan et al . , 2012 ; Nandedkar et al . , 2014 ) .
Data for Au and PGE are sparse , and it is possible that these highly siderophile elements may be significantly enriched in residual sulfides , and may represent a source of metals for later , post - subduction magmatism .
While all volcanic arcs feature hydrothermal systems , large mineral deposits tend to form in clusters or age - related belts within these arcs , or as isolated deposits in back - arc settings .
The median log ( Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ) value is highest in the mature arc suite ( - 0 . 22 ± 0 . 39 , n = 7672 ) , lower in the island arc suite ( - 0 . 27 ± 0 . 33 , n = 2432 ) , and lowest in the tholeiitic suite ( - 0 . 69 ± 0 . 30 , n = 1147 ) ( Fig . 2 ) .
The role of sulfur on metal solubility during partial melting
considered Cu - undepleted but Au - PGE - depleted , rather than Cu - rich , and may be typical of normal arc environments where several hundred to a few thousand ppm S may be present ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Jugo , 2009 ) .

effects on magmatic sulfur content and speciation ( Métrich and Clocchiatti , 1996 ; Jugo et al . , 2005b ) .
It is this shallow - level volatile exsolution that is critical to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits , by partitioning metals from the melt into an initially high temperature , saline , S - rich hydrothermal fluid phase , in which metals are solvated as chloride , sulfide , or bisulfide complexes ( Candela and Holland , 1984 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Webster , 2004 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Pokrovski et al . , 2008 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Frank et al . , 2011 ; Migdisov et al . , 2014 ) .
Progressive mantle wedge oxidation may also be reflected in arc metallogeny .
In summary , Cu contents of arc magmas globally show a general weak trend of decreasing concentration with differentiation , with a scatter to higher concentrations in some intermediate composition rocks .
other hand , segregation of sulfide melts and minerals will strongly partition chalcophile and siderophile elements , and if large volumes of sulfide are fractionated they will strongly deplete the magma in these metals ( potentially forming orthomagmatic sulfide deposits within mafic cumulate rocks ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 6 ) .

In summary , deep crustal MASH processes affecting arc magmas result in variable degrees of Cu loss to cumulate sulfides , the amount depending on the oxidation state of the local lower crust .

The onset of magnetite fractionation in relatively evolved magmas ( ≥60 wt . %
Thus , early crystallization of abundant Fe 3 + - poor spinel corresponds with an increase in oxidation state of the magma , a process that continues despite fractionation of ( much smaller amounts of ) Fe 3 + - rich magnetite from more evolved melts .
Although some metals may be carried into the mantle wedge by the subduction zone fluids , this is not essential , because the mantle already contains substantial background concentrations of base and precious metals .

In addition to elevated water contents and oxidation states ( in many cases , as noted above ) , primary arc magmas are also enriched in a suite of volatile and fluid - mobile elements , including Cl ( 500 - 2000 ppm Cl ; Wallace , 2005 ) , S ( 900 - 2500 ppm S ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) , large - ion lithophile elements ( LILE : Rb , K , Cs , Sr , Ba , and U ) , and Li , B , Pb , As , and Sb ( Perfit et al . , 1980 ; Gill , 1981 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2012 ) .
occurs between dissolved sulfide and sulfate dominance in silicate melts at FMQ ≈ + 1 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Nilsson and Peach , 1993 ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , with high concentrations of S ( dissolved as SO 4 2 - ) possible in more oxidized magmas ( e . g . , up to 1 . 5 wt . % S ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Beermann et al . , 2011 ) .

The source of sulfur in arc magmas
Only after the arc crust has thickened and differentiated to lower density compositions will significant volumes of magma crystallize as plutonic rocks , with the potential for subsurface volatile release and hydrothermal ore formation .

In contrast , shallowly emplaced magmas ( 0 . 5 - 1 kb ) initially exsolve low salinity vapors that are inefficient in dissolving chloride - soluble metals .
Relatively high oxidation states are indicated in the majority of cases ( Frost and McCammon , 2008 ; Arai and Ishimaru , 2008 ) .
The scatter to higher Cu concentrations in some intermediate - composition samples might reflect local incompatible behavior ( as described by Jenner et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , or might be a product of sulfide accumulation or subsolidus processes ( despite efforts to screen for alteration ) .
Although these metals can all be characterized as chalcophile and siderophile in character , Au and the PGE are considered to be highly siderophile , and partition strongly into most sulfide phases relative to silicate melts ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ) , while the PGE also partition differentially into metal alloy phases ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .

However , such high sulfide / magma ratios are rarely achieved in nature ( except during the formation of some orthomagmatic sulfide deposits by bulk sulfide contamination of Sundersaturated mafic melts ; e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ; Keays , 1995 ) .
Nevertheless , small amounts of sulfide minerals are commonly present in lithospheric mantle xenoliths ( Szabó et al . , 2004 ) and arc cumulate sequences ( Richards , 2011 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Li C . et al . , 2013 ; Peng et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , indicating , as noted previously , that arc magmas remain close to sulfide - saturation throughout much of their evolution .

Consequently , magmas reaching the upper crust can be expected to undergo significant oxidation due to SO 2 loss , which on average appears to outweigh the reductive effect of magnetite crystallization .
In the case of gold , however , highly oxidized magmas ( FMQ > > + 1 ) may have limited potential for Au transport and ore formation .
The process of hydration and oxidation of the mantle wedge above the subducting and devolatilizing slab is likely to be slow and incremental , possibly requiring up to 10 m . y .
Consequently , chalcophile and siderophile elements will behave incompatibly ( where residual sulfides are absent ) or weakly compatibly ( where sulfide abundances are low ) , and will tend to partition into the silicate melt , whose sulfur load will be dominantly in the form of sulfate .

Consequently , chalcophile and siderophile elements will behave incompatibly ( where residual sulfides are absent ) or weakly compatibly ( where sulfide abundances are low ) , and will tend to partition into the silicate melt , whose sulfur load will be dominantly in the form of sulfate .
This means that oxidized magmas dominated by sulfate ( FMQ ≥ + 1 ) will be less likely to become saturated in sulfide phases .
However , while arc magmas do show an overall weakly decreasing trend of Cu concentrations with differentiation ( Fig . 4 ) , Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios and FMQ values generally increase ( as shown in Fig . 3 , and observed in individual magmatic suites : e . g . , Richards et al . , 2006Richards et al . , , 2013 .
As noted above , arc magmas have long been recognized as being more oxidized than typical tholeiitic magmas , typically in the range FMQ = + 0 . 5 to + 2 , and locally up to or above + 3 ( Luhr , 1992 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Eggins , 1993 ; Pichavant and Macdonald , 2007 ; Mullen and McCallum , 2013 ; Stamper et al . , 2014a ) .
The source of the oxidizing signature in arc magmas is thought to be subducting oceanic crust .
Moreover , these anomalously Cu - rich magmas ( if these compositions indeed reflect magmatic values ) do not clearly correlate with known porphyry Cu deposits .

large volumes of sulfide ( > ~ 1 % ) would need to unmix or crystallize from the magma before a significant proportion of the dissolved Cu could be extracted .
This suggests that magmatic Cu concentrations are moderated by the presence of minor amounts of sulfides in the source , into which chalcophile and siderophile metals ( such as Cu , Au , and the platinum group elements ; PGE ) will preferentially partition ( Keays , 1987 ( Keays , , 1995Lee et al . , 2012 ) , even for moderately to strongly oxidized rocks .

The net effect of sulfide saturation on metal concentration in the coexisting melt depends on several factors , including : ( 1 ) the metal in question ; ( 2 ) the volume of the sulfide phase relative to the silicate melt ; and ( 3 ) the nature of the condensed sulfide phase ( sulfide melt , pyrrhotite , monosulfide solid solution , intermediate solid solution ) .
The proportion of Cu lost from the magma flux in the latter case is similar to the estimated proportion of plutonic to extrusive rocks in arcs , and does not , therefore , indicate that magmas ascending from MASH zones are significantly depleted in Cu ( or that lower crustal cumulate rocks are significantly enriched in Cu ) .
The formation of a large porphyry ore deposit requires the consecutive , cumulative , and optimized execution of numerous steps , starting with the generation of sufficient volumes of
Assuming that these high - Cu values do reflect magmatic compositions , the reason for this incompatible behavior is not clear , but could be due either to low total sulfur fugacity ( unlikely in most arc settings ) or unusually high oxidation states , such that sulfide solubility was not exceeded or sulfides were destabilized by oxidation ( e . g . , Ballhaus et al . , 1991 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .

Of these species , SO 2 is likely to be the most abundant in arc magmas , and SO 2 is known to be a major component of volcanic emissions worldwide ( Wallace , 2001 ( Wallace , , 2005Sharma et al . , 2004 ) .
Direct estimates of oxidation state in the sub - arc mantle have been obtained from ultramafic xenoliths in primitive arc magmas from a number of locations around the world , and from orogenic peridotites thought to represent obducted fragments of sub - arc mantle wedge .
This narrow peak of Cu concentrations would not be expected to significantly enhance the net flux of Cu from the mantle source region because Cu contents of primitive magmas are uniformly moderate .
Water solubility in silicate melts increases with pressure ( Burnham , 1979 ; Baker and Alletti , 2012 ) .
This may explain why high Cu concentrations , reflecting the - burn - out‖ of condensed sulfide phases in highly oxidized mantle sources and magmas ( as predicted by Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Jugo et al . , 2005a ; Righter et al . , 2008 ; Timm et al . , 2012 ) is not clearly observed in the datasets shown in Figure 4 .

As discussed above , reduction will result in voluminous sulfide saturation and loss of potential to form later magmatic hydrothermal ore deposits ; this may explain the dearth of porphyry deposits in , for example , Japan , where the lower crust contains graphitic lithologies ( Sato , 2012 ; Tomkins et al . , 2012 ) .

The primary control on partial melting in the asthenospheric mantle wedge is the influx of water from the dehydrating subducting slab , which lowers the solidus temperature of peridotite ( Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Ringwood , 1977 ; Arculus , 1994 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ; Ulmer , 2001 ; Grove et al . , 2006Grove et al . , , 2012 .
As a consequence of the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event , sulfate in oxidized deep ocean waters reacts with Fe 2 + in basaltic oceanic crust to form Fe 3 + - oxides , sulfates , and some sulfides .
This is also where the calc - alkaline ( low - Fe ) geochemical character is imprinted on arc magmatic suites , caused by early crystallization of Fe - rich minerals ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Romick et al . , 1992 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Pichavant and Macdonald , 2007 ; Hamada and Fujii , 2008 ; Stamper et al . , 2014b ) .

These data suggest that Cu is mildly compatible during partial melting and fractionation processes , likely reflecting minor degrees of sulfide saturation throughout the magmatic cycle .
However , the volume of sulfides must be small such that significant proportions of the metal content remain in the magma during fractionation to intermediate compositions .
The high and increasing oxidation states of evolved arc magmas suggests that , while some condensed sulfide may indeed be present in latestage magmas , it will not be abundant , and is therefore not likely to significantly affect the overall metal budget of the system .
Global data for measured Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ratios and Cu contents in unaltered volcanic and intrusive arc rocks indicate that , on average , they are slightly more oxidized than other magmas derived from depleted upper mantle ( such as MORB ) , but contain similar Cu contents across their compositional ranges .
The reliability of these trace element ratios as proxies for magmatic oxidation states is thus unclear at the present time .
To date , no examples of large sulfide accumulations in lower crustal arc magmatic systems have been reported , with the possible exception of Alaskan - type PGE deposits ( Slansky et al . , 1991 ; Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Batanova et al . , 2005 ; Thakurta et al . , 2008Thakurta et al . , , 2014 .
Consequently , given that arc magmas globally have oxidation states in the range FMQ = + 0 . 5 to + 2 ( as reviewed above ) , they appear to be ideally suited to the transportation of Cu , Mo , Au , as well as other minor metals .
These data suggest that the asthenospheric mantle wedge is commonly up to 3 log units more oxidized than typical MORB - depleted mantle ( FMQ = - 1 to 0 ) , but that more reducing conditions may occur locally .
Processing of these largely metal - undepleted magmas in lower crustal MASH or - hot zones‖ under mildly oxidized but marginally sulfide - saturated ( high fS 2 ) conditions can be expected to leave at least some of the metal load of the magma flux in cumulates and gabbroic plutons , but available data do not indicate that these rocks contain much more than background concentrations of metals such as Cu .
Transferring the remaining metal load of the magma into a hydrothermal fluid phase that can generate porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au mineralization might be either a one - or two - step process ,
Variability in the extent of oxidative alteration and the amount of oxidized ( or reduced ) sediment may , therefore , be the primary cause of the wide range of oxidation states found in arc magmas , from essentially unoxidized ( MORB - like ) to highly oxidized compositions ( Fig . 3 ) .
Instead , the data show that relatively reduced magmas are just as likely to , but rarely do , contain anomalously high Cu contents as more oxidized magmas .
It could be argued that the sulfides have been redissolved prior to final crystallization , and that the evidence has therefore been lost ( e . g . , Larocque et al . , 2000 ) , but one might still expect to see abundant sulfide inclusions trapped in and protected by phenocrysts if this process was important , whereas these inclusions are in fact sparse .
Instead , as reviewed below , subduction ( at least since deep ocean oxidation following the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event : Evans and Tomkins , 2011 ; Shields - Zhou and Och , 2011 ; Prouteau and Scaillet , 2013 ; Richards and Mumin , 2013a ; or earlier : Jagoutz , 2013 ) appears to be associated with variable degrees of oxidation of the overlying mantle .
In the former case , numerous post - subduction scenarios , such as collision or post - collisional rifting , can be envisaged that would re - melt sulfide - bearing lower crustal

Although some have argued that slab melting might be uniquely linked to arc metallogeny because of this strong oxidative effect ( e . g . , Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) , others have questioned the evidence for this relationship ( Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002Richards , , 2012Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
On the other hand , increasing oxidation state is likely to make sulfide melt and mineral saturation less likely , whereas sulfate saturation and anhydrite crystallization may occur ( e . g . , Luhr et al . , 1984 ; Carroll andRutherford , 1985 , 1987 ; Imai et al . , 1993 ; Baker and Rutherford , 1996 ; Streck and Dilles , 1998 ; Parat et al . , 2002 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
This may explain why calculated oxidation states of primitive magmas from nascent oceanic arcs are commonly indistinguishable from MORB ( e . g . , Lee et al . , 2005 ) , but increase with arc evolution ( Evans et al . , 2012 ) .
It also does not correlate with Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios in the rocks , and both relatively oxidized and relatively reduced rocks can have high Cu contents , although this is not common in either case .

It is now clear that the excess S comes from magma chamber recharge by more mafic magmas with higher S solubility ( Hattori , 1993 ; De Hoog et al . , 2004 ; Roberge et al . , 2009 ; Van Hoose et al . , 2013 ) .

This , suggests that either the magnetite effect is not significant , or that other processes are countering it ( e . g . , Fe 2 + - rich silicate mineral fractionation ) , or both .
The arc samples are divided into continental plus mature island arc ( hereafter referred to as - mature arc‖ ) and island arc suites .
Mungall ( 2002 ) has argued that slab melts would carry more iron , and in particular Fe 3 + , than hydrothermal fluids , and would therefore potentially be stronger oxidants than aqueous fluids .
The resulting primary magmas are hydrous , tholeiitic , high - Mg basalts ( Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) , which evolve to calc - alkaline compositions by early fractionation of olivine , clinopyroxene , and magnetite , and later crystallization of hornblende and plagioclase ( Grove and Kinzler , 1986 ; Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ) .

In contrast , in the latter case ( preconcentration of metals in lower crustal sulfide cumulates ) it is not clear what would cause a change from sulfide - saturated to sulfide - undersaturated conditions if nothing else changed during a normal cycle of sulfur - rich arc magmatism .

However , this modest increase in oxidation state is sufficient to shift the balance between dissolved sulfide and sulfate components in the melt towards more soluble sulfates , allowing the magmas to dissolve much larger amounts of sulfur than reduced magmas .
This method has the advantage that amphibole is commonly present in arc plutonic and volcanic rocks , but its dependence on multiple element electron microprobe analyses , and the commonly complex history of amphiboles in igneous rocks leads to a relatively high degree of uncertainty in the interpretation of the results .

However , a clear correlation with high magmatic oxidation state is not observed , and it cannot therefore be concluded that oxidized magmas are inherently more fertile ( with respect to Cu content ) than more reduced magmas .
A major proportion of the world ' s Cu , Mo , and Au is mined from hydrothermal ore deposits ( typically porphyry and epithermal deposits ) associated either directly or indirectly with subduction - related magmas .
Thus , processes that could deplete magmas in ore metals could significantly reduce their fertility , and vice versa .
Several authors have suggested that late - stage sulfide saturation prior to volatile exsolution in the upper crust might be an important preconcentration step , by first partitioning chalcophile and siderophile metals into a sulfide melt or crystalline phase .

When plotted against FeO Total , the arc rocks predominantly plot in the - moderately oxidized‖ to - strongly oxidized‖ fields of Blevin ( 2004 ) , whereas the tholeiites are centered on the - moderately reduced‖ field ( Fig . 3 ) .

These hydrous compositions predispose arc magmas to developing - adakite - like‖ trace element signatures of Sr enrichment and heavy rare earth element ( HREE ) depletion , through early and abundant crystallization of pyroxene and hornblende ( which preferentially partition middle ( MREE ) and HREE ) , and late crystallization of plagioclase ( which would otherwise deplete the melt in Sr ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ;

Sparsity of data for elements such as Au and PGE means that it is not clear whether these metals behave in the same way ( see discussion below ) .
The data in Figure 3 suggest that most arc magmas are moderately oxidized , but can become strongly oxidized ( and in some cases reduced ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) , during differentiation .
Chief among these oxidants is probably sulfate , originally derived from seawater and fixed in altered seafloor basalts or sediments .
Whether or not they are also enriched in metals is discussed below .
A similar conclusion has been drawn for gold in arc magmas ( Jégo and Pichavant , 2012 ) .
These trends appear to be independent of oxidation state , and there is no clear correlation between rocks with higher Cu concentrations and porphyry ore deposits .

In addition to promoting plutonism , the thickening of arc crust has multiple chemical effects on arc magmatism , including extending the range of magmatic differentiation and interaction with older crustal materials .

The most profound effects likely occur in deep crustal MASH zones ( or - hot zones‖ ; Annen et al . , 2006 ) , which transform and homogenize the flux of basaltic arc magma from the asthenosphere into evolved , intermediate - composition magmas ( basaltic andesites to andesites , and locally more felsic melts derived by crustal melting ; Romick et al . , 1992 ; Eichelberger et al . , 2006 ; Mišković and Francis , 2006 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Lee and Bachmann , 2014 ) .
An additional factor may be the presence of platinoid metal alloys in the mantle source , which can dramatically fractionate the PGE ( Park et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
The metals of greatest economic interest in subduction zone magmas are Cu , Au , and the PGE .
The data also do not support the notion that arc magmas in general are fundamentally more fertile ( Cu - rich ) than other mantle - derived magmas such as MORB tholeiites ; if anything the opposite is true , which must mean that other processes are involved in the relationship between arc magmas and porphyry Cu deposits .
Suffice to say , the interplay between these various redox buffers and fractionating mineral compositions is complex and poorly understood at this time , but the bulk empirical data suggest that progressive , mild oxidation with fractionation of arc magmas is more common than reduction .
Instead , the relatively high and increasing oxidation state of evolved arc magmas reaching the upper crust ( FMQ = + 1 to + 2 ) suggests that the bulk of S in these magmas is present as sulfate ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) , with sparse sulfides being stable only because of high total sulfur fugacity ( and therefore also high fH 2 S ) .
Relatively few suites of geochemical data for arc rocks include direct estimations of oxidation state , but where separate chemical analyses of FeO have been made , the Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ratio can be used as a proxy .
On the other hand , it is also clear that most arc magmas ( whether relatively oxidized or reduced ) retain ~ 50 ppm Cu on average into the andesitic range of compositions , which is also the value used by Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) to show that normal arc magmas are capable of generating large porphyry Cu deposits .

The process most widely recognized as having an oxidative effect on magmas as they rise towards the surface is devolatilization , especially of reduced or weakly oxidized gaseous species such as H 2 , H 2 S , and S IV O 2 ( Mathez , 1984 ; Candela , 1986 ; Gaillard et al . , 2001 ; Holloway , 2004 ; Burgisser and Scaillet , 2007 ; Zimmer et al . , 2010 ) .
Kelley and Cottrell ( 2009 ) further showed that Fe 3 + / Fe ratios in arc magmas increase towards the trench and correlate with concentrations of H 2 O and fluid - mobile elements ( e . g . , Ba / La ) , indicating that the oxidation effect is a function of the degree of subduction metasomatism ( see also : Carmichael et al . , 2006 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ; Zimmer et al . , 2010 ; Brounce et al . , in press ) .
Such conditions appear to be relatively rare in normal arc settings , but may arise in alkaline back - arc magmas ( Richards et al . , 1991 ; Métrich and Clocchiatti , 1996 ) , and / or during second - stage S - undersaturated melting of subduction modified mantle , where a flux of fresh S from the subducting slab is no longer present ( Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Dale et al . , 2012 ) .
However , there are also a few examples of lower oxidation states , such as spinel harzburgite and websterite xenoliths from Patagonia , with FMQ = - 1 . 1 to - 0 . 2 ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; see also Malaspina et al . , 2010 ) .
In particular , the presence of small amounts of Pt - Fe alloy as restite in the mantle source region may have a profound effect on PGE abundances and ratios in partial melts ( Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Park et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) .
On the other hand , Laubier et al . ( 2014 ) used V / Yb ratios to argue for increasing magmatic oxidation state from MORB ( FMQ ≈ 0 ) , through back - arc basins , to arcs ( ~ FMQ ≥ + 2 ) .
Examples of such debates include the abundance of Au in lamprophyres ( Tilling et al , 1973 ; Rock and Groves , 1988 ; Wyman and Kerrich , 1989 ) , and Cu and Au in arc magmas ( Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Core et al . , 2006 ; Timm et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2013 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
Lee et al . ( 2005 ) interpreted relatively uniform V / Sc ratios in both MORB and arc basalts to indicate fO 2 values of FMQ = - 1 . 25 to + 0 . 5 , and argued that the higher fO 2 values calculated for many arc volcanic rocks by other methods might reflect differentiation processes rather than source characteristics .
But because of its critical importance in both the fixing and solvating of metals , it is worth briefly reviewing the evidence for the source of this sulfur , and how its nature may have changed over geological time .
While the presence of sparse sulfide inclusions in phenocrysts in plutonic rocks associated with porphyry deposits is not uncommon ( op .
The additional essential presence of water in these magmatic - tohydrothermal systems is taken as read ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1992 ; Richards , 2011b ) .
Examples are summarized in Figure 1 , and include : spinel lherzolite xenoliths from Ichinomegata , Japan , with FMQ = 0 to + 1 . 2 ( Wood and Virgo , 1989 ) ; spinel peridotite xenoliths from Simcoe volcano , Washington , USA , with FMQ = + 0 . 3 to + 1 . 4 ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) ; hornblende - bearing spinel lherzolite and websterite xenoliths in andesites from central Mexico with FMQ = + 1 . 5 to + 2 . 4 ( Blatter and Carmichael , 1998a ) ; spinel peridotite xenoliths from several arcs with FMQ = + 0 . 3 to + 2 . 5 ( Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Parkinson et al . , 2003 ) ; metasomatized peridotite xenoliths from Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , with FMQ = + 1 . 8 to + 2 . 0 ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) ; peridotite xenoliths from Shiveluch
In the preceding discussion , the high abundance of sulfur in arc magmatic systems has been noted .
Finally , the nature of the restite or fractionating sulfide or alloy phase also has a significant effect on metal partitioning .
Evidence from other redox - sensitive elements such as vanadium have yielded conflicting results .
Regardless of the exact process , it is clear that both fluids and melts are capable of transferring the oxidized signature of seafloor alteration and sediments into the mantle wedge source of arc magmas , and that the effect does not need to be extreme to raise the fO 2 of these magmas 1 or 2 log units above normal MORB - depleted mantle values to the range typical or arc magmas ( Evans , 2012 ) .
In particular , Li and Audétat ( 2013 ) suggest that the mantle sources of potassic magmas might be saturated in monosulfide solid solution ( MSS ) rather than a sulfide liquid , into which Au has a lower partition coefficient .

Under mantle conditions , it would seem likely that some sulfide liquid is present , and that it will have a major control on the abundances and ratios of chalcophile and siderophile elements in arc magmas , particularly if these sulfides are preferentially left in the restite rather than being entrained in the magma , due to their density and wetting properties ( as suggested by Mungall and Su , 2005 ) .

Few data exist for concentrations of other metals such as Au and PGE in arc cumulates and magmas , but the higher partition coefficients of these elements between sulfide phases and silicate melts suggest that evolved arc magmas might indeed be relatively depleted , consistent with the relatively low abundances of Au and particularly PGE in many porphyry Cu deposits , and the occurrence of PGEs in Alaskan - type layered intrusions ( e . g . , Spandler et al . , 2000 ; Batanova et al . , 2005 ; Thakurta et al . , 2014 ) .

They are compared to a similarly selected suite of 1 , 147 non - arc tholeiitic ( MORB ) volcanic and plutonic rocks , presumed to be derived from normal depleted upper mantle .
In general , partition coefficients seem to be highest for sulfide liquids ( Li and Audétat , 2012 ; Laurenz et al . , 2013 ; Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , followed by intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) for Cu and Au ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) , monosulfide solid solution ( MSS ; Li and Audétat , 2012 ) , and pyrrhotite ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Zajacz et al . , 2013 ) .

Salinity of the exsolved fluid increases at late stages of crystallization ( ≥90 % ) , but by this point most of the metal content of the magma has been locked up at background concentrations in crystals .

A perennial debate in economic geology revolves around whether ore - generating magmas are unusually metal - rich at source , or whether ore formation results from magmatic and / or hydrothermal processes operating on otherwise - normal‖ magmas .
The distribution of data shown in Figures 4 and 5 suggests that Cu contents in mafic to intermediate magmas from both arc and ridge tectonic settings are similar and generally quite low ( < 200 ppm , similar to values obtained by Lee et al . , 2012 , in mantle melting models ) .

In addition , Righter et al . ( 2004 ) have shown that , while Re , Au and Pd are incompatible in Cr - spinel , Rh , Ru and Ir are strongly compatible in this mineral , potentially leading to significant fractionation
It might be argued that it is these exceptions that give rise to ore deposits , but the effect is not particularly large - rarely more than 2 to 3 times average Cu contents - and thus at most might be expected to affect the size but not the existence of a deposit , and it occurs over a relatively narrow range of intermediate magma compositions ( 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ) .
These processes have been collectively termed MASH , standing for crustal melting , assimilation , storage , and homogenization of arc magmas ( Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ) .
If residual sulfide abundances are high relative to the volume of magma ( R < 10 2 ) , all chalcophile and siderophile elements will be depleted in the magma ( Fig . 6 ; Keays , 1987 ) .

However , petrogenetic and geochemical considerations suggest that slab melting only occurs in exceptional circumstances in Phanerozoic arcs , such as the subduction of young , hot oceanic lithosphere , or at slab windows or tears where hot asthenosphere directly contacts subducted oceanic crust ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock et , 1994 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

A key reaction from the point of view of ore deposition from these magmatic - hydrothermal fluids is the disproportionation of SO 2 ( the predominant sulfur species in high - temperature fluids ) to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 , which occurs progressively as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Whitney , 1988 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ) :
The significance of the flux of water and oxidized sulfur from the slab is that it lowers the solidus of peridotite causing partial melting , and lowers the stability of condensed sulfide phases ( melts or minerals ) while maintaining a high fS 2 .
To date , no convincing evidence has been found for the necessity of unusually metal - rich magmas in most ore - forming environments , but it is also obvious that unusually metal - poor magmas would not be optimal for ore formation .
As discussed by Richards ( 2009 ) , the presence of moderate amounts of residual sulfide relative to a large volume of silicate melt ( e . g . , ~ 0 . 001 - 1 wt . % sulfide ; intermediate Rfactor of 10 2 - 10 5 ; Fig . 6 ) will deplete the magma in low - abundance , high partition coefficient elements such as Au and PGE ( highly siderophile elements ) but may have little effect on the concentration of more abundant elements with lower partition coefficient such as Cu , leading to high Cu / Au , Cu / PGE magmas ( e . g . , Park et al . , 2013 ; Fig . 6 ) .

With cooling below ~ 450 °C , the SO 2 - H 2 S buffer curve crosses the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 7 ) , as reflected in the commonly observed late - stage oxidation of early hydrothermal magnetite ( associated with chalcopyrite in potassic alteration ) to hematite + pyrite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sun et al . , 2013 ) .
However , it is notable that this proportion is similar to the volume of arc magma crystallized in plutons versus being erupted at surface ( ~ 80 % vs . ~ 20 % , respectively ; Carmichael , 2002 ; Sadofsky et al . , 2008 ; Barker et al . , 2013 ) .

Consequently , the chemical behavior of these elements in the presence of sulfides and alloys can be expected to be substantially different , and this may explain the widely variable Cu / Au and Cu / PGE ratios in resultant ore deposits .

Using the same dataset as for Figures 2 and 3 There is a broader scatter to higher Cu contents in tholeiitic and island arc rocks in the range 3 - 7 wt . % MgO ( which corresponds to the peak in Cu concentration ) compared with mature arcs ( Fig . 5 ; mature arc : mean = 59 . 9 ± 42 . 6 , median = 46 . 9 ppm , n = 1247 ; island arc : mean = 94 . 0 ± 58 . 9 ppm , median = 85 . 0 ppm , n = 372 ; tholeiite : mean = 117 . 5 ± 64 . 2 ppm , median = 110 . 0 ppm , n = 115 ) .

A question therefore remains as to what conditions convert potential to actual ore formation ?
The time required for this transition can be expected to vary depending on the subduction rate , angle of subduction , and other factors , but likely takes on the order of 10 m . y .
Thus , segregation of this material does not seem to significantly deplete the remaining magma in Cu ( or Mo ) , although Au and PGE may be lost .
Evidence from experimental petrology and deep arc crustal sections confirm that olivine , pyroxene , amphibole , and magnetite are early crystallizing phases from hydrous arc basalts , with plagioclase appearing relatively late on the cotectic ( Blatter and Carmichael , 1998b ; Moore and Carmichael , 1998 ; Müntener et al . , 2001 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Tollan et al . , 2012 ; Nandedkar et al . , 2014 ) .

Jenner et al . ( 2010 ) attribute this trend to initial incompatible behavior of Cu , followed by change to sulfide saturation triggered by the onset of magnetite crystallization ( the - magnetite crisis‖ ) , or volatile exsolution ( Sun et al . , 2004 ) .
This timeframe is consistent with the relatively late timing of porphyry systems in island arc settings and in continental arc magmatic cycles ( Mitchell and Bell , 1973 ; Kesler et al . , 1977 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ) .
For example , in a volcanic suite from the Neogene Antofalla volcano in Argentina , spinels ranged from chromite in basaltic andesites , through Ti - rich magnetite in andesites , to Ti - poor magnetite in dacites , with log ( Fe 2 O 3 / FeO ) ratios increasing from - 0 . 40 in chromite ( significantly lower than the median ratio of - 0 . 22 in arc magmas ) to 0 . 19 in Ti - poor
The distribution of the bulk of the data suggests that , under most conditions , the mantle sources of arc and ridge magmas are sulfide - saturated ( Keays , 1995 ) , and that most of these magmas remain saturated or close to saturation throughout their differentiation history .

The purpose of this review has been to explore the roles of one intensive parameter ( oxidation state ) and one extensive parameter ( sulfur content ) in arc magma - genesis and metallogeny .
to achieve a steady state condition of 1 or 2 log fO 2 units above background depleted mantle values ( e . g . , up to FMQ ≈ + 1 ) .
Although there is considerable debate in the literature about the exact mechanism of the slab - to - wedge transfer process , the chief contenders are hydrothermal fluids ( Ringwood , 1977 ; Perfit et al . , 1980 ; Tatsumi , 1989 ; Peacock , 1993 ; Bali et al . , 2011 ) , partial melts of hydrated basalt ( Kay , 1978 ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Rapp and Watson , 1995 ) , partial melts of sediments ( Johnson and Plank , 1999 ; Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ; Behn et al . , 2011 ; Labanieh et al . , 2012 ) , supercritical fusions of these components ( Bureau and Keppler , 1999 ; Kessel et al . , 2005 ; Kawamoto , 2006 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) , or combinations of all of the above at different depths in subduction zones .
In contrast , Zajacz et al . ( 2012 ) and Sun et al . ( 2014 ) have respectively shown that Cu and Mo solubilities increase steadily with increasing fO 2 , because these metals are dissolved predominantly as oxide species ( CuO 0 . 5 and MoO 3 ) rather than as sulfides .

These two parameters together exercise fundamental controls on the behavior of metals during partial melting in the mantle , differentiation in the crust , and during volatile exsolution and cooling .
In their seminal study , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) showed that the depth of emplacement of the source magma body critically affects the availability of metals and the salinity of the exsolved
Mathez ( 1984 ) , Mallmann and O ' Neill ( 2009 ) , and Lee et al . ( 2010 ) have suggested that whole - rock Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios may be affected by late stage differentiation or degassing processes , but the clear relative difference between these two major magma suites , which is largely independent of degree of differentiation ( the weak inverse correlation with [ FeO Total ] is accounted for in the slope of the field boundary lines in Fig . 3 ) indicates that this is a source feature and not a process overprint ( Carmichael , 1991 ; De Hoog et al . , 2004 ; Crabtree and
Likely , this effect is also to some extent cumulative , resulting in a progressive increase in oxidation state of the supra - subduction zone mantle wedge from typical mantle values ( FMQ = - 1 to 0 ) at the onset of subduction , to FMQ ≥ + 1 after a few million years of static arc development ( i . e . , arc magmatism focused along a fixed axis in the upper plate , implying steady - state subduction conditions ; Evans , 2012 ) .
Unfortunately , because of the difficulty and expense of obtaining accurate trace - level analyses of Au and PGE in igneous rocks , there is very little information on their abundance in arc rocks ( certainly compared to the wealth of data for Cu ) .
Occam ' s razor suggest that , in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary , the simpler one - step magma - to - fluid partitioning process can efficiently form large porphyry deposits , and the processes involved are well established in the literature .
Sato ( 2012 ) and Tomkins et al . ( 2012 ) have proposed that such conditions might occur where reduced , graphitic rocks are present in the lower crust .
In contrast , under high R - factor conditions ( R > 10 5 ) , where vanishingly small amounts of ( or no ) residual sulfides are present in the mantle source and during differentiation , derivative magmas will be undepleted even in highly siderophile elements , and can thus potentially lead to the formation of Au - or PGE - rich deposits ( Fig . 6 ; Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This reaction , for the first time in the evolution of typical arc magmatic to hydrothermal systems , generates high activities of dissolved sulfide , which cause the early precipitation of Cuand Mo - bearing sulfide minerals ( chalcopyrite , bornite , and molybdenite , along with pyrite ) .

Similar arguments have been made by Mallmann and O ' Neill ( 2009 ) , and by Lee et al . ( 2010 ) on the basis of Zn / Fe ratios .
This crystallization sequence not only results in early Fe - depletion relative to alkalis , but can also generate high Sr / Y and HREE - depleted compositions ( high La / Yb , low Yb and Y concentrations ) that resemble adakites ( Castillo et al . , 1999 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ; Takahashi et al . , 2005 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .
5 ] ( where M is an element such as Ca or Fe ; Baker and Rutherford , 1996 ) , whereas fO 2 will decrease in a more reduced melt ( i . e . , where the average valence of S in the melt is < + 4 ; FMQ ≤ ~ + 1 ) : An additional late - stage oxidative process that has been proposed by Bell and Simon ( 2011 ) is the exsolution of saline fluids , in which Fe 2 + is more soluble than Fe 3 + , again having the effect of increasing the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratio in the residual magma .
The majority of experimental and analytical observations suggest that seafloor alteration and sedimentation since the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event introduces a flux of oxidized components into the mantle wedge upon subduction and slab devolatilization .
In particular , Richards and Mumin ( 2013a , b ) suggested that this characteristic might explain the relative rarity of Precambrian porphyry deposits ( in addition to preservation considerations ; Kesler and Wilkinson , 2006 ) .
The logical result of sequestering metals in cumulates at the base of the crust would be to reduce the potential for the fractionated magmas subsequently to form magmatic - hydrothermal ore deposits , rather than being a key step in their formation .
The efficiency of this partitioning process is controlled by several factors , governed primarily by the availability of metals in the melt , the volume of hydrothermal fluid exsolved relative to the volume of melt , and the efficiency with which that fluid physically mixes with the melt as bubbles prior to separation as a discrete volatile plume ( Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ) .
Botcharnikov et al . ( 2011Botcharnikov et al . ( , 2013 have shown that , up to FMQ ≈ + 1 , gold solubility increases in S - bearing basalts - andesites , but drops off sharply at higher oxygen fugacities as sulfide , with which Au combines to dissolve in the melt , breaks down to sulfate .
Lee et al . ( 2012 ) and Chiaradia ( 2014 ) further suggest that such processes could lead to a significant accumulation of metals within the lower crust , such that 70 - 80 % of the Cu in the magma flux might be sequestered in arc cumulate rocks ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) suggest that primary magmatic water contents of 2 wt . % separate the - dry‖ tholeiitic olivine - plagioclase - orthopyroxene fractionation trend from the - wet‖ calc - alkaline trend , which is consistent with estimates of water contents in primary and primitive arc magmas of between 1 and 8 wt . % H 2 O ( typically 2 - 6 wt . % ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Carmichael , 2002 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Cervantes and Wallace , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Ruscitto et al . , 2012 ; Plank et al . , 2013 ; Edmonds et al . , 2014 ; Kimura and Ariskin , 2014 ) .
Evans and Tomkins ( 2011 ) , Prouteau and Scaillet ( 2013 ) , and Richards and Mumin ( 2013a , b ) have proposed that , prior to the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event , arc magmas were more reduced and less S - rich , and thus less prospective for the formation of porphyry - type magmatichydrothermal Cu ± Au deposits .

Jenner et al . ( 2010Jenner et al . ( , 2012 , Sun et al . ( 2011 ) , Lee et al . ( 2012 ) , and Chiaradia ( 2014 ) all note an apparent increase in Cu content with differentiation in mafic arc magmas prior to a decrease once intermediate compositions are reached ( cf .
Contrary to the findings of Jenner et al . ( 2010 ) , the data do not support a general and sudden switch from incompatible to compatible behavior of Cu at intermediate compositions ( suggested to be caused by sulfide - saturation triggered by magnetite crystallization ) .

This process is sometimes referred to as - first boiling‖ ( due to decompression upon ascent ) , whereas - second boiling‖ is caused by post - emplacement crystallization and concentration of water in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989 ) .
Likely these two processes overlap , but it is clear that the bulk of dissolved magmatic water exsolves during second boiling at relatively shallow levels in the crust , whereas CO 2 , which has much lower solubility in silicate melts , begins to degas much earlier and at depth ( i . e . , during first boiling ; Holloway , 1976 ; King and Holloway , 2002 ) .
Their effects on metallogenic potential depend largely on whether they cause substantial loss of metals from the magma to crystallizing phases , prior to ascent into the upper crust and partitioning of those metals into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid ( Spooner , 1993 ) .
Blevin ( 2004 ) suggests that the boundary between the - moderately reduced‖ and - moderately oxidized‖ fields approximates the FMQ buffer curve , which is consistent with the majority of tholeiites being at or below FMQ , and arc magmas lying above this buffer .
Chiaradia ( 2014 , p . 44 - 45 ) explains this apparent contradiction by appealing to - a special combination of regional to local scale conditions [ to ] allow the successful transfer of the deep Cu accumulations to shallower levels and the formation of large porphyry copper systems‖ , but calling upon undefined special processes does not seem a very satisfactory model to explain the formation of a common and widespread ore deposit type .
With the possible exception of some dikes associated with the Bingham porphyry , Utah ( which contain up to 0 . 1 modal % sulfide globules ; Keith et al . , 1997 ) , such high sulfide concentrations have not been observed in porphyry - related intrusive rocks .
As temperatures continue to cool and equation 8progresses further to the right , the fluids become increasingly acidic from the dissociation of H 2 SO 4 ( and HCl ; Hedenquist and Taran , 2013 ) , leading to the characteristic formation of sericite ( phyllic alteration ) and then clays ( argillic alteration ) in originally feldspar - stable wallrocks ( potassic alteration ; Hemley and Jones , 1964 ; Montoya and Hemley , 1975 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Reed et al . , 2013 ) .
But SO 2 loss increases dramatically upon water saturation at shallower levels in the crust ( 5 - 10 km ; Burnham , 1979 ; Wallace , 2001Wallace , , 2005 , and is almost quantitative upon eruption at surface ( whole - rock S contents of erupted arc magmas are much lower than estimated magmatic values ; Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ; Alt et al . , 1993 ) .
Wang et al . ( 2007 ) , Song et al . ( 2009 ) , and Malaspina et al . ( 2010 ) have suggested that subduction of reduced , organic carbon - bearing sediment may be responsible for these lower values , but the data suggest that this is not a widespread condition in arcs .
cit . , and Borrok et al . , 1999 ) , it is not clear how important this process is to enhancing the efficiency of magma - to - fluid transfer of metals , or whether this two - step process is more efficient than a one - step process of partitioning metals directly from the melt into an exsolving volatile phase ( Candela and Holland , 1984 ; Cline and
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is a key factor that controls the formation of porphyry Cu deposits .
Porphyry Cu deposits are typically oxidized , but when and how porphyry magma gain their high oxygen fugacity signatures , and how oxygen fugacity controls porphyry mineralization , remains obscure .
High oxygen fugacity of the magma ( ~ ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) is generally taken as a critical parameter in the genesis of porphyry Cu deposits ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2016 ; Sun et al . , 2013 ) .
Adakite was defined initially as the product of partial melting of subducted MORB ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) with or without involvement of the mantle wedge ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Rapp et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .
Adakites form through partial melting of subducted young oceanic slabs ( ≤25 Ma ) ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) or young mid ocean ridges ( Sun et al . , 2010 ) .
Oceanic crusts older than 25 Ma are not easy to be melted during plate subduction .
Partial melting degree of 5 - 30 % of slab melting model may account for the Dexing magma characteristics , which is plotted in the adakite area ( Fig . 6 A and B ) .
Mineralization is essentially the enrichment of ore forming elements .

Hydrothermal and magmatic activities are the two major processes that enrich ore - forming elements .
Porphyry Cu deposits are a magmatic hydrothermal system , such that Cu is further enriched relative to the primary magmatic values during hydrothermal processes .
Stabilization of sulfides indicates a low oxygen fugacity , which dramatically reduces the copper concentration , such that cannot necessarily result in Cu enrichment ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) .
The intensive magmatic activity in the South China block appeared during Mesozoic era , which is attributed to subduction of the paleo - Pacific plate ( He et al . , 2010 ; Jiang et al . , 2009 ; Li and Li , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2007b ; Wang et al . , 2011 ; Zhou and Li , 2000 ; Zhou et al . , 2006 ) .
The zircon oxygen fugacities from several porphyry Cu deposits worldwide are estimated and compared with Dexing ( Fig , 5 ) .
The mineralized porphyry magmas exhibit a consistently high oxygen fugacity of ~ ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 on average .
the arc - like segments in the thickened juvenile lower crust ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) .
The element partitioning of accumulated fractional melts is similar to batch melting process ( see Supplementary Material for the details of this model ) .
The trace element compositions of oceanic slab ( Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) and lower crust ( Rudnick and Fountain , 1995 ) are used as initial values for modeling .
The Cu concentration of accumulated fractional melts is based on the partition coefficients , especially the sulfur solubility in the melt , which is mainly controlled by oxygen fugacity ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ; Wood , 2013 , 2015 ) .
The sulfur and copper content of the lower crust are 400 ppm and 30 ppm , respectively , based on the estimation from Rudnick and Fountain ( 1995 ) .
The Cu concentrations in aggregated melts of slab melting and lower crust partial melting are compared to mantle wedge partial melting ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , on a range of oxygen fugacity from ΔFMQ + 0 to ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ( Fig . 7 ) .
The partial melting degrees of mantle wedge , lower crust and slab melts to get the highest Cu concentration in melts increase from 3 % , through 6 % to 15 % .
The partial melting mantle wedge , lower crust and slab melts to get the highest Cu concentration in melts increase from 3 % , through 6 % to 15 % .

The partial melting slab melts to get the highest Cu concentration in melts increase from 3 % , through 6 % to 15 % .
The solubility of hydrothermal fluids in magmas increases strongly with increasing pressure .
The Cu concentration of the magma source can be constructed as : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Where is the Cu partition coefficient between fluid and melt ; , and are the Cu concentration of magma source , primitive fluid and the equilibrium melt , respectively ; and are the proportion of primitive fluid and melt , respectively .
The Cu concentrations in hydrothermal fluids ranges from 3000 ppm to over several weight percent ( Audetat et al . , 2008 ) .
The Cu concentrations in fluids is controlled by that of the magma source .
The high Ce anomaly ( average of 360 ) , and consequently high inferred Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios ( average of 550 ) and fO 2 ( range from ΔFMQ + 0 . 7 to ΔFMQ + 1 . 9 ) of Middle Jurassic zircons suggest that the Dexing porphyry was derived from partial melting of the Jurassic oceanic slab .
This higher Cu concentration is crucial for porphyry mineralization .
As a parental magma of the mineralized porphyry , it was recently proposed that the Cu concentration is not a key factor for the Cu mineralization ( Chelle - Michou et al . , 2017 ) .
Many epithermal deposits may indeed form purely through hydrothermal process , but this is not the case for porphyry deposits .
5 The Dexing ore cluster consists of Dexing porphyry Cu deposits , Yinshan epithermal Pb - Zn deposit and , probably also the Jinshan hydrothermal Au deposit .
Three mineralized Dexing porphyries corresponding to three mines , Tongchang , Fujiawu and Zhushahong ( Fig . 1C ) , intruded into the Neoproterozoic ( 800 - 880 Ma ) Shuangqiaoshan Group phyllite rocks ( Wang et al . , 2013b ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) .

In the Phanerozoic , the South China block experienced large scale compression and deformation ( Wang et al . , 2013c ; Zhang et al . , 2013a ) .
Note , young oceanic crust and mid ocean ridges do not have many sediments that can be subducted .
During partial melting , sulfur under saturation in the melt ( Jugo et al . , 2005b ; Jugo et al . , 2010 ) induces sulfide consumption ( see Supplementary Material ) .
As the Cu abundance in the lower continental crust is less than 30 ppm , melts of this source would have Cu content less than 75 ppm , which is four times less than that of the slab melting condition .
Normal arc rocks can rarely form any porphyry Cu deposits , no matter how oxidized it is ( Sun et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2016 ) .
In most igneous systems , copper partitions preferentially into sulfides over silicate melts , in the presence of sulfides ( Kiseeva and Wood , 2013 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ) .
For the subducted MORB partial melting , the mineral assemblage of 37 . 2 % garnet , 58 . 1 % amphibole , 4 . 6 % clinopyroxene , 0 . 1 % Ti - magnetite ( weight proportion ( Xiong et al . , 2005 ) ) are left as residues .
Because copper strongly partitions into sulfides , the influence of sulfide ( the sulfur assumed as the form of FeS in the melt for the calculating simplification ) is considered for the Cu estimation following the accumulated fractional melting method .
Although sediments play an important role in the arc magmatism ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Plank , 2005 ; Plank and Langmuir , 1998 ) , subducted sediments is not a major component in adakites derived from slab melting .
Although partition coefficient of Cu between sulfide and silicate melt varies with many factors like melt compositions , fO 2 , fS 2 , and temperature ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Wood , 2013 , 2015 ; Li , 2014 ; Li and Audetat , 2012 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Zajacz et al . , 2013 ) , all the results so far published are very high ( 800 - 1400 ) .
The three mineralized porphyries in the Dexing deposit are granodiorite stocks mainly consisting of plagioclase , quartz , K - feldspar , amphibole and biotite , with magnetite , apatite , titanite , ilmenite and zircon as accessory minerals .
The lower Cu content in the more reduced melting environment is due to the dilution of Cu in a greater mass of melt .
To form a porphyry Cu deposit ( with an average grade of 0 . 4 - 1 wt % ) , the volume of a source magmas with a Cu content of 75 ppm must be ~ 60 to ~ 150 times larger than the orebody , assuming 90 % of the Cu and Au went into ore - forming fluids and enriched in the ore body .
To form a mineralized porphyry , the Cu concentration of the magma source must be higher than 160 ppm .
Given that high Sr / Y characteristics may also be produced during partial melting of thickened continental crust or other processes ( Atherton and Petford , 1993 ; Chung et al . , 2003 ; Kay , 1993 , 2002 ; Ma et al . , 2015 ; Qian and Hermann , 2013 ; Rapp et al . , 2003 ; Xiong et al . , 2006 ) , magmas with adakitic geochemical signatures but formed by processes other than slab melting are termed as adakitic or adakite - like by Castillo ( 2012 ) .
The special geochemical signature of porphyry magma ( like high Sr / Y and La / Yb raitos ) makes it essential to reiterate melts ' compositions and behavior of sulfides at these fO 2 conditions .

To form the adakitic signature , over 40 % to > 80 % partial melting of the lower continental crust is required ( Fig . 6 C and D ) .
In general , high oxygen fugacity in the source of the porphyry magma are mostly related to plate subduction .
In general , hydrothermal activity may enrich ore forming elements by factors of tens up to hundreds times .
In general , hydrothermal activity may enrich ore elements by factors of tens up to hundreds times .
Instead , the high fO 2 ( ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) of these magmas is a primary feature of the latest magmatism .
In contrast , slab melts ( 390 ppm Cu ) have Cu concentrations 5 times higher than the lower crust melts ( < 75 ppm Cu ) , the source magma volume and cross - section area of the feeding zone could be reduced to 20 percent , which may reach economic levels in case conditions are optimized .
However , the west Pacific oceanic crust is older and thus wetter than the east Pacific , but there is no porphyry Cu deposit in the Japan arc , whereas about half of the porphyry Cu deposits are distributed in the eastern Pacific arcs ( Sun et al . , 2012b ) .
The estimated zircon oxygen fugacities of porphyry Cu deposits in the world with various tonnage ( from 95 Mt in El Teniente to 1 . 5 Mt in Shaxi ) are high ( ~ ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 on average ) .
The estimated oxygen fugacity reflected by zircons from Dexing porphyry Cu deposit indicates that the oxidized characteristics of porphyry magma are primary characteristics of the magmas parental to the porphyry Cu deposit .
Moreover , the lower continental crust is much drier ( H 2 O content is mostly lower than 1000 ppm ( Xia et al . , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 2008a ; Yang et al . , 2008b ) ) , such that is not a favorable source for the formation of porphyry magmas that could then evolve to produce porphyry Cu deposit .
This is because mantle peridotite has low Cu and S contents .
The fertility of oxidized porphyry magmas is generally attributed to the chalcophile characteristic of Cu , which is controlled by sulfide stability and therefore by oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2013 ) .
Similarly , both slab melting ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) and partial melting of thickened lower crust ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2015 ; Asadi et al . , 2014 ; Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009a ; Chiaradia et al . , 2009b ; Hou et al . , 2015 ) have been proposed for porphyry mineralization .
In other words , partial melting of subducted oceanic slab is a good candidate for the source of magmas parental to porphyry Cu deposits .
On the contrary , reduced magmas may become sulfide saturated during evolution in deep magma chambers ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Li , 2014 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) , leading to Cu depletion before emplacement of these magmas at higher levels in the crust .
These end up with Cu content of 160 ppm in the magma source as the lower limit required for primitive mineralization fluid ( 3000 ppm Cu ) .
For this reason , metasomatised mantle wedge with sulfide cumulates was proposed as the source of Cu and S in porphyry Cu deposit ( Hou et al . , 2015 ; Lee , 2014 ) .
This goes back to slab melting for Cu enrichment , anyway , which emphasizes the necessity of the subducted oceanic slab .
Geological settings The Dexing porphyry Cu deposit is located in the eastern Jiangnan Orogen , a Neoproterozoic suture .
More importantly , partial melting of metasomatised mantle wedge cannot form the high Sr / Y , La / Yb signature of porphyry Cu deposits .
More importantly , partial melting of metasomatised mantle wedge cannot form the high Sr / Y signature of porphyry Cu deposits .
More importantly , partial melting of metasomatised mantle wedge cannot form the high La / Yb signature of porphyry Cu deposits .
As mentioned above , porphyry Cu deposits usually form at depths of 2 - 4 km ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , whereas the solubility of water increases with increasing pressure .
Following a study on sulfur budget in magmas ( Wallace and Edmonds , 2011 ) , the sulfur concentration in the source is set as 1000 ppm for a slab dominated by MORB , and the initial Cu concentration of the MORB is set as 80 ppm ( White and Klein , 2014 ) .
The common feature of magmas from the three origins is that the Cu content of the aggregated melt increases to a maximum , then decreases , with the partial melting degree .
In contrast , neither lower crust melts ( < 75 ppm Cu ) nor arc magma derived from mantle wedge ( < 150 ppm Cu ) is suitable for porphyry deposits .
Although the origin of Cu mineralized porphyry magma is still in debate ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Oyarzun et al . , 2001 ; Richards , 2009Richards , , 2013Sun et al . , 2010 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , most parental magmas of porphyry possess high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , which are also important characteristics for adakite and adakitic magmas .

The higher the initial sulfur concentration of the system , the greater partial melting degree as well as oxidizing conditions is needed for consuming all the sulfur in the residual assemblages .
As in Fig . 7 , in the mantle wedge partial melting model , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 may indeed form melts with high initial Cu only if the degree of partial melting is very low ( ~ 3 % ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , which cannot form arc magmas .
Alternatively , if the mantle wedge is metasomatised by Cu - rich adakite , it may also have Cu contents higher than normal arc , but lower than adakite .
Our modeling shows that partial melting of subducted oceanic crust , under oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 , is favorable for producing primary magmas with Cu contents sufficiently high for porphyry mineralization , which plausibly explains the close relationship between porphyry Cu deposits and oxidized magmas with adakitic affinities .

It has been argued that high oxygen fugacity of the porphyry source may also be inherited from previous subduction modified materials ( Wang et al . , 2014a ) , e . g .
To estimate the minimum Cu concentration in the magma source of the mineralized porphyry , the highest the partition coefficient and lowest fluid proportion are used .
The lack of oxidation in Neoproterozoic and no other plate subduction event before the Middle Jurassic in this area leaves Jurassic plate subduction the only candidate responsible for the high oxygen fugacity of the Dexing porphyry magma .
In summary , the initial Cu content is an important parameter and slab melts is the best candidate for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) .
From equation ( 2 ) , the Cu concentration in primitive fluid increases with that of the magma source .
To trace the origin of the high oxygen fugacity in porphyry Cu deposits , we determined trace element compositions and U - Pb ages of magmatic and inherited zircon from Dexing porphyry Cu deposit , calculated Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + of zircons and estimated the oxygen fugacity of their parental magmas .
This is also suggested as a flat subduction event ( Li and Li , 2007 ; Zhou and Li , 2000 ) .
In another word , could the lower crust melt with Cu content as low as 75 ppm be a possible source ?
In this scenario , 5 - 30 % partial melting of subducted slab under an oxygen fugacity higher than FMQ + 1 . 5 produces melts with high Cu ( 390 ppm ) , Sr / Y and La / Yb , features that are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .

In general , the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements is controlled by sulfide , while the sulfur speciation is controlled by oxygen fugacity .
Under high oxygen fugacity , sulfate is the stable phase ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , which allows release of Cu into the melt during melting , and allows chalcophile metals to be extracted into silicate melts and fluids ( Kiseeva and Wood , 2013 ; Ripley et al . , 2002 ) .

The Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios of Middle Jurassic ( ~ 170 Ma ) magmatic zircons are high ( 550 on average ) , whereas the Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratios of inherited zircons ( 200 - 880 Ma ) are much lower ( 263 on average ) .

Previous authors proposed that subducted sediments was the major components for Dexing adaktie based on Pb isotope ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) .
The partition coefficients of silicate minerals in the magma evolution process are average values from Liu et al . ( 2015 ) ( Table S5 ) .
Therefore , the efficiency of Cu enrichment through hydrothermal activities is much lower than a shallow arc magma system , and thus the volume of source magmas needed should be further doubled .
We also modeled the effects of oxygen fugacity on partial melting of oceanic crust , lower crust and mantle peridotite for Cu .

We also modeled the effects of oxygen fugacity on partial melting lower crust and mantle peridotite for Cu .
We also modeled the effects of oxygen fugacity on partial melting mantle peridotite for Cu .
One major debate is whether the high oxygen fugacity of the magma was inherited from Neoproterozoic convergent margin magmas ( Hou et al . , 2013 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) or formed during the porphyry magmatism in the Jurassic ( Zhang et al . , 2013b ) .
This strongly suggest that the high oxygen characteristic of Dexing porphyry deposit was formed in the Jurassic , but not inherited from Neoproterozoic .
Because of the various origin of porphyry magma , we compared melting of subducted MORB crust , lower continental crust and mantle peridotite , using the modeling method similar to that of Lee et al . ( 2012 ) .
It , therefore , was argued that normal arc rocks may form porphyry Cu deposits through addition of water ( Richards , 2011 ) .
Among the possible origins of the porphyry magma , the slab melt is much higher than melts derived from either the lower crust or the mantle wedge .
It is even reported that the most primitive magmatic fluid of the porphyry Cu deposit contains ~ 10 wt % Cu ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) .
Therefore , conditions imposed by Neoproterozoic subduction was not responsible for the formation of the Dexing porphyry deposit .
The relationship suggests that the Dexing porphyry magma was highly oxidized when the Jurassic magmatic zircons crystallized ( estimated fO 2 : ΔFMQ + 0 . 7 ( ± 1 . 3 ) - ΔFMQ + 1 . 9 ( ± 1 . 3 ) ) , which cannot be attributed to partial melting of the Neoproterozoic arc crust ( estimated fO 2 : ΔFMQ - 2 . 4 ( ± 1 . 1 ) - ΔFMQ + 0 . 7 ( ± 1 . 2 ) ) as proposed previously .

Then , from 830 Ma to 745 Ma , the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks amalgamated , followed by rifting ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ) .

Previous modeling results show that partial melting of mantle peridotite under high oxygen fugacity ( even at > ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) cannot form Cu - rich magmas , which plausibly explains the lack of porphyry 3 Cu deposits in normal arc rocks .

This is also related to whether the adakitic characteristics ( high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratio ) of Dexing porphyry magma was derived from partial melting of subducted oceanic crust or thickened lower continental crust .

On the contrary , the same degree of lower crust partial melting leads to a much higher Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ( Fig .

Previous studies also suggested that partial melting of mantle peridotite under different oxygen fugacities is not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Then , what is the lower limit of the Cu concentration in the magma source for porphyry mineralization .
As shown in this study , although the high H 2 O condition has some impact on the porphyry mineralization , it is normal for all rocks at convergent margins .
Similar to the low fO 2 condition , the Cu concentration of the melt derived from a S - rich reservoir would be diluted by the large degree of accumulated partial melting ( Sun et al . , 2016 ) .
As discussed above , about 40 % to 90 % partial melting of typical lower crust tends to form magmas with very low Cu ( < 75 ppm , Fig . 7 ) .
Under the influence of oxygen fugacity , melts from diverse reservoirs discussed above have a large Cu concentration variation with highest values in slab melts ( 390 ppm ) and lowest values in lower crust melts ( < 75 ppm ) .
The first order observation is that most porphyry Cu deposits are located at convergent margins and are closely associated with oxidized adakite .
This makes it very difficult channelize the ore - forming fluids to the orebody efficiently .
Under high oxygen fugacity ( ~ FMQ + 1 . 5 ) , sulfur is present mainly as sulfate in the melt , which promotes Cu enrichments .
To form the Sr / Y and La / Yb signature of a porphyry system through melting of the lower continental crust , more than 40 % partial melting is needed .
In contrast , large degrees ( up to 90 % ) of partial melting of the lower continental crust is necessary to produce magmas with high Sr / Y and La / Yb magmas , and these magmas would have low Cu content ( < 75 ppm ) even under a high oxygen fugacity and there would be an unsuitable source for producing porphyry Cu deposits .
In contrast , large degrees ( up to 90 % ) of partial melting of the lower continental crust is necessary to produce magmas with high Sr / Y magmas , and these magmas would have low Cu content ( < 75 ppm ) even under a high oxygen fugacity and there would be an unsuitable source for producing porphyry Cu deposits .

Under high oxygen fugacity ( ~ ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 ) , slab melts contain the highest Cu concentration ( ~ 400 ppm ) , then the mantle wedge melts ( ~ 350 ppm ) and lower crust melts ( ~ 220 ppm ) , which is correlated to the initial Cu composition of each reservoir .
At over 20 - 30 % partial melting degree of the mantle wedge as suggested for most arc rocks ( Mallik et al . , 2016 ; Mann and Schmidt , 2015 ; Mitchell and Grove , 2015 ) , the Cu concentration of the melt is less than 150 ppm .
Sample preparation and trace element analysis of zircon Fresh granodiorite samples collected from Tongchang and Fujiawu mines ( Fig . 1C ) were crushed to ~ 6 for trace element and U - Pb isotopic measurements , which were obtained using laser ablation inductively - coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA - ICPMS ) at the Guangzhou Institute of 7 3 .

This suggests that ΔFMQ + 1 . 5 is a threshold of porphyry deposit , which forms Cu rich magmas ( Fig . 7 ) .
Combined with the Sr / Y and La / Yb estimation from slab and lower crust partial melts , 5 - 30 % partial melting degree to produce the adakitic signature is consistent with the Cu enrichment in slab melting model .

The results of our model illustrate the importance of fO 2 in the source of the parental magmas of mineralized porphyries ( Fig . 7 ) .
The original purpose of this section is to estimate the Cu enrichment of the partial melts derived from different models under various oxygen fugacities .
This raises the question of how to testify when and how a mineralized porphyry magma becomes oxidized , which is essential to decipher the key factors that controls Cu enrichment .
Note that only 6 - 8 km vertical extent are available for source magmas to feed the porphyry system , because the depth of supplying zone in the magma chamber is less than 10 km .
Although there are different models for the magmatism of the Jiangnan Orogen in the Neoproterozoic ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ) , it is generally accepted that the Jiangnan Orogen experienced subduction , before 830 Ma ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) up to even > 900 Ma ( Li et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Zheng et al . , 2008 ) .
In the accumulated fractional melting model of this study , the melt increment ( 0 . 01 % ) instantaneously extracts from the system and equilibrates with the mineral assemblage residues , then aggregates to form accumulated melts .
This argument denies the effect of high oxygen fugacity but tends to a sense that any magma source is possible for a mineralized porphyry magma .
The Ce N / Ce N * , Ce / Nd ratios , and inferred Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + and fO 2 of inherited Neoproterozoic zircons show a systematically reduced environment compared to that of the Jurassic magmatic zircons that crystallized directly from the Dexing porphyry magma ( Fig . 3 and 5 ) .
The Cu composition apex in the model represents the exhausting of sulfides , after which Cu becomes an incompatible element and it partitions into the partial melts more efficiently .
In the accumulated fractional melting model , the selection of residual mineral assemblages in equilibrium with melts derived from subducted MORB or lower crust were based on experimental studies .
Remarkably , there isn ' t an obvious correlation between the Cu reserve and oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that the fO 2 of FMQ + 1 . 5 is the threshold for Cu enrichment in melts ( Fig . 7 ) , whereas the tonnage depends also on many other factors , e . g . , the amount of slab melts , the efficiency of hydrothermal enrichment , the geologic settings that enable the storage , preservation and exposure of the porphyry deposits , etc .
Cenozoic ridge subduction and the resultant slab windows have been well documented worldwide , especially along the western margins of North and South America .
Adakitic melts tend to be generated close to the hot plate margins , whereas A - type granites and porphyry Cu - Au deposits form in the center of the opening slab window .
Adakitic melts tend to be generated close to the hot plate margins , whereas A - type granites and porphyry Cu - Au deposits form in the center opening slab window .
Ridge subduction ( or ridge - trench interaction ) is one of the most recent additions to the panoply of key constraints of the plate tectonic paradigm ( DeLong et al . , 1979 ; Thorkelson , 1996 ; Santosh and Kusky , 2009 ) .
Many adakitic and granitic rocks have been described in the slab window of West Junggar , and we know there are relevant hydrothermal vent Cu - Au deposits in West Junngar , but so far no symmetrical zonation of the deposits has been defined , which would help to confirm and constrain the slab window .

Note that the adakites are only along the margin of the slab window .
If the basal MOR basalts are missing ( due to offscraping during accretion ) , the presence of basal pelagic cherts and ridge limestones is still sufficiently indicative of subduction of the whole ocean floor and its generative mid - oceanic ridge .
Other important features of ridge subduction are high - temperature metamorphism closely associated with near - trench plutons created by 2 heat released through a slab window , and porphyry gold - copper - zinc mineralization associated with MOR ophiolites and generated in hydrothermal vents at a MOR .
This survey shows that the CAOB contains many examples of ridge subduction and slab windows primarily in West Junggar and the Chinese Altai , and less commonly in East Junggar , Beishan , the Tianshan , Kyrgyzstan , the Russian Altai , Inner Mongolia and Alxa .
The key magmatic products are adakites that include plutonic and volcanic rocks with intermediate - to high - SiO2 , high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios , elevated MgO , Na2O , K2O , Ni hornblende / biotite - bearing high - Mg diorites , and granodiorites to hornblende / pyroxene and Cr contents , and high LILE and LREE elements .

When a ridge subducts under a continental margin , the diverging plates associated with the ridge continue to separate creating a slab window that forms between the separating plates .
The principal characteristics of ridge subduction , which can be used to recognize the process in ancient orogens , include intrusion of ridge - generated magmas into a forearc in a near - trench position ; this can be regarded as the hallmark of ridge subduction .
One generation was orthogonal to an ophiolite - strewn paleotrench ( suture ) , and the second was parallel to a transform fault that was parallel to the paleo - trench .
These occurrences are all located in Paleozoic rocks of the southern CAOB , so there is still much scope for discoveries in the northern part .
The geological effects and features of ridge subduction were well summarized by e . g .
Examples of these relations within the CAOB are seen in the accreted , low - grade OPS in Mongolia ( Kurihara et al . , 2009 ; Safonova , 2009 ; Safonova et al . 2015 ) , the ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
It is important to note that most studies of ridge subduction in the CAOB have reported mostly geochemical and geochronological data , but without much matching structural data .
When a ridge approaches a trench and eventually subducts beneath it , it may lead to hot asthenosphere beneath the forearc , generating mixed metasomatized crust - mantle and associated HT / UHT metamorphism .
When pelagic sediments underlain by basalts from a mid - oceanic ridge ( Ocean Plate Stratigraphy ) are accreted , they will be subducted to variable depths from the greenschist to the granulite and eclogite facies .
Triple - junction interactions with emphasis on the subduction of a migrating ridge ( modified after Sisson and Pavlis , 1993 ; Thorkelson , 1996 ; Li et al . , 2015 ) .
With such information , we could then ask whether the ridge subduction kinematics in the southern CAOB differed from those farther north .
However , the geochemical parameters of the majority of ophiolites in the world today suggest generation in supra - subduction zone environments , and therefore it must be clear that the ophiolites do have mid - ocean ridge chemistry of N - MORB .
When an ocean opens and closes , it is inevitable that a mid - oceanic ridge ( Searle , 2013 ) will travel with its pelagic sediments on it across the ocean to a trench where it may be accreted and / or subducted , giving rise to a unique geodynamic and geochemical environment ( DeLong and Fox , 1977 ) .
All these processes will enable the full contribution of ridge subduction and slab window formation to be better understood in the CAOB .
However , these are early days , because most parts of the CAOB have yet to be investigated for evidence of ridge subduction and slab windows , so the prospects are high .
However , only structural data will enable definition of the responsible suture zone and plate boundary , and the outlines of a possible slab window .
Finally , we suggest that more attention should be paid to the processes of deep ridge subduction .
The dikes provide the best evidence so far for the orientation and opening of a slab window in the CAOB , and for the relative movement directions of the downgoing and overriding plates during the subduction and closure of swarms of late Carboniferous high - Mg hornblende - biotite diorite dykes with sanukitoid the Paleo - Asian Ocean .

Most of the above features have been described and analyzed in many parts of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB ) , particularly in West Junggar , Chinese Altai , Russian Altai , East Junggar , Beishan , Chinese Tianshan , Inner Mongolia , Kyrgyzstan , and at Alxa .
The trace element chemistry of these rocks demonstrates that they were generated by partial melting of dehydrated subducted oceanic crust and of lower continental crust , contaminated and metasomatized by juvenile melts that originated by upwelling of asthenospheric mantle .
They are typically associated with a wide variety of coeval and compositionally diverse volcanic and plutonic rocks such as high - Ca boninites , tholeiitic , high - T basalts , alkaline basalts , charnockites , peraluminous TTGs , I - type granites , and mid - ocean ridge ( MOR ) ( not supra - subduction ) ophiolites .

Although the idea that a spreading ridge must ultimately interact with an active trench leading to ridge subduction was first proposed by DeLong and Fox ( 1977 ) , it took more than a decade before the idea became popular .
The purpose of this paper is to describe the features of ridge subduction and slab windows within the Neoproterozoic - Paleozoic Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB ) , in order to evaluate the role of ridge subduction during the long development of this major accretionary orogen .
There are several unique or diagnostic features that can individually be used to define unambiguously a ridge subduction event , but a combination of multiple indicators and the resultant features , outlined below , will lead to a more robust assessment .
Prominent in one of two slab windows defined in West Junggar are two chemistry that intruded through the slab window .
So , we recommend that future research in this direction produces more structural information in and around the ridge subduction rocks .
It is this combination of mixed sources that gives rise to the diagnostic and distinctive features of coeval and associated ridge subduction rocks in a near - trench environment .
We suggest that all these areas in the CAOB require re - evaluation in order to better understand the probable role of ridge subduction in their formation .
Thus , the presence in accretionary or collisional orogens of OPS floored by MOR basalts provides another major indicator of ridge subduction .
Nevertheless , many papers were written in early years ( and some even recently ) about inter - related , and often coeval , magmatic rocks in the CAOB like high - Mg adakites , andesites and diorites ; shoshonites and boninites ; Nb - enriched basalts and high - K granites ; porphyry - CuAu mineralization , mixed metasomatized crust - mantle parentage , and associated HT / UHT metamorphism , which are all similar to those associated with modern ridge subduction .
Without knowledge of the concept of ridge - trench interaction at the time , most of these rocks were alternatively ascribed to processes such as slab breakoff , post - collisional extension , or slab roll - back ( Han et al . , 1997 ; Niu et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jahn et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Cai et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Ma et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al , 2016 ; Liu et al . 2017 ; Yin et al . , 2017 ) .
As pointed out by Bradley et al . ( 1993 ; 2003 ) and Kusky et al . ( 1997 ; 2003 ) , the diachroneity of these features along strike is very important to identify ridge subduction .
Maps of geochemical signatures are efficient evidence layers for integration with other exploration evidence layers in mineral prospectivity mapping ( MPM ) of certain types of deposits ( e . g . , Agterberg , 1992 ; Agterberg and Bonham - Carter , 2005 ; Carranza , 2008Carranza , , 2011Lusty et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ; Carranza , 2015 ; Carranza and Laborte , 2015a , b ; Yousefi and Carranza , 2016 ) .
Sample catchment basin modeling increases the prediction rate of mineral deposits as well .
2 - Mineral prospectivity models are affected by applied methods for geochemical anomaly modeling .
3 - Prediction - area ( P–A ) plot and the plot of success - rate curve with a gauge line ( Nd = 1 ) are powerful tools to recognize significant multi - element geochemical signatures .
Thus , effective and ineffective indicator geochemical signatures for exploration of a certain deposit - type are recognized .
We applied SCB and contour mapping methods to model anomalies .
Modeling of geochemical anomalies especially in stream sediment data is another challenging issue because the materials of each stream sample have upstream sources ( Spadoni , 2006 ; Carranza , 2008 ) .
Recognizing geochemical anomalies and modeling their spatial associations with particular 9 geological features are critical aspects for mineral exploration and understanding ore geometry ( Ziaii et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) .
Thus , certain indicator elements ( or multi - element signatures ) cannot be used efficiently in different areas because the dispersion patterns of indicator elements are affected by characteristics of the study area .
For recognizing geochemical signatures related to a certain deposit - type sought , factor analysis ( as a multivariate analysis method ) has been used ( e . g . , Reimann et al . , 2002 ; Kumru and Bakac , 2003 ; Helvoort et al . , 2005 ; El - Makky , 2011 ; He et al . , 2013 ; Sadeghi et al . , 2015 ) .
For selecting a stronger geochemical evidence layer of the deposit - type sought in the study area , we compared the results of integration of both SCB model and contour map with another geological evidence layer in MPM .
In this regard , multi - element associations of Zn - Pb , As - Sb , and Au - Ag - Cu - Mo have been used as indicators for prospecting porphyry - Cu deposits in different areas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Weixuan et al . , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ; Yousefi et al . , 2012 ) , but in the study area the Zn - Pb and As - Sb associations have not shown positive spatial association with the deposit - type sought , and so , they are not significant geochemical signatures for the deposit .

In this regard , receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) analysis ( Swets , 1988 ) and success rate curves ( Chung and Fabbri , 2003 ; Agterberg and Bonham - Carter , 2005 ) could be employed to assess the ability of evidence layers or geochemical signatures in predicting mineral deposits ( e . g . , Carranza , 2008 ; Nykänen et al . , 2014 ; Andrada de Palomera et al . , 2014 ; Carranza and Laborte , 2015c ) .
The efficiency of mineral prospectivity models and the reliability of delimited target areas could be enhanced by recognizing of efficient and inefficient indicators and exclusion of inefficient indicators from the process of target generation in MPM ( Yousefi and Carranza , 2015a , b ; Parsa et al . , 2016 ) .
For this , we used staged factor analysis proposed by Yousefi et al . ( 2012Yousefi et al . ( , 2014 with robust estimation of covariance matrix ( Pison et al . , 2003 ; Filzmoser et al . , 2009b ) .
Then , to recognize significant geochemical signatures of the deposit - type sought and evaluate the anomaly mapping methods , we adapted prediction - area ( P - A ) plot , normalized density , and success rate curve .
On the other hand , geochemical signature of GMPI Au - Ag - Cu - Mo shows proximal halos to the outcropping mineralized zones ( Figs . 3 , 6 ) .
In this paper we used P - A plot ( Yousefi and Carranza , 2015b ) in conjunction with a success rate curve with a gauge line ( Nd = 1 and We = 0 ) ( Parsa et al . , 2016 ) to evaluate different geochemical signatures , and consequently to discriminate efficient and inefficient signatures of the deposit - type sought .
Factor analysis reveals element associations that genetically present in the mineral deposits of the type sought ( e . g . , Sadeghi et al . , 2013 ; He et al . , 2014 ) .
In this regard , because element associations are affected by the diversity of geological characteristics of different areas , it is important to analyze and recognize significant geochemical signatures that represent the deposit - type sought .
This shows that these two groups of elements ( Au - Ag - Cu - Mo and Pb - Zn ) have different dispersion patterns ( Figs . 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) .
Recognition of significant mineralization - related multi - element geochemical signatures is a challenge , because factor analysis may reveals more than one multi - element association ( i . e . , factors ) representing the same deposit of the type sought .
This study aims to recognize significant multi - element geochemical signatures and map geochemical anomalies associated with porphyry - Cu deposits to delineate target areas for further exploration in the Noghdouz area , northwestern Iran .

Concluding remarks 1 - Recognizing significant multi - element geochemical signatures of a mineral deposit of the type sought in an area is important because despite the presence of generally common indicator elements that are genetically related to the mineralization , the dispersion pattern of indicator elements in different areas can differ .
In preliminary exploration stages , stream sediment geochemical data are generally used to delineate anomalous areas ( e . g . , Carranza and Hale , 1997 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Zuo et al . , 2009 ; Bai et al . , 2010 ; Carranza , 2011 ; Zuo , 2011b ; El - Makky and Sediek , 2012 ; Zheng et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ; Wang and Zuo , 2015 ) .
As demonstrated in this paper , the Au - Ag - Cu - Mo association is a strong geochemical signature for the deposit - type sought .
There are various factors that affect dispersion patterns of geochemical elements in different areas ( Spadoni , 2006 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Yousefi et al . , 2013 ) .
In this paper , exploring the effects of mapping methods of geochemical anomalies in predict ion of mineral deposits and delimiting the study area show that SCB model is more efficient than contour maps for target generation , especially for MPM .
Considering the results of the second stage of RFA ( Table 1 ) , the first factor shows Au - Ag - Cu - Mo enrichment and Pb - Zn depletion ( cf .
Thus , it is important to analyze and recognize significant geochemical signatures representing the deposit - type sought in a study area for further exploration ( e . g . , Andrada de Palomera et al . , 2012 ; Yousefi and Nykänen , 2015 ; Parsa et al . , 2016 ) .
By using these processes , we recognized the best geochemical signature of the deposit - type sought in the study area .
In this regard , based on the results of this paper sample catchment basin modeling of geochemical anomalies result in more reliable target areas for further exploration in comparison with contour maps .
They can be applied efficiently to evaluate and rank maps of geochemical signatures .
For this , we used factor analysis and two modeling methods of geochemical anomalies , sample catchment basin and contour map .
In this regard , several methods have been proposed for mapping stream sediment geochemical signatures including point symbol maps , contour mapping or interpolation approaches ( Howarth , 1983 ) , sample catchment basins ( SCB ) ( Bonham - Carter andGoodfellow , 1984 , 1986 ; Bonham - Carter , 1994 ; Carranza and Hale , 1997 ; Moon , 1999 ; Spadoni et al . , 2004 ; Carranza , 2008 ; Carranza , 2010b ) , stream orders ( Carranza , 2004 ) , extended sample catchment basins ( Spadoni , 2006 ) and weighted drainage catchment basins ( Yousefi et al . , 2013 ) .
Various studies have applied contour mapping and SCB for modeling geochemical anomalies using stream sediment data ( e . g . , Hawkes , 1976 ; Bonham - Carter et al . , 1987 , 1988Carranza , 2004Carranza , , 2008Carranza , , 2010a .
On the other hand , factor analysis may reveals some factors in the chemical composition of stream sediment data that are not genetically related to the deposit - type sought ( Yilmaz , 2003 ; Spadoni , 2006 ; Cheng , 2007 ; Zuo et al . , 2009 ; Xie et al . , 2010 ; Yousefi et al . , 2012 ) .
In addition , stream sediment data are irregularly sampled , and thus contour mapping of geochemical anomalies is not the best choice for modeling the spatial distribution of stream sediment data .
Diversity and complexity of geological processes in different areas result in dif ferent element associations for prospecting a certain mineral deposit - type sought .
This surficial zoning pattern is analogous to those reported from several known porphyry - Cu systems ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , and thus , the delimited targets in the study area should be evaluated for further explorations .
The proposed methods in this paper can efficiently be used in other areas to recognize significant geochemical signatures of different types of mineral deposits .
This is due to the smoothing effect of ordinary moving average contour mapping methods ( e . g . , IDW ) that adversely affects the modeling of geochemical anomalies of stream sediment data ( Zuo , 2011b ) by neglecting locally high values .
