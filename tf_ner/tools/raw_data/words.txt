Continental China is a mosaic of numerous tectonic blocks , which amalgamated from Neoarchean through Cenozoic broadly coeval with the cycles of global supercontinents such as Kenorland , Columbia , Rodinia , Gondwana , and Pangaea .
Superimposed orogeny has reworked the lithospheric structure with concomitant granitoid - associated metallogeny .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .
The stratiform ore deposit , including BIF , VMS , and SEDEX , or sedimentary sulfide layers formed from Neoarchean to Paleozoic were modified by later mineralization , resulting in the enrichment of the various metal species and enhancement of ore resources .
The composite metallogenic system was dominantly characterized by the multi - episodic and diverse mineralization concomitant with one or more features including mineralization evolved from the previous metal enrichment , later overlap of ore deposit , and diversifying of metal species derived from 2 GR Focus Review reworked lithosphere .
Continental China is located at the junction of the Central Asian orogenic belt , Tethyan orogenic belt and the oceanic subduction zone of the Pacific plate ( Ren et al . , 2013 ; ) ( Fig . 1a ) . China is a collage of cratons and fragmental continental blocks and arcs , welded by multiple ophiolitic mélange .

The NE China microcontinental Block was affected by the Mongol - Okhotsk suture ( Fig . 1 ) to the north and the Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) to the south in Permo - Triassic ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Mongol - Okhotsk suture stretches along the southeastern boundary of the Siberian Craton over 3000 km , extending from the present - day Udsky gulf of the Okhotsk Sea to the Khangay mountain range in Central Mongolia ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) .

Jurassic to Cretaceous subduction system
The Jurassic to Cenozoic subduction systems are developed both along southwestern and eastern margins of China .
Southward oceanic subduction of the Bangong - Nujiang Ocean from the Permian to the Early Cretaceous gave rise to extensive calc - alkaline magmatism on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Zhang et al . , 2012b ) .

A series of near NS - striking normal fault systems mark the east - west extension ( Coleman and Hodges , 1995 ; Blisniuk et al . , 2001 ) .
These parallel faults resulted in the development of a series of grabens or rifts , which constrain the localization of potassic felsic intrusions associated with Cu mineralization .

The superimposed orogenesis , including the superimposing between different episodes of accretionary orogeny , collisional orogeny , mantle plume , and demantling can be summarized into the following categories : ( 1 ) continental collision superimposed on the pre - Cenozoic accretionary orogeny in the Tibet ( Fig . 12 ) and Sanjiang ( Fig . 14 ; and ( 5 ) mantle plume rising through metasomatized lithospheric mantle or stagnant oceanic slab in the Emeishan large igneous province as described in section 2 . 4 ( Bai et al . , 2014 ) .
and Pacific plate subduction ( e . g . , Sun et al . , 2007 ) , and mainly developed on the Paleoproterozoic suture ( Li et al . , 2012a ; Deng and Wang , 2015 ) .

The subduction of the main Paleo - Tethyan oceanic crust and those of its branches generated arc magmatism as well as S - type granitoids ( Figs . stage , after the lithosphere has been thickened , the lithospheric mantle was removed leading to the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism in the northern margin of Tibet and Sanjiang belts during 45 - 30 Ma ( Chung et al . , 2005 ; ) .

The superimposed orogeny in Tibet and Sanjiang is characterized by the spatial overlap between the accretionary orogenesis during the evolution of Tethyan oceans and the Indian - Eurasian continental collision ( Figs . 12 and 14 ) .
The shearing disaggregated the ophiolite forming mélange zone , and the magmatism developed along the Tethyan or even earlier subduction zones developed with subduction - related igneous rocks .
The lithosphere shortening and rotation , as well as lower lithospheric mantle removal , which was considered to have triggered the ( ultra - ) potassic magmatism ( Deng et al . , 2014b ) , has largely reshaped the lithospheric structure .

The metallogenic types in these two types of orogenesis are also different .
The subduction rate is smaller , andesites are generally dominant , and the lithosphere thickens , with a greater contribution to the growth of the continental lithosphere ( Doglioni et al . , 2007 ) .
The ancient sutures between blocks , craton margins , and arcs acted as favorable locations for the production of ore deposit during the later tectonic events ( Fig . 18 ) .

Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Oxygen fugacity is of critical importance for the behaviors of elements .

Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts formed at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 and ΔFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Slab melts formed at ΔFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ΔFMQ 0 ) .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Sulfate reduction
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation during magma chamber development may be better mixed and more homogenized .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

Oxygen fugacity of Manus glasses was calculated using the following equa - ( Kress and Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Hydrogen may further react with CO 2 and / or O 2 ( Eqs .
Pure hydrothermal hematite and specularite can often be determined to have formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , the specularite occurring in late stage veins at Dexing ( Fig . 13 ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .

Reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are : 17 Mile Hill , Western Australia ; the Minãs de San Anton , Mexico ( Rowins , 2000 ) ; the Baogutu , northwestern China ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010aShen et al . , , 2012 ; North Fork Deposit , west Central Cascades , western North America ( Smithson and Rowins , 2005 ) ; Catface ; Vancouver Island , British Columbia ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; and a few other small porphyry deposits ( Rowins , 2000 ) .

Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Ridge subduction forms oxidized adakites by slab melting ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Ling et al . , 2009Ling et al . , , 2013 , followed by reduced A - type granites ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; H . Li et al . , 2012 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1994 ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
crystallizes below 950 °C in silicic calc - alkaline magmas ( Green and Watson , 1982 ) .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Low - salinity vapor shows strong seawater signals , which cannot represent " degassing " fluids .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .

Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .

Magnetite crisis
Fluid extraction , however , is different from degassing , and thus Se provides no constraints on the process .

Oxygen fugacity and open systems
Sulfides formed through sulfate reduction are released into magmatic fluids , where they scavenge chalcophile elements Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Hydrothermal magnetite and even hematite may also form in fluids released from arc volcanic magmas , e . g . , Manus glasses , releasing H + .
Metals can be leached out as far as there is enough water circulation .
Adakite , slab melting , ridge subduction and porphyry Cu deposits
Adakite was initially named for rocks formed through partial melting of subducted young oceanic crust ( b25 Ma , represented by midocean ridge basalt , MORB ) ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Kay , 1978 ) .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Fractional crystallization of garnet and / or amphibole plays no positive role in Cu mineralization , either ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
Adakite formation through slab melting , on the other hand , does favor porphyry Cu mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) .

Adakites are often generated by flat subduction young oceanic crust with associated compressional stress in the upper plate .
Oceanic crust has a much higher Cu abundance ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than the mantle ( 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) or the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Normal arc rocks form by partial melting of peridotite from the mantle wedge .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Alterations
Porphyry deposits have very well developed alteration zones that typically affect several cubic kilometers of rock ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Titley , 1981 ) ( Fig . 30 ) , which is of critical importance to understanding porphyry mineralization processes and improving their exploration .

At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

At higher oxygen fugacity , no residual sulfides can be expected unless there is additional sulfur added from the subducting slab , which in actuality is probably the case .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
In highly oxidized porphyry magmas , sulfate , CO 2 and H 2 O are the dominant species , which are already oxidized and thus cannot reduce sulfate to sulfide , leaving ferrous iron as the only probable reducing agent ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
In magma system , this is better described as oxidation of FeO by sulfate or another oxidant ( Eq .
In fluids , the reactions can be described by Eqs .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .

The S abundance in the primitive mantle is estimated to be about 200 - 250 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , and about 150 ppm in depleted mantle ( Lorand , 1990 ; Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .

For slab melts formed at melting degrees higher than that require for SCSS , they would be undersaturated in sulfide and thus could assimilate more sulfides and chalcophile elements from the surrounding mantle while ascending , depending on the partitioning relationships between melt and residual sulfide in the mantle .

The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The Catface porphyry may have ascended through and interacted with graphite - rich reducing country rock known to exist in the region ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .

The H isotopes of fluid inclusions from Baogutu have very low δD values ( Shen et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , which are much lower than for either magmatic fluids or metamorphic fluids ( Fig . 21 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The systematically lighter H coupled with a slightly lighter O can best be explained by the addition of meteoritic water .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

One carbon atom reduces 4 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .

These porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are almost always attributable to the injection of an oxidized adakitic magma that is saturated with S - and metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas are water rich and oxidized ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
If the magma at Catface was reduced during degassing of SO 3 , there should be compositional zonation in the apatite , which is not the case ( Fig . 20 ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Normal arc melts are not systematically more enriched in Cu than MORB , either ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

A small sulfur - ( N 3 wt . % ) and copper - rich ( N0 . 5 wt . % ) fine - grained igneous rock known as " Porphyry A " stock ( b1 km 3 , 6 . 09 ± 0 . 18 Ma ) ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) has abundant igneous anhydrite , with varied textures ranging from interstitial to poikilitic and corresponding modal abundances from 10 to 20 % , respectively .

Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .
All the sulfate reduction reactions provide S 2 − , which promotes mineralization , forming chalcopyrite ( Eq .

Given that ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization , the highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic high potassium intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .

Instead of primary hematite , magnetite , and sulfate ( e . g . , anhydrite , gypsum ) that are frequently seen in oxidized porphyries , these " reduced " porphyry Cu - Au deposits contain abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and commonly have carbonic - rich ore fluids with substantial proportions of CH 4 , clearly indicating a reducing condition ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Most of the ferric Fe will be transferred into the melt because ferric Fe is more incompatible than ferrous Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .

Because the anhydrite - rich stock is isotopically similar to all the other igneous rocks of the late Miocene deposit ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) formed at a time of regional compressive deformation , it has been proposed that an oxidized parent magma in the large productive magma chamber was undergoing igneous fractionation at that time .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content at sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .

Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .

Formation of reduced porphyry deposits
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Therefore , S - Pb isotopes cannot place any decisive constraints on the role of assimilation in forming the deposit .

In general , porphyry Cu - Mo deposits have FeO contents systematically lower than porphyry Cu , but higher than pure porphyry Mo deposits , with oxygen fugacities also falling between them ( Fig . 8 ) .

The supergiant El Teniente deposit in Chile is the largest porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit in the world , with total reserves of ~ 109 Mt Cu @0 . 92 % , 2 . 5 Mt Mo @ 0 . 02 % and 437 t Au @0 . 035 g / t ( Table 1 ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .
The estimated Cu abundance in the primitive mantle is 30 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , whereas the Cu concentrations in MORB so far published range from 70 to 150 ppm ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) .
In contrast , metals of porphyry Cu deposits are hosted in sulfides , which require low oxygen fugacity for their stabilization during the final stage of mineralization .
In contrast , sulfate reduction in magmas does not change the pH , such that the oxygen fugacity is slightly reduced .

In contrast , reduced magmas usually retain residual sulfides , such that they have low primary Cu contents ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
First , lower Cu and Au contents would first result in lower grade , not necessarily smaller tonnages .
The grades of porphyry Cu and Au deposits associated with reduced magmas are comparable to , if not higher than , those associated with oxidized magmas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rowins , 2000 ) .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

Nevertheless , porphyry deposits are usually mineralized in the whole upper portion of the pluton , whereas interactions with country rocks are generally restricted at the interface , therefore assimilation of reducing sediments is not likely to be a decisive controlling process .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .

Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .

Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Nevertheless , assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries would result in heterogeneous reduction , because reduction is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .

Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
In fact , most Cu should have come from slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , as also should have come the S and Pb , which are present in abundances similar to mantle derived magmas .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Therefore , the parental Catface magmas may have acquired a low fO 2 during their ascent through the crust .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Moreover , most mantle minerals olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Moreover , the crystallization of amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
There are also several ridges ( most of which are aseismic , i . e . , island chains ) on the western Pacific plate ( Fig . 28 ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .

Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large amount of Cu .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the less residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Moreover , some porphyry deposits are apparently associated with reduced magmas at ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Intergrowths of hematite and magnetite ( Fig . 10 ) indicate the oxygen fugacity of Qulong reached the HM buffer .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
In contrast , at oxygen fugacity even only slightly lower , e . g . , ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , the highest Cu contents that can be reached through slab melting is ~ 450 ppm .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Therefore , the reduced Catface porphyry is likely to be a country rock that only hosts the deposit .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .

Based on similar Zn / Fe T ratios of mantle peridotite and primitive arc magmas , it has been argued that primary arc magmas are not necessarily oxidized ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
Considering the geotherm ' s concave downward shape of subducting slabs , ridge subduction is the most favorable tectonic setting for slab melting in the Phanerozoic .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .

Shapinggou . The Shapinggou porphyry Mo deposit is the largest
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
When there is no residual sulfide in the mantle source , Cu and also other chalcophile elements become highly incompatible ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .

There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .

Also shown is the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , thick horizontal orange line ; NNO and FMQ , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .

Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
In contrast , the oceanic plates subducting underneath the western North American continent are younger and have experienced only one Ocean Anoxic Event .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains the Au - rich capping feature of many reduced porphyry deposits .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .

There are several subducting ridges along the east Pacific margin , e . g . , in Chile and Peru in the South America .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin - Mariana , and other arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .

In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with reduced magmas
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is followed by emplacement the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
The uniform and low SO 3 contents in apatite from reduced magma deposits were used to argue that the low oxygen fugacity of these porphyries is primary ( Fig . 20 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .

At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .

Stability domains of trisulfur ion S 3 − at total dissolved sulfur concentrations of 1 wt . % and 0 . 1 wt . % are shown .
It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Evidence for reduced magmas of Catface porphyry deposit
The formation of the Catface porphyry deposit
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .

There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
Experiments show that sulfate is much more soluble than sulfide in magmas .
Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
More accurately , the ferrous Fe in fluids reacts with water , releasing H 2 and H + ( Eq .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bΔFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ΔFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
This implies that such porphyry deposits themselves are not genetically related to reduced magmas , i . e . , they are not the causative magma , but the host rock .
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .

This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .

Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulﬁde .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .

The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .

In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration .

Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
They are associated with carbonic - rich ore forming fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , and multiple intrusive events ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 ≥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 ≥ 15 wt . % , Y ≤ 18 ppm , Yb ≤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr ≥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The question is again why normal arc rocks in compressed environments do not form porphyry deposits .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ΔFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayalite–magnetite– quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .

No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .

What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
Some workers proposed that ΔFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ΔFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
This is one reason why the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magma did not change much ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or even decrease slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( see also Section 5 ) .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .

Therefore , small amount of reduced gases in fluid inclusions cannot argue against the oxidized feature of the magmas .

One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .

It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Among them are degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .

Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .

As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .

It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .

It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .

Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .

( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate oxidation potential of sulfate .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ΔFMQ − 1 and 1500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .

This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has long been proposed that oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 have reached the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
More importantly , compared to oxidized magmas , reduced magmas indeed have lower sulfur contents with S 2− occurring as the dominant sulfur species ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , but this does not necessarily mean higher S 2− in reduced magmas as claimed by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .

Some experiments suggest that D Mo increases with decreasing oxygen fugacities ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ΔFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .

From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .

We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ﬂuids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For example , there are also many porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( without economic levels of Mo ) in the western American continents , including some of the world ' s top 25 largest porphyry deposits , e . g . , Cerro Casale in Chile ; Minas Conga in Peru ; Bajo de la Alumbrera in Argentina ; Pebble Copper in the USA ; and Prosperity in Canada .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .

More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
This can best be explained by the reduction of Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .

This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .

As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S at sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This is probably mainly because the crust in backarc basins is too thin .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .

It has long been proposed that most porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013b , also known as the magnetite - series magmas ( Ishihara and Terashima , 1989 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The addition of subduction released oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to arc magmas is proposed as the most straightforward way , e . g . , water ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , oxidizing fluids and / or melts ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) , fluids with oxidizing components , e . g . , hematite , sulfate ( X . M .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Baogutu is located in West Junggar , Central Asian Orogenic Belt , and is the second largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , with controlled reserves of 0 . 63 Mt Cu @ 0 . 28 wt . % , 14 t Au @ 0 . 1 ppm , 1 . 8 × 10 4 t Mo @ 0 . 011 wt . % and 390 t Ag @ 1 . 8 ppm ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
Previous studies suggested that these magmas are a product of continental arc - style magmatism ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
Some researchers have even argued that Cu comes from the mantle , whereas Mo comes from the continental crust ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .

Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .

Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
Experiments with apatite have shown that SO 3 contents reflect the oxygen fugacity of the magmas ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( ± Au and ± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher ε Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .

Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
A similar model has been proposed based on geochemical and mineralogical studies by Shen and Pan ( 2013 ) , in which mineral composition data suggest that the primary magma of the Baogutu porphyry deposit is oxidized .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
Therefore , it does not require very high oxygen fugacities to eliminate residual sulfides .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
It is not clear whether the portion of the subducting slab underneath Qulong was continental or oceanic .

( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction S 3 − ( Eq .
This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
We propose that the reduced features of the Baogutu porphyry deposit are secondary and occurred during emplacement , thus having no major influence on the mineralization process .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
It has also been proposed that degassing of SO 2 may lower the oxygen fugacity ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .

The most straightforward way to elevate the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is by the addition of oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to the magmas .

In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .

The geodynamic and architectural controls on porphyry formation in this complex tectonic zone are unclear ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .

Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
Similar to El Teniente , the formation of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposits also lasted for several million years , between 36 and 31 Ma ( Ballard et al . , 2001 ; Ossandon et al . , 2001 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This was interpreted as the main evidence for degassing ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .

This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .

Further studies are needed on the formation of Sar - Cheshmeh and other Cenozoic porphyry deposits in the belt .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
During a period of recharge by mantle - derived mafic magmas into the base of the chamber and associated volatile transfer and concentration near its roof , the opportunity arose to produce the Cu - and S - rich magmas that formed the anhydrite - bearing intrusive rocks ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
These behaviors explain the popular occurrence of hypogene magnetite and hematite ( and specularite ) in porphyry deposits .

In principle , there are several ways to lower the oxygen fugacities during magma evolution .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .

Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values defined by the HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .

This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .

It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
This plausibly explains the common association between high - Mg adakites and porphyry Cu deposits .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .

As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
Degassing , however , is not likely to be a main process in porphyry mineralization that occurs at 2 - 4 km depths in the upper crust .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .

Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .

Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .

CH 4 þ 4Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 8FeO þ CO 2 þ 2H 2 Oð29Þ Considering that the Catface porphyry is not adakitic , it may well be simply the country rock that hosts the deposit .
All the samples with the exception of two were collected from the diorite , which are not porphyry at all .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .

It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaﬁei et al . , 2009 ) .
The orange field between HM and ΔFMQ + 2 is the optimum condition for porphyry Cu , Au , Mo mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
C þ 2Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 4FeO þ CO 2ð28Þ Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Based on the above discussion , we propose the following model for the formation of the Catface porphyry .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Potassic alteration is located in the center and deeper portions of the porphyry .
The problem with this model is that no studies have ever demonstrated that adakites are more hydrous than normal arc rocks .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
The distribution of porphyry deposits does not support the premise that the Cu comes from the mantle .
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It has been further proposed that in general geological processes where the tri - sulfur ion may have been involved need to be reconsidered ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , and this would require the investigation of different reaction pathways ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) ) together with alkali contents in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alteration ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
It is located in the western Dabie Mountains , along the east extension of the East Qinling Mo mineralization belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; H . Y .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .

This was attributed to sulfate buffering ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , i . e . , the oxidation of ferrous iron is coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide ( Eqs .

This process , however , was excluded from further consideration based on the low 87 Sr / 86 Sr of Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .

Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , subduction of reducing sediments is not a plausible explanation for the low fO 2 shown by the Catface porphyry .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

It is located in southwestern Iran and is associated with several intrusive pulses of Miocene stocks ( ~ 12 . 2 Ma ) ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) , ranging in composition from diorite through granodiorite to quartzmonzonite ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2− ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2− ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
As pointed out by the authors , detailed studies are needed to clarify the origin of the CH 4 .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .

Because of these uncertainties , it has been asserted that there is no single , obvious reason why slab melts have an unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits ( Richards , 2013 ) .
Second , there is no systematic difference in terms of emplacement depths and tectonic settings between reduced and oxidized porphyry deposits .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .

The total resources there are estimated to be N1 . 8 billion tons , accounting for about 60 % of the world ' s total Cu resource estimation ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .

Their contribution depends heavily on subsequent oxidation , i . e . , a major contribution can be expected only when the sulfide cumulates are oxidized to sulfate , liberating the chalcophile elements .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

Nevertheless , the oxygen fugacity undoubtedly fluctuated during porphyry mineralization ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , and the hydrothermal rutile only records the oxygen fugacities under which it crystallized .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .

Consistently , the Mo / Cu ratios of these deposits are generally more than 20 times higher than the primitive mantle ratio value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , suggesting that Mo has been added to the porphyry deposits from different sources .

Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .

Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Porphyry Cu ore formation
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive δ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .

The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .

The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .

Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .

argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .

Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .

Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .
In contrast , deep crustal amphibolites are preserved in the lithosphere , and will be susceptible to partial melting at any later time due to thermal rebound or reheating by invading asthenospheric melts .

Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .

The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .

Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .

When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( Audétat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the Roşia Montană epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .

As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu ± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 °C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425° - 320 °C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .

Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .

Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .

These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3× ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .

( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .

Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .

Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400° - 500 °C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .

Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400° - 350 °C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 °C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .

In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .

Continental China is a mosaic of numerous tectonic blocks , which amalgamated from Neoarchean through Cenozoic broadly coeval with the cycles of global supercontinents such as Kenorland , Columbia , Rodinia , Gondwana , and Pangaea .
Superimposed orogeny has reworked the lithospheric structure with concomitant granitoid - associated metallogeny .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .
The stratiform ore deposit , including BIF , VMS , and SEDEX , or sedimentary sulfide layers formed from Neoarchean to Paleozoic were modified by later mineralization , resulting in the enrichment of the various metal species and enhancement of ore resources .
The composite metallogenic system was dominantly characterized by the multi - episodic and diverse mineralization concomitant with one or more features including mineralization evolved from the previous metal enrichment , later overlap of ore deposit , and diversifying of metal species derived from 2 GR Focus Review reworked lithosphere .
Continental China is located at the junction of the Central Asian orogenic belt , Tethyan orogenic belt and the oceanic subduction zone of the Pacific plate ( Ren et al . , 2013 ; ) ( Fig . 1a ) . China is a collage of cratons and fragmental continental blocks and arcs , welded by multiple ophiolitic mélange .

The NE China microcontinental Block was affected by the Mongol - Okhotsk suture ( Fig . 1 ) to the north and the Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) to the south in Permo - Triassic ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Mongol - Okhotsk suture stretches along the southeastern boundary of the Siberian Craton over 3000 km , extending from the present - day Udsky gulf of the Okhotsk Sea to the Khangay mountain range in Central Mongolia ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) .
The Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) separates the Cathaysian flora province with tropical Permian floras in the south from the Angaran flora province with cool , temperate species in the north .
The Paleo - Tethyansutures in the Tibet and Sanjiangorogenic belts are characterized by several sub - parallel ophiolite complexes , composed of peridotites , gabbros , MORB - type basalts , and radiolarian cherts , juxtaposed with the subduction zone assemblage of UHP metamorphic rocks , arc magmatic rocks , and post - subduction S - type pluton .

The closure of Mianlue ocean started first in the Dabie region and migrated westward ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . 2006 ) from the Early Permian and to Middle - Late Triassic , causing the formation of Mianlue suture ( [ 26 ] ) .
Calcic to calcalkaline Permian - Triassic magmatic rocks are widespread in the East Kunlun ( [ 15 ] ) formed during the subduction - related orogenic period and the subsequent syn - to post - collision stage ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2015a ) .
The Sulu - Dabie high - to ultrahigh - pressure ( HP - UHP ) metamorphic belt ( [ 21 ] ) formed during the Triassic collision between the North China Craton and Yangtze Craton ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011b ; Deng et al . , 2014c ) .
The main metamorphic rocks in this belt include garnet peridotite , garnet pyroxenite , eclogite , schist , quartzite , marble , and various gneisses ( Ratschbacher et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng , et al . , 2009 ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating of paragneiss , orthogneiss , and eclogite from the Sulu belt indicate that the UHP peak metamorphic event took place at ~ 240 - 220Ma ( Fig . 1 ) , and then overprinted by amphibolite - facies retrograde metamorphic at ~ 220 - 210 Ma ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .
Biotite and muscovite Ar - Ar thermochronology of mylonitic gneiss from Sulu belt suggest that the UHP metamorphic rocks started to exhume at ~ 220 - 200 Ma ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .

Jurassic to Cretaceous subduction system
The Jurassic to Cenozoic subduction systems are developed both along southwestern and eastern margins of China .
Southward oceanic subduction of the Bangong - Nujiang Ocean from the Permian to the Early Cretaceous gave rise to extensive calc - alkaline magmatism on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Zhang et al . , 2012b ) .
The westward flat subduction of the Paleo - Pacific oceanic crust resulted in extensive late - Mesozoic magmatism dominantly along the eastern margin of China , named East Coast Arc ( [ 28 ] ) in this paper ( Fig . 1 ) .

These features of the sediments correspond to the anomalous metal enrichment , diverse accessory metals , and complex isotopic signature of the MVT ore deposits formed in Oligocene within basins .
This suture marks the final suture of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( Zhang et al . , 2010a ; Wu et al . , 2000 ; Ge et al . , 2007 ) .
This was explained by mixing of a mantlederived magma with a granitic melt formed by magma underplating in the crust , which formed in the post - orogenic setting ( Wei et al . , 2013a ) .
This is inferred to relate to the increase of slab - dip angle of the Pacific oceanic plate subduction beneath southeastern China ( Zhou and Li , 2000 ) .

By reviewing the long - lasting geological evolution in the different tectonic blocks , it reveals that more than two episodes of tectonic events , including accretionary and collisional orogeny , and dismantling , as well as mantle plume , occurred successively or simultaneously within a single tectonic belt . . . .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment during the previous subduction - and later collision - related magmatic events in the Lhasa block provide important insights into mineral potential .
H9 slate formed at 1505 ± 12 Ma and the H8 dolomite was deposited during the Mesoproterozoic ( Lai et al . , 2015 ) .
The tectonic history in the southern Tibet from 25 to 10 Ma suggests that as the underthrusting of continental lithosphere was initiated , the magmatic events tended to subside ( Chung et al . , 2005 ) .
Extensive researches have been carried out on the composition and evolution of orogenic belts , such as the Jiangnan belt in South China Block ( Zhu et al . , 2012c ; Li et al . , 2012a ) , the Central Asian orogenic belt ( Han et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2015b ) , the Qinling - Qilian - Kunlun belt ( Sun et al . , 2003 ; Wu and Zheng , 2013 ; Dong and Santosh ,

Typical hypogene porphyry Cu deposits have average grades of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent Cu , < 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 percent Mo , and 0 . 0× to 1 . 5 g / t Au , although a few " Auonly " deposits have Au tenors of 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 g / t but little Cu ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Porphyry Cu systems show a marked tendency to occur in linear , typically orogen - parallel belts , which range from a few tens to hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long , as exemplified by the Andes of western South America ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Fig . 2 ) and the Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt of Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria ( Janković , 1977 ; Popov et al . , 2002 ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu belts developed during well - defined metallogenic epochs , which isotopic dating shows to have typical durations of 10 to 20 m . y .
Individual porphyry Cu belts are commonly spatially separate rather than superimposed on one another , reflecting arc migration as a result of steepening or shallowing of subducted slabs between the individual magmatic - metallogenic epochs ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems are generated mainly in magmatic arc ( including backarc ) environments subjected to a spectrum of regional - scale stress regimes , apparently ranging from moderately extensional through oblique slip to contractional ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Strongly extensional settings , typified by compositionally bimodal basalt - rhyolite magmatism , lack significant porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1999a ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

Faults and fault intersections are invariably involved , to greater or lesser degrees , in determining the formational sites and geometries of porphyry Cu systems and their constituent parts .
Intra - arc fault systems , active before as well as during magmatism and porphyry Cu generation , are particularly important localizers , as exemplified by the Domeyko fault system during development of the preeminent middle Eocene to early Oligocene belt of northern Chile ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 , and references therein ; Fig . 2 ) .
Arc - parallel alignments may occur along intra - arc fault zones , as exemplified by the Chuquicamata district , northern Chile ( Fig . 3b ) whereas cross - arc fault zones or lineaments control arc - transverse alignments , as in the Cadia , New South Wales ( Fig . 3c ) and Oyu Tolgoi , Mongolia districts ( Fig . 3d ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Outcropping precursor plutons normally represent the shallower , earlier consolidated parts rather than the magma volumes from which the fluids for porphyry Cu generation were derived ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline or , less commonly , alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .

Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Massive carbonate sequences , particularly where marble is developed near intrusive contacts , and other poorly fractured , fine - grained rocks have the capacity to act as relatively Serrano et al . , 1996 ; J . C . Toro , writ .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may be similarly blind , beneath a thick limestone sequence in the case of Pueblo Viejo .
Ferrous Fe - rich lithologic units also appear to favor highgrade porphyry Cu mineralization ( e . g . , Ray and Mineral Park , Arizona ; Phillips et al . , 1974 ; Wilkinson et al . , 1982 ) , presumably because of their capacity to effectively precipitate Cu transported in oxidized magmatic fluids ( see below ) .
Mineralization elsewhere in porphyry Cu systems may be even more profoundly influenced by rock type .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .

Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Wall - rock xenoliths in the marginal parts of some porphyry intrusions may be sufficiently abundant to constitute intrusion breccias .
Mo - rich porphyry Cu deposits are normally tied to the more felsic intrusions , whereas Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits tend to be related to the more mafic end members , although intrusions as felsic as quartz monzonite may also host Au - rich examples ( e . g . , Mamut , East Malaysia ; Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ) .
Diatreme breccias have a distinctive texture , in which widely separated , typically centimeter - sized clasts are dominated by rock - flour matrix containing an andesitic to dacitic tuffaceous component ( Table 1 ) , the latter commonly difficult to recognize where alteration is intense .

Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
The late - mineral porphyry lacks veinlets and displays only propylitic alteration .
The breccia clasts may be set in rock - flour matrix , hydrothermal cement , fine - grained igneous material , or some combination of the three .
Igneous matrices tend to be more common at depth near the magmatic source , where the term igneous breccia is appropriately applied ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , generally occupying steep , pipelike to irregular bodies , are commonly intermineral in timing as a result of being generated in close association with intermineral porphyry phases ( Figs . 6 , 8 ) .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Sericitized breccia may change downward to potassic - altered breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Phreatic breccias , as exemplified by pebble dikes , normally contain polymictic clast populations set in muddy , rock - flour matrices ( Table 1 ) .
The tops of the orebodies tend to be relatively abrupt and controlled by the apices of quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The shape of any porphyry Cu orebody may undergo significant modification as a result of emplacement of late - to postmineral rock volumes ( e . g . , Fig . 5a ) , as exemplified by the low - grade cores caused by internal emplacement of latemineral porphyry phases ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Philippines ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) and , much less commonly , latestage diatremes ( e . g . , El Teniente ; Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Camus , 2003 ) .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Alteration - mineralization zoning in porphyry Cu deposits
Porphyry Cu deposits display a consistent , broad - scale alteration - mineralization zoning pattern that comprises , centrally from the bottom upward , several of sodic - calcic , potassic , chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and advanced argillic ( cf .
Chloritic and propylitic alteration develop distally at shallow and deeper levels , respectively ( Fig . 10 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Sericitic alteration may project vertically downward as an annulus separating the potassic and propylitic zones as well as cutting the potassic zone centrally as shown .
Sericitic alteration tends to be more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits , whereas chlorite - sericite alteration develops preferentially in porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration - mineralization in the lithocap is commonly far more complex than shown , particularly where structural control is paramount .
Quartzalunite
Quartzkaolinite
Sodic - calcic alteration , commonly magnetite bearing ( Table 2 ) , is normally rather poorly preserved at depth in some porphyry Cu deposits , commonly in the immediate wall rocks to the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Panguna , Papua New Guinea and El Teniente ; Ford , 1978 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , a position that may give rise to confusion with propylitic alteration ( Fig . 10 ) .

Sodic - calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Nugget Hill , Philippines ) , in some of which hybrid potassic - calcic ( biotite - actinolite - magnetite ) assemblages are also commonplace ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Ridgeway , and Cotabambas , southern Peru ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Wilson et al . , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004a ) .
Biotite is the predominant alteration mineral in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , whereas K - feldspar increases in abundance in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings .
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Pyrrhotite may accompany the pyrite where reduced host rocks are present ( e . g . , Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 2003b ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration ( Table 2 ) , giving rise to distinctive , pale - green rocks , is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , particularly Au - rich examples , where it overprints preexisting potassic assemblages ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10−12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety that is greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .

Distal Au skarns are typically more reduced ( pyroxene rich ) than their proximal counterparts ( Fortitude , Copper Canyon district ; Myers and Meinert , 1991 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits display single veinlet sequences that comply with the generalizations summarized above and ( Barr et al . , 1976 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2002 .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .

PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS in Figure 13 and Table 2 , but repetitions of group 1 and 2 veinlets , for example , early biotite , EDM halo , and A types cut by lesser numbers of later EDM halo and A types ( e . g . , Bingham ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ) , occur where time gaps between porphyry phases are sufficiently large ; however , group 2 and 3 veinlets are only uncommonly repeated .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .

Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Absence of anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .

Tourmaline may occur in minor amounts in several veinlet types , even those formed early in deposit histories ( e . g . , T4 veinlets al Los Pelambres ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) , but it is most abundant with quartz and / or pyrite in D - type veinlet generations and any associated magmatic - hydrothermal breccias affected by sericitic alteration ( Fig . 8 ) .
Advanced argillic lithocaps
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , which may either wholly or partially overlie and conceal porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) or occur alongside them and , hence , above propylitic rock ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina , Argentina , Batu Hijau , and Rosia Poieni , Romania ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ; Clode et al . , 1999 ; Milu et al . , 2004 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components of many ledges .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components ledges .
Metal zoning in porphyry Cu systems is well documented , particularly at the deeper , porphyry Cu levels ( e . g . , Jerome , 1966 ; Titley , 1993 ) .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
Peripheral veins cutting propylitic halos may also be Au rich , and at Mineral Park an outward zoning from Pb - Zn to Au - Ag is evident ( Eidel et al . , 1968 ; Lang and Eastoe , 1988 ; Fig . 9b ) .

The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious and base metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Magma and fluid production
Porphyry Cu systems typically span the upper 4 km or so of the crust ( Singer et al . , 2008 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) , with their centrally located stocks being connected downward to parental magma chambers at depths of perhaps 5 to 15 km ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ; Fig . 4 ) .
The parental chambers , tending to be localized at sites of neutral buoyancy ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) , are the sources of both magmas and hightemperature , high - pressure metalliferous fluids throughout system development .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Convection provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of copious amounts of the aqueous phase , in the form of bubble - rich magma , from throughout the parental chambers to the basal parts of porphyry stocks or dike swarms ( Candela , 1991 ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The shallow - level porphyry stocks do not themselves generate the bulk of the magmatic fluid volume , but simply act as " exhaust valves , " conduits for its upward transmission from the parental chambers , perhaps via cupolas on their roofs ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu mineralization in the deeply formed ( up to 9 km ) potassic alteration zones at Butte and elsewhere took place directly from a single - phase , relatively low salinity ( 2−10 wt % NaCl equiv ) , aqueous liquid ( Rusk et al . , 2004 ( Rusk et al . , , 2008a ; such a phase may contain several thousand ppm to several percent of base metals and several ppm Au , based on thermodynamic ( Heinrich , 2005 ) and analytical ( Audétat et al . , 2008 ) observations .
Fluid inclusion microanalysis and experimental studies reveal that , during phase separation , specific element suites selectively fractionate between the vapor and hypersaline liquid .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S ± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Potassic alteration and associated metal deposition are initiated under near - lithostatic conditions and involve extensive hydraulic fracturing of the ductile rock at high strain rates ( Fournier , 1999 ) to generate the pervasive stockwork veining ( Burnham , 1979 ) : a process that may give rise to large increases in rock volume ( Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The single - phase liquid , the mineralizer in deeply formed porphyry Cu deposits , may generate the relatively uncommon EDM halo veinlets ( Rusk et al . , 2008a ; Proffett , 2009 ) , whereas the two - phase fluid produces the more common A - and B - type quartz veinlets ( e . g . , Roedder , 1984 , and references therein ) .
The stockwork veinlets control and focus continued fluid ascent , with partial dissolution of quartz during cooling through its retrograde solubility field ( < ~ 550 - 400 °C at pressures < ~ 900 b ; Fournier , 1999 ) enhancing the permeability of the A - type quartz veinlets during at least some of the Cu - Fe sulfide precipitation ( Rusk and Reed , 2002 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) ; synmineral faulting and fracturing may play a similar role .
The quartz - veined cores of potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .

Fluid pressures may fluctuate from lithostatic to hydrostatic during porphyry Cu formation ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , as a result of both repetitive fracture propagation and sealing and reductions in confining pressure consequent upon surface degradation ( see below ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal brecciation may be triggered by sudden release of fluid overpressures caused by roof failure above large , expanding vapor bubbles ( Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; Burnham , 1985 ) , particularly near the ductile - brittle transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions have crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .

Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10× dilution of the hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .

High Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .

The Cordilleran massive sulfide lodes are localized where the liquid follows pronounced structural permeability spanning the sericitic to advanced argillic transition ( Figs . 6 , 10 ) or , less commonly , encounters reactive carbonate rocks ( e . g . , Baumgartner et al . , 2008 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Diatreme breccias are preferentially emplaced at this time because external water access to late - mineral magma bodies , a requirement for phreatomagmatic activity , is facilitated .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts where porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms are overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .

Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive , thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .

Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .

Porous and permeable volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequences also favor large - tonnage orebody development in the lithocap environment , especially where they happen to be shallowly located with respect to paleosurfaces .

Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
Thermal regimes that permit vertically extensive ore zone development in potassic zones commonly have greater size potential than those that were excessively hot internally , thereby inhibiting sulfide precipitation and giving rise to large , lowgrade or barren cores ; the exception is where the resultant shell - like orebodies are areally extensive and thick ( e . g . , Bingham and Resolution ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .

porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing and bornite - free potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

Structural permeability linking porphyry stocks to the fringes of carbonate rock - dominated districts seems to be a requirement for formation of substantial sediment - hosted Au deposits ( e . g . , Bingham district ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are arguably the most studied and potentially best known and understood ore deposit type ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , and their relationships with the skarn environment have been appreciated for many years ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A positive topographic expression results only where barren , late - to postmineral porphyry plugs intrude the diatreme breccias ( e . g . , Dizon and Guinaoang , Philippines and Batu Hijau ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Fig . 6 ) .
A quartz - pyrite assemblage replaces any carbonate rocks incorporated in advanced argillic lithocaps ( e . g . , Bisbee , Arizona ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
The distinctive aplitic groundmass texture is ascribed to pressure quenching during rapid ascent and consequent volatile loss ( Burnham , 1967 ) .
The pebble dikes and related breccias are chiefly restricted to porphyry Cu deposits , including their marginal parts , whereas brecciation induced by the fluid confinement typifies the overlying highsulfidation epithermal environment ( Fig . 6 ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration has varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .

In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts of porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
The upper parts of porphyry Cu systems , mainly at shallower levels than their porphyry intrusions , are characterized by lithocaps : lithologically controlled zones of pervasive advanced argillic alteration with structurally controlled components , including their subvertical root zones ( Figs . 4 , 6 , 10 ; Table 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

The parental magmas need to be water rich ( > ~ 4 wt % ) and oxidized in order to maximize the metal contents of the resultant aqueous phase ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Candela , 1992 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700° to 550 °C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .

As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .

The low - salinity liquid , whose ascent is controlled by the preexisting quartz veinlet stockworks , synmineral faults , and permeability contrasts provided by steep intrusive contacts , appears to be responsible for the progressive formation of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic alteration , as well as continued advanced argillic alteration and the principal Cu and Au mineralization in the overlying lithocaps Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Rusk et al . , 2008b ) .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction to produce liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .

If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps in which quartz - pyrophyllite ± muscovite ± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .

The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks , but generally prior to initiation of the systems .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .

The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz - bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration - mineralization .

The Cu and , in places , Au contents of skarns are typically higher still .
Each belt corresponds to a magmatic arc of broadly similar overall dimensions .
The stress regime depends , among other factors , on whether there is trench advance or rollback and the degree of obliquity of the plate convergence vector ( Dewey , 1980 ) .
The precursor plutons may act as hosts to a single deposit , as at Mount Polley , British Columbia ( Fraser et al . , 1995 ) ; an alignment of coalesced deposits , as in the Los Bronces - Río Blanco district ( Fig . 5a ) ; or clusters of two or more discrete deposits , as in the El Abra intrusive complex , northern Chile ( Fig . 5b ) and Guichon Creek batholith , Highland Valley district , British Columbia ( Fig . 5c ) .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The precursor pluton is multiphase , whereas the parental pluton is shown as a single body in which the concentric dotted lines mark its progressive inward consolidation .
The volcanic sequence is a stratovolcano ( but could just as readily be a dome complex ; Fig . 6 ) and has been partly eroded prior to porphyry Cu formation .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts of the underlying rocks .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts underlying rocks .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry Cu - related intrusions comprise multiple phases ( Kirkham , 1971 ; Gustafson , 1978 ) , which were emplaced immediately before ( early porphyries ) , during ( intermineral porphyries ) , near the end of ( late mineral porphyries ) , and after ( postmineral porphyries ) the alteration and mineralization events ( Fig . 6 ) .
The earlier porphyry bodies are not destroyed when intruded by later phases but merely split apart , causing overall inflation of the rock package as would occur during ordinary dike emplacement .
The upper contacts of a few porphyry Cu intrusions are characterized by unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) : alternating , crenulate layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyry produced as a result of pressure fluctuations at the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions ( e . g . , Kirkham and Sinclair , 1988 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; .

The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The porphyry intrusions contain variable amounts of phenocrysts , typically including hornblende and / or biotite , and fine - grained , commonly aplitic groundmass , resulting in open to crowded textures .
The porphyry phases in some individual deposits may have clear compositional differences ( e . g . , Bajo de la Alumbrera ; Proffett , 2003 ) and / or characteristic igneous textures ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) ; however , particularly in many porphyry Au and Cu - Au deposits , the different phases are commonly only subtly different or nearly identical .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix of many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .

Many diatremes are late - stage additions to porphyry Cu systems , in which they commonly postdate and either cut or occur alongside porphyry Cu mineralization at depth ( Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Garwin , 2002 ) but overlap with high - sulfidation events at shallower epithermal levels ( e . g . , Dizon ; Fig . 6 ) .
The diatremes , particularly their contact zones , may localize part of the high - sulfidation Au mineralization ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu , Papua New Guinea ; Fig . 6 ) .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .

The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .
The breccias are typically late - stage features and , hence , unaltered and barren .
the magmatic - hydrothermal breccias and pebble dikes at the porphyry Cu level , these phreatic breccias in the high - sulfidation environment may attain the paleosurface , where hydrothermal eruptions result in subaerial breccia accumulation as aprons around the eruptive vents ( e . g . , Hedenquist and Henley , 1985 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The massive , high - sulfidation pyrite - enargite replacements in carbonate rocks are also locally transitional outward through high - to intermediate - sulfidation Zn - Pb - Ag ore , a continuum observed in the Tintic and Colquijirca districts ( Lindgren and Loughlin , 1919 ; Bendezú et al . , 2003 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers of rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .

The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .

The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .

The Cu - bearing sulfides typically occur as fine - grained coatings on disseminated pyrite grains , which leads to recognition difficulties in deposits that also underwent supergene Cu sulfide enrichment ( e . g . , Chuquicamata , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) ; indeed , the hypogene contribution is commonly not distinguished from the supergene enrichment products ( e . g . , Taca Taca Bajo , Argentina ; Rojas et al . , 1999 ) .

Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .

The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits where relevant data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .

The quartz veinlets commonly cut proximal prograde exoskarn ( Einaudi , 1982 ) but do not extend into the more distal carbonate rock - hosted ore types .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers of both translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .

The roots of lithocaps may also contain the relatively high temperature species , andalusite and corundum ( > ~ 370ºC ; Hemley et al . , 1980 ) , as accompaniments to pyrophyllite and / or muscovite ( e . g . , Cabang Kiri , Indonesia , El Salvador , and Cerro Colorado ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .
The principal borosilicate mineral in lithocaps is dumortierite rather than tourmaline .

Any intermediate - sulfidation precious metal mineralization developed alongside the lithocaps contains much higher contents of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn than the high - sulfidation orebodies , in keeping with the situation described above from the porphyry Cu level .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .

Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain minor volumes ( 5−10 % ) of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia ( Fig . 6 ) ; however , even major deposits can be either breccia free , as at Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , or breccia dominated , as exemplified by > 5 Gt of ore - grade breccia at Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Warnaars et al . , 1985 ; Serrano et al . , 1996 ; Fig . 5a ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits are formed as vertically extensive bodies , which become progressively lower grade both outward and downward , whereas others have a bell - or cap - like form because little Cu was precipitated internally at depth ( e . g . , Resolution ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
Many lithocaps are vertically zoned , from the previously described quartz - pyrophyllite at depth to predominant quartz - alunite and residual quartz - the residue of extreme base leaching ( Stoffregen , 1987 ) with a vuggy appearance that reflects the original rock texture - at shallower levels where the causative fluid was cooler and , hence , more acidic ( Giggenbach , 1997 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Late porphyry Cu system evolution
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .

These phreatic breccias host ore in many high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu deposits ( e . g . , Choquelimpie , northern Chile ; Gröpper et al . , 1991 ) .
A few deposits , instead of dying out either gradually ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) or fairly abruptly ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq , Pakistan ) at depth , have knife - sharp bases as a result of truncation by latemineral intrusions ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
These high - sulfidation assemblages commonly have higher Cu contents than the former potassic alteration , resulting in hypogene enrichment ( Brimhall , 1979 ) , although any Au may be depleted ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .

These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline or chalcedonic silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ºC ) of silica deposition .

These Zn - Pb - Ag ± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As ± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Early porphyry Cu system evolution
These pressure variations may induce changes in the fluid phases present and consequent remobilization as well as precipitation of metals ( e . g . , Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic assemblages , and sericitic alteration does the same to potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .

In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu ± Au ± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Where lower grade intermineral intrusions and barren lateand postmineral intrusions or diatremes are volumetrically important , the original mineralized rock volumes may be physically disrupted and ore - zone geometries radically changed and generally rendered less continuous .
Hence , pebble dikes display downward transitions to porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Tintic , Utah and Toquepala , southern Peru ; Farmin , 1934 ; Zweng and Clark , 1995 ) , whereas the breccias triggered by fluid confinement do not normally form in close proximity to intrusive bodies .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration is centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

Such a decrease in solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

As the thermal regimes of porphyry Cu systems decay , shallowly generated alteration - mineralization types become telescoped over more deeply formed ones ( e . g . , Gustafson , 1978 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) , thereby causing the sequence of metal remobilization and reprecipitation events emphasized above .

In any deposit cluster or alignment , the best deposit may be found first or only after several lesser discoveries have already been made ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Kirwin et al . , 2003 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .
In some bornite - rich centers , the sulfidation state is low enough to stabilize digenite ± chalcocite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Table 2 ) .

There , Cu ± Mo ± Au characterize the potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic cores of systems .
In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo tends to be concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

The only fluid present is of external origin and produces propylitic alteration similar to that in the earlier formed propylitic halos .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .

Vertical clast transport may be appreciable ( e . g . , > 1 km at Tintic ; Morris and Lovering , 1979 ) .
Although rock flour may occur between the clasts , quartz , chalcedony , alunite , barite , pyrite , and enargite are also widely observed as cementing minerals .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
Specific opaque mineral assemblages are intrinsic parts of each alteration type ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) because of the direct linkage between sulfidation state , the chief control on sulfide assemblages , and solution pH , a principal control of alteration type ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ; Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Fig . 12 ) .
Although Cu and / or Au tenors of the former potassic zones may undergo depletion during the chlorite - sericite overprints ( e . g . , Esperanza , northern Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) , metal introduction is also widely recognized ( e . g . , Leach , 1999 ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) and , at a few deposits , is considered to account for much of the contained Cu ( e . g . , Cerro Colorado , northern Chile ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .

The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .

The same liquid continues upward into the lithocap where , upon cooling in an unbuffered environment , it evolves into a high sulfidation - state liquid ; if properly focused , it may generate high - sulfidation ( HS ) epithermal deposits .
Abundant hydrothermal magnetite is a good indicator of potentially Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe , 1979 ) , and the presence of banded quartz veinlets may be used to identify most , but not all , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits .
( 7 ) if externally derived , nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?

This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems , including the overlying lithocaps .
Note that subvolcanic basement rocks host much of the porphyry Cu deposit on the left , whereas that on the right is mainly enclosed by two phases of the precursor pluton .

However , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits appear to occur exclusively in association with calcalkaline diorite and quartz diorite porphyries ( e . g . , .
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Note that shallow alteration - mineralization types consistently overprint deeper ones .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K ± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

However , sericitic alteration may also constitute ore where appreciable Cu remains with the pyrite , either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( typically , pyrite - bornite , pyrite - chalcocite , pyrite - covellite , pyritetennantite , and pyrite - enargite ; Table 2 ; cf .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .

overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , effects that are accompanied by downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
However , meteoric water involvement in late sericitic alteration is by no means precluded ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , particularly on the margins of systems where the advecting magmatic liquid may entrain convecting meteoric water , although its formerly preeminent role in the porphyry Cu genetic model ( e . g . , Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Hunt , 1991 ) is now greatly diminished .
However , local structural observations , perhaps interpreted from geophysical responses , may assist in this regard , although this approach played no part in the recent discoveries noted above in the Chilean porphyry Cu districts .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .

Unusually large , laterally extensive proximal skarn bodies may form preferentially where suitable carbonate host rocks abut the tops of porphyry stocks ( e . g . , Antamina ; Redwood , 2004 ) .

However , through - going structural ( fault and fracture network ) and hydrothermal ( phreatic breccia and vuggy , residual quartz ) permeability is probably the most critical requirement for the development of important high - sulfidation deposits ; otherwise , inadequate latestage aqueous liquids from the cooling parental magma chambers gain access to the lithocaps .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal - or Au - bearing veins and mantos .
Along with calc - alkaline batholiths and volcanic chains , they are the hallmarks of magmatic arcs constructed above active subduction zones at convergent plate margins ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ) , although a minority of such systems occupies postcollisional and other tectonic settings that develop after subduction ceases ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .

Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .

Changes in crustal stress regime are considered by some as especially favorable times for porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposit generation ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) , with Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera , Argentina , for example , both apparently occupying such a tectonic niche ( Presnell , 1997 ; Sasso and Clark , 1998 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
The entire breccia body originally underwent potassic alteration prior to partial overprinting by sericitic and , subsequently , advanced argillic assemblages , as documented by localized occurrence of remanent magnetite and muscovite after coarse - grained biotite in the cement to the sericitized breccia .

Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .

There , it condenses into ground water to oxidize and produce the low - temperature , acidic fluid responsible for the blanketlike , advanced argillic alteration zones characteristic of the steam - heated environment ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

Commonly , the highest grade and most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .

Elsewhere , small - volume porphyry intrusions and the associated magmatic fluids fail to effectively penetrate low - permeability rock packages , leading to the apparently uncommon development of blind , high - grade deposits , as at Hugo Dummett in the Oyu Tolgoi district ( Kirwin et al . , 2003 and Ridgeway in the Cadia district ( Wilson et al . , 2003 ) .
Diatremes , upward - flared volcanic vents generated mainly by phreatomagmatic eruptive activity , are widespread in porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1985 ) , including their shallow , epithermal parts ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Much of the Mo in many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits occurs in the B - type veinlets , in marked contrast to the Cu dominance of the A - type generations , but D - type veinlets may also contain appreciable amounts of molybdenite in some deposits .
Addition of mafic melt to the parental chambers could be an effective means of augmenting S and metal budgets Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Maughan et al . , 2002 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Progressive disproportionation of the contained SO 2 ( to H 2 SO 4 and H 2 S ) once it and HCl ( plus any HF ) condense into ground water ( Giggenbach , 1992 ; Rye , 1993 ) generates the extremely low pH fluid responsible for the high degrees of base leaching involved in advanced argillic lithocap formation ( e . g . , Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Clusters are broadly equidimensional groupings of deposits ( e . g . , Globe - Miami district , Arizona ; Fig . 3a ) , whereas alignments are linear deposit arrays oriented either parallel or transverse to the magmatic arcs and their coincident porphyry Cu belts .

However , in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , the Au , as small ( < 20 µm ) grains of high ( > 900 ) fineness native metal and in solid solution in bornite and , to a lesser degree , chalcopyrite ( e . g . , Arif and Baker , 2002 ) , and Cu are introduced together as components of centrally located potassic zones ; hence , the two metals normally correlate closely ( Sillitoe , 2000 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
In arcs where volcanic rocks are abundant , large - volume ignimbrites , indicative of caldera formation , are taken to seriously downgrade porphyry Cu and related epithermal Au potential for the reason given above .
In contrast , D - type veinlets may be up to 1 km laterally away from the target .

Where intense chlorite - sericite or sericitic alteration overprints are developed , the reconstitution of potassic alteration may result in either reduction or complete stripping of original metal contents .

However , the erosion involved in the unroofing of porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .

In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .

However , the patches may also comprise alunite or kaolinite , suggesting that the texture may result by either preferential nucleation of any common advanced argillic mineral or even advanced argillic overprinting of a nucleation texture developed during earlier potassic or chlorite - sericite alteration of fragmental rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 , and Caspiche ) .

However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
In contrast , Cu and Mo correlate less well , with spatial separation of the two metals commonly resulting from the different timing of their introduction ( e . g . , Los Pelambres ; Atkinson et al . , 1996 ) .
In contrast , Mo may be transported as different , possibly oxochloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( Ulrich and Mavrogenes , 2008 ) .
The different Mo complexing ( see above ) , probably assisted by progressive increase of the Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , results in much of the molybdenite being precipitated not only later than but also spatially separate from the bulk of the Cu ± Au ( see above ) .

These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .

The resultant telescoping is potentially more extreme , giving rise to deep penetration of advanced argillic alteration into porphyry stocks , where porphyry Cu systems undergo either rapid , synhydrothermal erosion under high uplift , pluvial or glacial conditions ( Fig . 14 ) or , perhaps less commonly , gravity - induced sector collapse of any overlying volcanic edifices ( Sillitoe , 1994 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Landtwing et al . , 2002 ; Carman , 2003 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ) .

Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .

For example , porphyry Cu prospects containing only weakly developed potassic alteration and A - type quartz veinlets in their central parts , indicating a deficiency of early - stage magmatic fluids , are typically subore grade .
Although many hydrothermal breccias , like the late diatremes mentioned above , are commonly diluents to ore , some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias give rise to anomalously highgrade rock volumes despite their intermineral timing .
Furthermore , magmatic - hydrothermal breccia cemented mainly by quartz , tourmaline , and pyrite may be zoned downward over hundreds of meters to chalcopyrite - rich material , which is likely to persist into any underlying biotite - cemented breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Fig . 8 ) .
( 10 ) why is Au transported to the distal limits of only a few porphyry Cu systems for concentration in sediment - hosted deposits , and why are most of these apparently small compared to virtually identical Carlin - type deposits ( Cline et al . , 2005 ) ?
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .

Commonly , the xenoliths are largely assimilated by the younger phases , leaving only the contained quartz veinlets , chemically more refractory than the host porphyry , as " floating " pieces ( Fig . 7 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .

In contrast to The alteration - mineralization is zoned from advanced argillic ( with pyriteenargite ) at the top through sericitic ( with shallow pyrite and deep chalcopyrite ) to potassic ( with magnetite - chalcopyrite ± bornite ) at the bottom , where the breccia texture may be almost imperceptible and pegmatoidal pods are commonplace .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .

In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous , retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .

Apart from the massive , commonly enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .

Nevertheless , the lithocap mineralization also contains greater albeit trace amounts of Bi , W , Sn , and / or Te ( e . g . , Einaudi , 1982 ) as well as appreciable Mo .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Nevertheless , resorption of any sulfide melt during ascent of oxidized magmatic fluids could make a major contribution to metal budgets ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ) .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched in Na , K , and Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .

The voluminous vapor readily separates from the coexisting hypersaline liquid and , because of its lower density , ascends buoyantly into the 1 - to 2 - km - thick rock column above the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Cooling of the hypersaline liquid in contact with external wall rocks and dilution with meteoric water in the propylitic halos may be the main causes of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn precipitation ( Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) , giving rise to the geochemical halos of these metals and , in some systems , localized vein concentrations ( Jerome , 1966 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
( 2 ) what are cross - arc lineaments , and can they be demonstrated to play a truly influential role in the localization of porphyry Cu systems ?
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps .
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries lithocaps .
The sequence of alteration - mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling , from > 700° to < 250 °C , caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition .
The size of the stocks does not appear to bear any obvious relationship to the size of the associated porphyry Cu deposits and their Cu contents ( cf .
The most common hydrothermal breccias in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems are of magmatic - hydrothermal type , the products of release of overpressured magmatic FIG .
Hence , many of the breccias overprint preexisting alteration - mineralization patterns and veinlet types ( e . g . , Red Mountain , Arizona ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , which are incorporated as clasts .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
On entering the lithocap environment , this intermediate sulfidation - state liquid ( forming chalcopyrite and tennantite at depth ) becomes unbuffered and easily evolves to a higher sulfidation state on cooling ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
Each individual deposit or prospect must be carefully constructed using surface mapping and core logging , with particular attention paid to the temporal as well as spatial relationships of its constituent parts .

The processes of subduction erosion and terrane accretion at convergent margins may assist with land - or trenchward migration of the arcs and contained porphyry Cu belts ( e . g . , von Huene and Scholl , 1991 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Several types of phreatic ( meteoric - hydrothermal ) breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .

The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization types become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 12 ) , with the result that the shallower alteration - mineralization zones invariably overprint and at least partly reconstitute deeper ones .
younger than the potassic zone that it overprints ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Padilla - Garza et al . , 2004 ) , reflecting the time needed for the telescoping to take place .
In some systems , Mn ( ± Ag ) is also markedly enriched in the outermost parts of the halos ( e . g . , Butte ; Meyer et al . , 1968 ) .
The recent major porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au discoveries in the productive Collahuasi ( Rosario Oeste ) , Chuquicamata ( Toki cluster ; Rivera and Pardo , 2004 ; Fig . 3b ) , Escondida ( Pampa Escondida ) , and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Los Sulfatos ; Fig . 5a ) districts of Chile are all within < 1 to 3 km of the previously known deposits , as are the several porphyry Cu - Au discoveries in the Cadia district ( Holliday et al . , 1999 ) and high - sulfidation Au discoveries in the Yanacocha district ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) that were made since mining commenced .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .

The forms of many porphyry Cu deposits mimic those of their host intrusions ; thus , cylindrical stocks typically host cylindrical orebodies ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas laterally extensive dikes give rise to orebodies with similar narrow , elongate shapes ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
It may constitute annular zones separating the potassic cores from propylitic halos , as emphasized in early porphyry Cu models ( Jerome , 1966 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Rose , 1970 ) , but is perhaps more common as structurally controlled or apparently irregular replacements within the upper parts of chlorite - sericite and / or potassic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .

Once formed , the quartz - bearing veinlets are permanent features that are not erased during subsequent alteration overprinting , although their metal contents may be wholly or partially removed ( see above ) .

In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .

Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .

Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization at shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .

Proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted mineralization types are obviously dependent on the presence of reactive carbonate rocks , particularly thinly bedded , silty units .
Large parts of many porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Titley , 1982 ) , especially deeply formed ( e . g . , Butte ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008a or relatively deeply eroded examples like El Abra ( Ambrus , 1977 ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) and Gaby ( Gabriela Mistral ) , northern Chile ( Camus , 2001 ( Camus , , 2003 , are made up predominantly of potassic alteration , which grades marginally into generally weakly developed propylitic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The sequence , from potassic with peripheral propylitic ( prop ) through chlorite - sericite and sericitic to advanced argillic , is the result of increasing acidity consequent upon the declining temperature of the hydrothermal fluids .
Note the absence of Cu - bearing sulfides from the early , high - temperature advanced argillic zone .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .

Much of the metal in many porphyry Cu deposits is contained in the quartz - dominated , group 2 veinlets and as disseminated grains in the intervening potassic - altered rocks , although some of the late , group 3 quartz - sulfide veins and their wall rocks may also be important contributors .
Indeed , two or more porphyry Cu deposits may underlie some large , coalesced lithocaps ( Fig . 4 ) , which , as noted above , may have formed progressively over periods of up to several million years ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .

In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( ± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
In addition , upward decompression and expansion of the vapor phase causes rapidly decreasing solubility of the vapor - transported metals ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ) , as confirmed by their very low contents in high - temperature but atmospheric - pressure fumaroles ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) .
Indeed , the tops of porphyry intrusions may be subjected to at least four distinct alteration - mineralization events , commencing with potassic and ending with advanced argillic , as temperature fronts retreat downward ( Fig . 14 ) .
Elsewhere , however , lower temperature quartz - kaolinite is the dominant overprint assemblage ( e . g . , Caspiche , northern Chile ) .
Nevertheless , in some porphyry Cu deposits , these halo metals , particularly Zn , occur as late - stage veinlet arrays overprinting the Cu - dominated cores rather than peripherally ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
The Cu / Au ratios of lithocap - hosted , highsulfidation mineralization tend to decrease upward , with the result that most major high - sulfidation Au ( ± Ag ) deposits occur in the shallow parts of lithocaps , commonly - but not always - with their tops immediately below the former paleowater table positions ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration event ( s ) that affect the early and intermineral porphyries and their immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric but possibly containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .

However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .

Exceptionally ferrous Fe - rich rocks , relatively uncommon in most arc terranes , also appear to assist with development of high hypogene Cu grades as well as maximizing the wall rock - hosted component of the deposit ( e . g . , El Teniente , Resolution , Oyu Tolgoi ) .
They commonly occur as tabular veins overprinting porphyry Cu deposits , like those at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) , Escondida ( Ojeda , 1986 ) , Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , and Collahuasi , northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Nevertheless , in many porphyry Cu deposits , it is fluid cooling over the ~ 550º to 350 °C range , assisted by fluid - rock interaction , that is largely responsible for precipitation of the Cu , in low sulfidation - state Cu - Fe sulfide assemblages , plus any Au ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The large size of some porphyry Cu systems , with maximum radii of ~ 8 km ( e . g . , Fig . 9 ) and maximum areal extents approaching 100 km 2 ( Singer et al . , 2008 ) , complicates their effective exploration because attention is unavoidably focused on the more prominently altered parts , such as pyrite - bearing porphyry Cu mineralization , pyrite halos , and pyrite - rich lithocaps .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

At the district scale , porphyry Cu systems and their contained deposits tend to occur as clusters or alignments that may attain 5 to 30 km across or in length , respectively .

The legend explains the temporal sequence of rock types , with the porphyry stock predating maardiatreme emplacement , which in turn overlaps lithocap development and phreatic brecciation .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous or siliciclastic wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .

Locally , however , the intermediate - sulfidation and both Cor dilleran lode and shallow , disseminated high - sulfidation mineralization types display transitional mineralogic relationships , as exemplified by the so - called Main Stage veins at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) and the disseminated A and Link Au zones at Wafi - Golpu ( Leach , 1999 ; Ryan and Vigar , 1999 )
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions in early quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .

( 3 ) how important are mafic magmas in the development of the parental magma chambers beneath porphyry Cu systems , and what material contributions do they make to the systems themselves ?
There , distinction from phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias may be difficult because of texture obliteration caused by intense advanced argillic alteration ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ) .

Volumes of the different alteration types vary markedly from deposit to deposit .
In such situations , the advanced argillic alteration may be 1 to > 2 m . y .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Lateral transfer of such liquids beyond lithocaps to form intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits is also dependent on the existence of suitable permeability , which in a few cases is the direct continuation of that utilized by the contiguous high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Colquijirca , Tintic ) .
( 12 ) why do only a few lithocaps appear to develop intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits on their peripheries ?
It may be speculated that crustal compression aids development of large mid - to upper - crustal magma chambers ( Takada , 1994 ) capable of efficient fractionation and magmatic fluid generation and release , especially at times of rapid uplift and erosional unroofing ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) , events which may presage initiation of stress relaxation ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au ± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .

The abovecited examples of mineralogic transitions between high - and intermediate - sulfidation mineralization provide support for this mechanism .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits , typically with above - average Cu tenors .

They are distinguished from the phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias by several features ( Table 1 ) , particularly the absence of tuffaceous material .
At several localities , the advanced argillic alteration at the bottoms of lithocaps displays a characteristic patchy texture , commonly defined by amoeboid pyrophyllite patches embedded in silicified rock ( e . g . , Escondida and Yanacocha ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ) .
Irrespective of whether the Cu - bearing sulfide minerals are coprecipitated with veinlet quartz or , as generally seems to be the case , introduced paragenetically later ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2001Redmond et al . , , 2004 , a particularly strong correlation exists between quartz veinlet intensity and metal content in many porphyry Cu deposits , particularly in Au - rich examples ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
in the case of long - lived porphyry Cu systems , whereas elsewhere the loci of intrusive and hydrothermal activity migrate , either systematically or randomly , to give rise to the porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposit clusters and alignments discussed above .
By the time that the late - mineral porphyry phases are added to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , fluid ascent from the parental magma chambers has all but ceased , and K and metal availability is too limited to generate appreciable potassic alteration and mineralization .
The existence of even minor erosional remnants of steam - heated horizons and their chalcedonic bases , generated above and at paleowater tables , respectively , guarantees that the appropriate near - surface level is preserved ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Simplified sections through high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits to illustrate the wide variation in alteration zoning patterns and their relationship to porphyry intrusions and Cu tenor .
The immediately premineral , early porphyries and their contiguous host rocks contain the highest grade mineralization in most deposits although , exceptionally , the earliest phase can be poorly mineralized ( e . g . , Grasberg ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ) .

However , if the overprinted high - sulfidation assemblages also contain appreciable arsenical sulfosalts , a situation that becomes increasingly likely upward in most systems , the resultant mineralization is less desirable because it is not only refractory if subjected to bacterial heap leaching but also generates As - rich flotation concentrates that may prove difficult to market .

Coalescence of closely spaced porphyry Cu deposits enhances size potential ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ) Development of wall rock - hosted orebodies alongside porphyry Cu deposits is most common where receptive carbonate rocks are present ( Fig . 6 ) .
High water contents result in magmas becoming saturated with the aqueous phase , into which the ore metals can partition efficiently ; and high oxidation state suppresses magmatic sulfide , such as pyrrhotite , precipitation , a process that may cause sequestration of metals before they can partition into the aqueous phase .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au and , less commonly , distal Au and / or Zn - Pb skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .

A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al .

Whether or not these and other deposit clusters and alignments owe their existence to fundamental faults or lineaments ( see above ; Richards , 2000 ) , it is often not obvious if exploration - commonly focused on areas of pre - or postmineral cover - should target broadly equidimensional deposit arrays or arc - parallel or arc - transverse alignments , particularly when only one or two deposits have been defined .
Notwithstanding the ubiquity of porphyry Cu belts , major deposits may also occur in isolation or at least as distant outliers of coherent belts and provinces ( e . g . , Pebble in Alaska , Butte in Montana , and Bingham in Utah ; Sillitoe , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) .
This situation implies that the underlying parental plutons have protracted life spans , albeit intermittent in some cases , with porphyry Cu formation taking place above them at different places over time .
Light stable isotope studies of sodic - calcic alteration in the Yerington district support the involvement of externally derived brine from the host sedimentary sequence , although the albite - actinolite alteration there is magnetite destructive ( Carten , 1986 ; .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .

If this scenario is correct , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity ( 5−20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Therefore , recognition of even weakly developed mineralization of a single type may help to direct exploration for potentially higher grade mineralization of other types elsewhere in the system .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .

Narrow , mineralogically complex quartz - sericite - K - feldspar - biotite veinlets with centimeterscale halos defined by the same minerals ( ± andalusite ± corundum ) along with abundant , finely disseminated chalcopyrite ± bornite characterize the changeover from group 1 to 2 veinlets in a few deposits , although they may have been confused elsewhere with D - type veinlets because of their eye - catching halos ; they are termed early dark micaceous ( EDM ) halo veinlets at Butte ( Meyer , 1965 ; Brimhall , 1977 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) and Bingham ( Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and type 4 ( T4 ) veinlets at Los Pelambres ( Atkinson et al . , 1996 ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) .

The A - type veinlets range from stockworks to subparallel , sheeted arrays , the latter particularly common in Au - rich porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
There is a strong suggestion that comagmatic volcanism may be inhibited in some major porphyry Cu belts as a result of their characteristic contractional tectonic settings , as in the FIG .
Mining and deep drilling in a few large porphyry Cu deposits show that mineralized intrusions have vertical extents of > 2 km ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida , northern Chile , and Grasberg ) and , based on evidence from the steeply tilted systems , perhaps ≥4 km ( Dilles , 1987 ; Seedorff et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity of veining , alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .

However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .

However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large , albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .

This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature , pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .

Where steeply dipping , receptive carbonate rock sequences abut steep porphyry stock contacts , vertically extensive proximal skarn bodies may form ( e . g . , the > 1 , 600 - m extent of the Ertsberg East ( Gunung Bijih ) Cu - Au deposit , Indonesia ; Coutts et al . , 1999 ) .
In a minority of cases , however , diatremes ( e . g . , Grasberg , Galore Creek , and Boyongan - Bayugo , Philippines ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Enns et al . , 1995 ; Braxton et al . , 2008 ) or tuff - filled depressions presumably fed by one or more subjacent diatremes ( e . g . , Resolution ) are early features that act as receptive wall rocks to the main alteration and mineralization .
At the early stage ( left side ) , magma is present at the top of the parental chamber , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid exits the magma and undergoes phase separation during ascent to generate immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor , which generate potassic alteration plus contained low sulfidation - state porphyry Cu ± Au mineralization .
The empirical relationship between well - established magmatic ( including postcollisional ) arcs containing major , highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits and contractional tectonic settings characterized by high surface uplift and denudation rates ( see above ) may prove to be a useful criterion for selection of underexplored arc segments with incompletely tested potential . Contractional settings are strongly suggested where entire arc segments possess only minor volcanic rock volumes contemporaneous with the development of porphyry Cu systems , particularly where lithocaps are widely preserved as evidence for shallow erosion .
The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size , grade , and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems .
The clustering or alignment of both porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits has been shown time and again to be a highly effective exploration concept .
Nevertheless , it also characterizes the centrally located zones of some porphyry Cu stocks ( e . g . , Koloula , Solomon Islands and Island Copper , British Columbia ; Chivas , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995 ; Arancibia and Clark , 1996 ) .
Furthermore , even where appreciable Au is retained in chlorite - sericite assemblages , flotation recoveries are commonly lower ( < 60 % ) than for ore from potassic zones ( > 80 % ) because some of the Au originally in solid solution and encapsulated in and attached to chalcopyrite ± bornite becomes linked to introduced pyrite ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
The alteration - mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren , early sodic - calcic through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic , to advanced argillic , the last of these constituting the lithocaps , which may attain > 1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion .
They span a range of compositions from calc - alkaline diorite and quartz diorite through granodiorite to quartz monzonite ( monzogranite ) , and alkaline diorite through monzonite to , uncommonly , syenite ( e . g . , Galore Creek , British Columbia ; Enns et al . , 1995 ) .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , skarn Cu ± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts with less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .

It also needs to be emphasized that few porphyry Cu systems , whatever their exposure level , contain the full spectrum of potential ore types depicted in Figure 6 , although the Bingham district with its porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and sediment - hosted Au deposits ( Babcock et al . , 1995 ) and the more shallowly exposed Lepanto district with its porphyry Cu - Au , high - sulfidation Cu - Au - Ag , and intermediate - sulfidation Au - Ag - Cu deposits ( Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) are exceptionally well endowed in this regard .

Varied relationships are observed between porphyry Cu systems and precursor plutons , which are typically multiphase , equigranular intrusions , commonly of batholithic dimensions and dioritic to granitic compositions ; they are not only spatially , but also temporally and probably genetically related to porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au formation ( Fig . 4 ) .
At the deposit scale , particularly in the por - phyry Cu environment , early - formed features commonly , but by no means always , give rise to the best ore - bodies .

The main geochemical difference between the Cu - Au zones in porphyry Cu deposits and those in the overlying lithocaps is the elevated As ( ± Sb ) contents consequent upon the abundance of the Cu sulfosalts in the latter .
This scenario implies episodic but focused magma and fluid ascent for as long as ~ 5 m . y .
Current orthodoxy maintains that the early sodic - calcic alteration observed in some porphyry Cu deposits is a product of inflowing brine sourced from host - rock sequences ( Carten , 1986 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005Seedorff et al . , , 2008 , in keeping with theoretical predictions for fluids following heating paths under silicate - rock−buffered conditions ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1984Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Under these lower temperature conditions , sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration zones begin to form from a deeply derived , single - phase aqueous liquid generated by one or both of the methods ( see text ) postulated by and Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) .

The fluid most likely to lead to appreciable high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu mineralization in the relatively barren , earlyformed lithocaps is the low - to moderate - salinity , H 2 S - rich , aqueous liquid that produces the underlying sericitic zones Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Where telescoping is limited , however , the lithocaps and potassic - altered porphyry stocks may be separated by 0 . 5 to 1 km ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , a gap typically occupied by pyritic chlorite - sericite alteration ( Fig . 11 ) .
Locally , early A - type veinlets displaying aplitic centers or along - strike transitions to aplite and / or aplite porphyry ( vein dikes ) are observed ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Heithersay et al . , 1990 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .

In the more highly telescoped systems , where sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages overprint appreciable volumes of potassic and / or chlorite - sericite alteration within porphyry intrusions , the ensuing effects can be varied .
These transverse features , possibly reflecting underlying basement structures , may facilitate ascent of the relatively small magma volumes involved in porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , Clark , 1993 ; Richards , 2000 ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich , Mopoor porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
( 11 ) what is the fluid regime responsible for metal zoning in lithocaps , and why are so many lithocaps apparently barren ?
Group 1 and 2 veinlets are mainly emplaced during potassic alteration , whereas group 3 accompanies the chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and deep advanced argillic overprints .
Open - space filling is also uncommon , except in phreatic breccias and unusual , isolated veins ( e . g . , La Mejicana alunite - pyrite - famatinite vein at Nevados del Famatina ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , exploration should focus first around their peripheries in case a porphyry Cu deposit has already been exposed .
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles are dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .

The same situation is also apparent in several giant high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits generated in thickened crust during tectonic uplift , such as Pascua - Lama and Veladero , northern Chile - Argentina , where the near absence of contemporaneous volcanism is more certain ( Bissig et al . , 2001 ; Charchaflié et al . , 2007 ) given the much shallower erosion level , including partial paleosurface preservation ( see below ) .

Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias display a variety of textures ( Table 1 ) , which are mainly dependent on clast form and composition , clast / matrix ratio , matrix / cement constitution , and alteration type .
Therefore recognition of A - and B - type veinlets in sericitic or advanced argillic zones testifies unambiguously to the former presence of potassic alteration .
Even cursory inspection of Figure 6 shows clearly that erosion level is a fundamental control on the mineralization types that may be anticipated to occur in porphyry Cu systems .
Note scale difference between c and a , b , and d . The precursor plutons are considered as the mid - to uppercrustal crystallization sites of mafic to felsic magmas that ascended from deeper reservoirs before porphyry Cu systems were developed ( see Richards , 2003 ) .
( 9 ) what are the main mechanisms controlling the bulk Cu / Au / Mo ratios of porphyry Cu deposits ?
At first glance , using representative cross sections of alteration at four highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits as examples ( Fig . 15 ) , these varied geometries are not easy to relate to a standard geologic model .
Note the common absence of B - and D - type veinlets from Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks and M - , magnetite - bearing A - , and chlorite - rich veinlets from Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Renewed neutralization of this same liquid on exiting the lithocap and / or aliquots of the deep liquid that bypass the lithocap entirely may give rise to peripheral intermediate - sulfidation ( IS ) epithermal mineralization .
As a consequence , the most distal and subtle ore types , sediment - hosted Au on the fringes of carbonate rockhosted districts and Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au−bearing intermediatesulfidation epithermal veins and carbonate - replacement bodies on the fringes of lithocaps attract less attention and may be easily missed .
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that certain lithologic units may enhance grade development in both porphyry Cu and related deposit types .
The early , intermineral , and late - mineral phases of the porphyry Cu stocks , which span the interval during which the porphyry Cu deposits formed , originate from increasingly greater depths in the progressively crystallizing parental chamber .
Field observations and theoretical calculations suggest that parental chambers with volumes on the order of 50 km 3 may be capable of liberating enough fluid to form porphyry Cu deposits , but chambers at least an order of magnitude larger are needed to produce giant systems , particularly where deposit clusters or alignments exist ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The degree of overprinting is perhaps best appreciated in some magmatichydro thermal breccia bodies in which isolated magnetite aggregates occur as stranded remnants in sericitic or chloritesericite zones up to 1 km above the magnetite - cemented , potassic parts ( e . g . , Chimborazo , northern Chile ; Fig . 8 ) .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high temperatures and oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .

Nevertheless , several temporally discrete porphyry Cu - bearing arcs may be superimposed on PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS 5 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 A preeminent example of spatial and temporal coincidence between a porphyry Cu belt and an intra - arc fault zone : the northern Chile part of the central Andean middle Eocene to early Oligocene porphyry Cu belt and Domeyko fault system ( summarized from Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit , northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Furthermore , there seems to be no obvious relationship between the size of porphyry Cu deposits and the duration of the intrusive activity , the latter seemingly being the main parameter defining the total hydrothermal life spans of porphyry Cu systems .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite ± chalcocite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .

Isotopic dating , using the U - Pb zircon method , suggests that the multiphase porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu systems can be assembled in as little as 80 , 000 years ( Batu Hijau , Indonesia ; Garwin , 2002 ) , but the process commonly takes much longer .
It is unlikely coincidental that at least half the ore at three of the highest grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits is hosted by such rocks : a gabbro - diabase - basalt complex at El Teniente ( Skewes et al . , 2002 ) , a Proterozoic diabase sill complex at Resolution , Arizona ( Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) , and a tholeiitic basalt sequence in the Oyu Tolgoi district .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .

Arranged from probable oldest ( top ) to youngest ( bottom ) , except for propylitic that is lateral equivalent of potassic ; advanced argillic also forms above potassic early in systems ( Fig . 10 ) 3 Many veinlets in potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alteration contain anhydrite , which also occurs as late , largely monomineralic veinlets particularly , advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2002 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ) .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large , high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; Perelló et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Perelló , 2006 ) .

However , at the shallower depths typical of most deposits ( < ~ 4 km ) , the mineralization is introduced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction of hypersaline liquid ( brine ) and a much larger volume of lowdensity vapor ( Fournier , 1999 ) , produced by either direct exsolution from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more typically , as the single - phase liquid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Cline , 1995 ) .
And these geologic observations must further emphasize the relative timing of intrusion , brecciation , alteration , and mineralization events because isotopic dating techniques do not and may never have the required resolution .

Some investigators emphasize the importance of intersections between continentscale transverse fault zones or lineaments and arc - parallel structures for porphyry Cu formation , with the Archibarca and Calama - El Toro lineaments of northern Chile ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 2 ) , the Lachlan Transverse Zone of New South Wales ( Glen and Walshe , 1999 ) , comparable features in New Guinea ( Corbett , 1994 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , and the much wider ( 160 km ) Texas lineament of southwestern North America ( Schmitt , 1966 ) being oft - quoted examples .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .

However , USTs are not consistently developed and , hence , do not provide a reliable means of subdividing porphyry Cu intrusion phases .
Modified from Sillitoe ( 1995bSillitoe ( , 1999bSillitoe ( , 2000 . impermeable seals around and / or above porphyry Cu deposits , resulting in high - grade ore formation ( e . g . , Grasberg ; Sillitoe , 1997 ) .
However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Irrespective of whether the porphyry Cu systems and contained deposits define clusters or alignments , their surface distributions are taken to reflect the areal extents of either underlying parental plutons or cupolas on their roofs .
range from restricted veneers near the stock or dike contacts to kilometer - scale zones , such as those in the mafic host lithologic units mentioned previously at El Teniente , Resolution , and Oyu Tolgoi .
But more fundamentally , however , we require better and more detailed documentation of geologic relationships in porphyry Cu systems worldwide , at all scales from the thin section to the entire system , and with greater emphasis on the regional to district context , particularly the relationship to igneous evolution .
Note that the high - grade ( > 1 . 5 % Cu ) zone at Chuquicamata includes a substantial , but unquantified , contribution from supergene enrichment .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .

The Bingham , Island Copper , and Agua Rica , Argentina , porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are exceptions to this generalization because of their deep , centrally located molybdenite zones ( John , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995Perelló et al . , , 1998 .
Nevertheless , many systems contain only one or two deposit types rather than a full zonal array ( Table 3 ) , with the presence of the more distal ore types at either porphyry Cu or lithocap levels being independent of the size and grade of the porphyry Cu deposits or prospects .
Notwithstanding the typical occurrence model depicted in Figure 6 and taking into account the critical importance of erosion level , the innumerable variations on the porphyry Cu genetic theme result in a broad spectrum of three - dimensional intrusion , breccia , alteration , and mineralization geometries ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
It is acquisition of this geologic detail that is going to enable better application of laboratory techniques and , hopefully , further clarify the localization and evolutionary histories of porphyry Cu systems as well as the fundamental controls on large size and high hypogene grade .
For example , the 12 . 5 - Gt resource at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic is confined to the 14 - km - long stock referred to above ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Camus , 2003 ) , whereas perhaps only roughly 20 percent of the similarly sized El Teniente deposit and < 10 percent of the 1 . 5 - Gt El Abra deposit are hosted by the porphyry intrusions ( Camus , 1975 ( Camus , , 2003Ambrus , 1977 ) .
To date , the second choice could be taken to have been less successful , as shown by the lack of economically significant discoveries in the vicinities of the major but isolated Bingham , Butte , Pebble , and Oyu Tolgoi districts , although greenfield exploration is in its infancy in the still poorly defined magmatic arcs that host the last two of these .
Porphyry deposits supply most of the world ' s Cu and Mo resources .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .

Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations , forming sulfur - undersaturated magmas that can further assimilate sulfides during ascent .
Copper , Mo and Au act as incompatible elements in sulfide undersaturated magmas , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently , driving the oxidation potential of sulfate up to the hematite - magnetite oxygen fugacity ( HM ) buffer , which is ~ ΔFMQ + 4 .
Degassing of oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .

Sulfide formed during sulfate reduction is efficiently scavenged by aqueous fluids , which transports metals to shallower depths , i . e . , the top of the porphyry and superjacent wallrock .

Porphyry deposits are hosts to one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , accounting for ~ 80 % Cu and ~ 95 % Mo of the world ' s total reserves .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability of minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Oxygen fugacity is of critical importance for the behaviors of elements .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .

Sulfates , including anhydrite and alunite ( likely related to the epithermal mineralization ) are abundant in the mineralization system , and hematite formed during chlorite alteration , indicating high oxygen fugacity up to the HM buffer ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Porphyry Au deposits have oxygen fugacities similar to , if not higher than , porphyry Cu deposits .
El Teniente is a nested porphyry system that , according to different authors , was active for ~ 1 Ma ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Cannell et al . , 2003 ) up to more than 7 Ma ( 14 . 2 - 6 . 5 Ma ) ( Barra , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2011 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .

Gangue minerals include quartz , muscovite , chlorite , calcite , minor epidote and anhydrite .
Hematite is also found in fluid inclusions in Dexing ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) .
Adakites found in the Qulong deposit are mixtures of continental and slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating shows that the formation ages of deposits within the Yulong ore belt range from 41 . 2 to 36 . 9 Ma , extending over a period of similar to 4 . 3 Ma , with formation ages decreasing systematically from northwest to southeast ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .

Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , the behaviors of which are mainly controlled by reduced sulfur , e . g . , sulfide , hydrosulfide complexes ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or polysulfide ( e . g . , S 2 2− , S 3 − ) complexes ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Sulfur oxidation , sulfide under saturation and residual sulfide
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts formed at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 and ΔFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Slab melts formed at ΔFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ΔFMQ 0 ) .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Sulfate reduction
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation during magma chamber development may be better mixed and more homogenized .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

Oxygen fugacity of Manus glasses was calculated using the following equa - ( Kress and Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Hydrogen may further react with CO 2 and / or O 2 ( Eqs .
Pure hydrothermal hematite and specularite can often be determined to have formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , the specularite occurring in late stage veins at Dexing ( Fig . 13 ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .

Reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are : 17 Mile Hill , Western Australia ; the Minãs de San Anton , Mexico ( Rowins , 2000 ) ; the Baogutu , northwestern China ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010aShen et al . , , 2012 ; North Fork Deposit , west Central Cascades , western North America ( Smithson and Rowins , 2005 ) ; Catface ; Vancouver Island , British Columbia ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; and a few other small porphyry deposits ( Rowins , 2000 ) .

Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Ridge subduction forms oxidized adakites by slab melting ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Ling et al . , 2009Ling et al . , , 2013 , followed by reduced A - type granites ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; H . Li et al . , 2012 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1994 ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
crystallizes below 950 °C in silicic calc - alkaline magmas ( Green and Watson , 1982 ) .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Low - salinity vapor shows strong seawater signals , which cannot represent " degassing " fluids .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .

Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .

Magnetite crisis
Fluid extraction , however , is different from degassing , and thus Se provides no constraints on the process .

Oxygen fugacity and open systems
Sulfides formed through sulfate reduction are released into magmatic fluids , where they scavenge chalcophile elements Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Hydrothermal magnetite and even hematite may also form in fluids released from arc volcanic magmas , e . g . , Manus glasses , releasing H + .
Metals can be leached out as far as there is enough water circulation .
Adakite , slab melting , ridge subduction and porphyry Cu deposits
Adakite was initially named for rocks formed through partial melting of subducted young oceanic crust ( b25 Ma , represented by midocean ridge basalt , MORB ) ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Kay , 1978 ) .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Fractional crystallization of garnet and / or amphibole plays no positive role in Cu mineralization , either ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
Adakite formation through slab melting , on the other hand , does favor porphyry Cu mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) .

Oceanic crust has a much higher Cu abundance ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than the mantle ( 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) or the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Normal arc rocks form by partial melting of peridotite from the mantle wedge .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Alterations
Porphyry deposits have very well developed alteration zones that typically affect several cubic kilometers of rock ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Titley , 1981 ) ( Fig . 30 ) , which is of critical importance to understanding porphyry mineralization processes and improving their exploration .
Alteration is mainly controlled by pH values of the ore - forming fluids ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

At higher oxygen fugacity , no residual sulfides can be expected unless there is additional sulfur added from the subducting slab , which in actuality is probably the case .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
In highly oxidized porphyry magmas , sulfate , CO 2 and H 2 O are the dominant species , which are already oxidized and thus cannot reduce sulfate to sulfide , leaving ferrous iron as the only probable reducing agent ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
In magma system , this is better described as oxidation of FeO by sulfate or another oxidant ( Eq .
In fluids , the reactions can be described by Eqs .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .

The S abundance in the primitive mantle is estimated to be about 200 - 250 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , and about 150 ppm in depleted mantle ( Lorand , 1990 ; Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .

For slab melts formed at melting degrees higher than that require for SCSS , they would be undersaturated in sulfide and thus could assimilate more sulfides and chalcophile elements from the surrounding mantle while ascending , depending on the partitioning relationships between melt and residual sulfide in the mantle .

The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The Catface porphyry may have ascended through and interacted with graphite - rich reducing country rock known to exist in the region ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .

The H isotopes of fluid inclusions from Baogutu have very low δD values ( Shen et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , which are much lower than for either magmatic fluids or metamorphic fluids ( Fig . 21 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The systematically lighter H coupled with a slightly lighter O can best be explained by the addition of meteoritic water .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The total iron ( expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) content ranges from 2 . 25 wt . % to 5 . 53 wt . % for the Catface porphyry .
One carbon atom reduces 4 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .

HDP = hornblende diorite porphyry ; GDP = Granodiorite porphyry ; D = diorite .
Many epithermal deposits , however , are not linked to porphyry deposits .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
If the magma at Catface was reduced during degassing of SO 3 , there should be compositional zonation in the apatite , which is not the case ( Fig . 20 ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Normal arc melts are not systematically more enriched in Cu than MORB , either ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .
All the sulfate reduction reactions provide S 2 − , which promotes mineralization , forming chalcopyrite ( Eq .

Given that ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization , the highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic high potassium intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .

Instead of primary hematite , magnetite , and sulfate ( e . g . , anhydrite , gypsum ) that are frequently seen in oxidized porphyries , these " reduced " porphyry Cu - Au deposits contain abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and commonly have carbonic - rich ore fluids with substantial proportions of CH 4 , clearly indicating a reducing condition ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Most of the ferric Fe will be transferred into the melt because ferric Fe is more incompatible than ferrous Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .

Because the anhydrite - rich stock is isotopically similar to all the other igneous rocks of the late Miocene deposit ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) formed at a time of regional compressive deformation , it has been proposed that an oxidized parent magma in the large productive magma chamber was undergoing igneous fractionation at that time .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content at sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .

Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .

Formation of reduced porphyry deposits
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Therefore , S - Pb isotopes cannot place any decisive constraints on the role of assimilation in forming the deposit .

The grades of porphyry Cu and Au deposits associated with reduced magmas are comparable to , if not higher than , those associated with oxidized magmas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rowins , 2000 ) .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

Nevertheless , porphyry deposits are usually mineralized in the whole upper portion of the pluton , whereas interactions with country rocks are generally restricted at the interface , therefore assimilation of reducing sediments is not likely to be a decisive controlling process .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .

Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .

Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Nevertheless , assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries would result in heterogeneous reduction , because reduction is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .

Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
In fact , most Cu should have come from slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , as also should have come the S and Pb , which are present in abundances similar to mantle derived magmas .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Therefore , the parental Catface magmas may have acquired a low fO 2 during their ascent through the crust .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Moreover , most mantle minerals olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Moreover , the crystallization of amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
There are also several ridges ( most of which are aseismic , i . e . , island chains ) on the western Pacific plate ( Fig . 28 ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .

Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large amount of Cu .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Moreover , some porphyry deposits are apparently associated with reduced magmas at ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Intergrowths of hematite and magnetite ( Fig . 10 ) indicate the oxygen fugacity of Qulong reached the HM buffer .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
In contrast , at oxygen fugacity even only slightly lower , e . g . , ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , the highest Cu contents that can be reached through slab melting is ~ 450 ppm .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Therefore , the reduced Catface porphyry is likely to be a country rock that only hosts the deposit .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .

Based on similar Zn / Fe T ratios of mantle peridotite and primitive arc magmas , it has been argued that primary arc magmas are not necessarily oxidized ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
Considering the geotherm ' s concave downward shape of subducting slabs , ridge subduction is the most favorable tectonic setting for slab melting in the Phanerozoic .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .

Shapinggou . The Shapinggou porphyry Mo deposit is the largest
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
When there is no residual sulfide in the mantle source , Cu and also other chalcophile elements become highly incompatible ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .

There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .

Also shown is the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , thick horizontal orange line ; NNO and FMQ , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .

Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
In contrast , the oceanic plates subducting underneath the western North American continent are younger and have experienced only one Ocean Anoxic Event .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains the Au - rich capping feature of many reduced porphyry deposits .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .

There are several subducting ridges along the east Pacific margin , e . g . , in Chile and Peru in the South America .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin - Mariana , and other arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .

In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with reduced magmas
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is followed by emplacement the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
The uniform and low SO 3 contents in apatite from reduced magma deposits were used to argue that the low oxygen fugacity of these porphyries is primary ( Fig . 20 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .

At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .

Stability domains of trisulfur ion S 3 − at total dissolved sulfur concentrations of 1 wt . % and 0 . 1 wt . % are shown .
It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Evidence for reduced magmas of Catface porphyry deposit
The formation of the Catface porphyry deposit
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .

There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
Experiments show that sulfate is much more soluble than sulfide in magmas .
Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
More accurately , the ferrous Fe in fluids reacts with water , releasing H 2 and H + ( Eq .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bΔFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ΔFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
This implies that such porphyry deposits themselves are not genetically related to reduced magmas , i . e . , they are not the causative magma , but the host rock .
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .

This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .

Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulﬁde .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .

The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .

In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration .

Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
They are associated with carbonic - rich ore forming fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , and multiple intrusive events ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 ≥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 ≥ 15 wt . % , Y ≤ 18 ppm , Yb ≤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr ≥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The question is again why normal arc rocks in compressed environments do not form porphyry deposits .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ΔFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayalite–magnetite– quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .

No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .

What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
Some workers proposed that ΔFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ΔFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
This is one reason why the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magma did not change much ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or even decrease slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( see also Section 5 ) .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .

One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .

It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Among them are degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .

Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .

As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .

It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .

It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .

Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .

( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate oxidation potential of sulfate .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ΔFMQ − 1 and 1500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .

This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has long been proposed that oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 have reached the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
More importantly , compared to oxidized magmas , reduced magmas indeed have lower sulfur contents with S 2− occurring as the dominant sulfur species ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , but this does not necessarily mean higher S 2− in reduced magmas as claimed by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .

Some experiments suggest that D Mo increases with decreasing oxygen fugacities ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ΔFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .

From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .

We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ﬂuids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For example , there are also many porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( without economic levels of Mo ) in the western American continents , including some of the world ' s top 25 largest porphyry deposits , e . g . , Cerro Casale in Chile ; Minas Conga in Peru ; Bajo de la Alumbrera in Argentina ; Pebble Copper in the USA ; and Prosperity in Canada .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .

More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
This can best be explained by the reduction of Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .

This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .

As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S at sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This is probably mainly because the crust in backarc basins is too thin .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .

It has long been proposed that most porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013b , also known as the magnetite - series magmas ( Ishihara and Terashima , 1989 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The addition of subduction released oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to arc magmas is proposed as the most straightforward way , e . g . , water ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , oxidizing fluids and / or melts ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) , fluids with oxidizing components , e . g . , hematite , sulfate ( X . M .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Baogutu is located in West Junggar , Central Asian Orogenic Belt , and is the second largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , with controlled reserves of 0 . 63 Mt Cu @ 0 . 28 wt . % , 14 t Au @ 0 . 1 ppm , 1 . 8 × 10 4 t Mo @ 0 . 011 wt . % and 390 t Ag @ 1 . 8 ppm ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
Previous studies suggested that these magmas are a product of continental arc - style magmatism ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
Some researchers have even argued that Cu comes from the mantle , whereas Mo comes from the continental crust ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .

Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .

Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
Experiments with apatite have shown that SO 3 contents reflect the oxygen fugacity of the magmas ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( ± Au and ± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher ε Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .

Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
A similar model has been proposed based on geochemical and mineralogical studies by Shen and Pan ( 2013 ) , in which mineral composition data suggest that the primary magma of the Baogutu porphyry deposit is oxidized .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
Therefore , it does not require very high oxygen fugacities to eliminate residual sulfides .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
It is not clear whether the portion of the subducting slab underneath Qulong was continental or oceanic .

( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction S 3 − ( Eq .
This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
We propose that the reduced features of the Baogutu porphyry deposit are secondary and occurred during emplacement , thus having no major influence on the mineralization process .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
It has also been proposed that degassing of SO 2 may lower the oxygen fugacity ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .

The most straightforward way to elevate the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is by the addition of oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to the magmas .

In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .

The geodynamic and architectural controls on porphyry formation in this complex tectonic zone are unclear ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .

Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
Similar to El Teniente , the formation of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposits also lasted for several million years , between 36 and 31 Ma ( Ballard et al . , 2001 ; Ossandon et al . , 2001 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This was interpreted as the main evidence for degassing ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .

This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .

Further studies are needed on the formation of Sar - Cheshmeh and other Cenozoic porphyry deposits in the belt .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
During a period of recharge by mantle - derived mafic magmas into the base of the chamber and associated volatile transfer and concentration near its roof , the opportunity arose to produce the Cu - and S - rich magmas that formed the anhydrite - bearing intrusive rocks ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

In principle , there are several ways to lower the oxygen fugacities during magma evolution .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .

Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values defined by the HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .

This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .

It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
This plausibly explains the common association between high - Mg adakites and porphyry Cu deposits .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .

As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
Degassing , however , is not likely to be a main process in porphyry mineralization that occurs at 2 - 4 km depths in the upper crust .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .

Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .

Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .

CH 4 þ 4Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 8FeO þ CO 2 þ 2H 2 Oð29Þ Considering that the Catface porphyry is not adakitic , it may well be simply the country rock that hosts the deposit .
All the samples with the exception of two were collected from the diorite , which are not porphyry at all .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .

It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaﬁei et al . , 2009 ) .
The orange field between HM and ΔFMQ + 2 is the optimum condition for porphyry Cu , Au , Mo mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
C þ 2Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 4FeO þ CO 2ð28Þ Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Based on the above discussion , we propose the following model for the formation of the Catface porphyry .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Potassic alteration is located in the center and deeper portions of the porphyry .
The problem with this model is that no studies have ever demonstrated that adakites are more hydrous than normal arc rocks .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
The distribution of porphyry deposits does not support the premise that the Cu comes from the mantle .
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It has been further proposed that in general geological processes where the tri - sulfur ion may have been involved need to be reconsidered ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , and this would require the investigation of different reaction pathways ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) ) together with alkali contents in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alteration ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
It is located in the western Dabie Mountains , along the east extension of the East Qinling Mo mineralization belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; H . Y .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .

This was attributed to sulfate buffering ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , i . e . , the oxidation of ferrous iron is coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide ( Eqs .

This process , however , was excluded from further consideration based on the low 87 Sr / 86 Sr of Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .

Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , subduction of reducing sediments is not a plausible explanation for the low fO 2 shown by the Catface porphyry .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

It is located in southwestern Iran and is associated with several intrusive pulses of Miocene stocks ( ~ 12 . 2 Ma ) ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) , ranging in composition from diorite through granodiorite to quartzmonzonite ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2− ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2− ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
As pointed out by the authors , detailed studies are needed to clarify the origin of the CH 4 .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .

Because of these uncertainties , it has been asserted that there is no single , obvious reason why slab melts have an unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits ( Richards , 2013 ) .
Second , there is no systematic difference in terms of emplacement depths and tectonic settings between reduced and oxidized porphyry deposits .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .

The total resources there are estimated to be N1 . 8 billion tons , accounting for about 60 % of the world ' s total Cu resource estimation ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .

Their contribution depends heavily on subsequent oxidation , i . e . , a major contribution can be expected only when the sulfide cumulates are oxidized to sulfate , liberating the chalcophile elements .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

Nevertheless , the oxygen fugacity undoubtedly fluctuated during porphyry mineralization ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , and the hydrothermal rutile only records the oxygen fugacities under which it crystallized .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .

Consistently , the Mo / Cu ratios of these deposits are generally more than 20 times higher than the primitive mantle ratio value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , suggesting that Mo has been added to the porphyry deposits from different sources .

Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .

Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Porphyry Cu ore formation
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive δ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .

The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .

The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .

Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .

argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .

Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .

Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .
In contrast , deep crustal amphibolites are preserved in the lithosphere , and will be susceptible to partial melting at any later time due to thermal rebound or reheating by invading asthenospheric melts .

Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .

The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .

Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .

When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( Audétat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the Roşia Montană epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .

As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu ± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 °C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425° - 320 °C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .

Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .

Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .

These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3× ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .

( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .

Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .

Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400° - 500 °C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .

Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400° - 350 °C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 °C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .

In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .

Continental China is a mosaic of numerous tectonic blocks , which amalgamated from Neoarchean through Cenozoic broadly coeval with the cycles of global supercontinents such as Kenorland , Columbia , Rodinia , Gondwana , and Pangaea .
Superimposed orogeny has reworked the lithospheric structure with concomitant granitoid - associated metallogeny .
The mixing of magmas from juvenile lower crust , ancient lower crust , and middle crust , which tends to induce the different mineralization of Cu–Au , Mo , and Pb–Zn–W–Sn deposits , was considered to generate a wide variety of combinations of metal species .
The stratiform ore deposit , including BIF , VMS , and SEDEX , or sedimentary sulfide layers formed from Neoarchean to Paleozoic were modified by later mineralization , resulting in the enrichment of the various metal species and enhancement of ore resources .
The composite metallogenic system was dominantly characterized by the multi - episodic and diverse mineralization concomitant with one or more features including mineralization evolved from the previous metal enrichment , later overlap of ore deposit , and diversifying of metal species derived from 2 GR Focus Review reworked lithosphere .
Continental China is located at the junction of the Central Asian orogenic belt , Tethyan orogenic belt and the oceanic subduction zone of the Pacific plate ( Ren et al . , 2013 ; ) ( Fig . 1a ) . China is a collage of cratons and fragmental continental blocks and arcs , welded by multiple ophiolitic mélange .

The NE China microcontinental Block was affected by the Mongol - Okhotsk suture ( Fig . 1 ) to the north and the Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) to the south in Permo - Triassic ( Fig . 1 ) .
The Mongol - Okhotsk suture stretches along the southeastern boundary of the Siberian Craton over 3000 km , extending from the present - day Udsky gulf of the Okhotsk Sea to the Khangay mountain range in Central Mongolia ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) .
The Solonker suture ( [ 22 ] ) separates the Cathaysian flora province with tropical Permian floras in the south from the Angaran flora province with cool , temperate species in the north .
The Paleo - Tethyansutures in the Tibet and Sanjiangorogenic belts are characterized by several sub - parallel ophiolite complexes , composed of peridotites , gabbros , MORB - type basalts , and radiolarian cherts , juxtaposed with the subduction zone assemblage of UHP metamorphic rocks , arc magmatic rocks , and post - subduction S - type pluton .

The closure of Mianlue ocean started first in the Dabie region and migrated westward ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . 2006 ) from the Early Permian and to Middle - Late Triassic , causing the formation of Mianlue suture ( [ 26 ] ) .
Calcic to calcalkaline Permian - Triassic magmatic rocks are widespread in the East Kunlun ( [ 15 ] ) formed during the subduction - related orogenic period and the subsequent syn - to post - collision stage ( Yin and Harrison , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2015a ) .
The Sulu - Dabie high - to ultrahigh - pressure ( HP - UHP ) metamorphic belt ( [ 21 ] ) formed during the Triassic collision between the North China Craton and Yangtze Craton ( Li et al . , 2000 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2011b ; Deng et al . , 2014c ) .
The main metamorphic rocks in this belt include garnet peridotite , garnet pyroxenite , eclogite , schist , quartzite , marble , and various gneisses ( Ratschbacher et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009b ; Zheng , et al . , 2009 ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating of paragneiss , orthogneiss , and eclogite from the Sulu belt indicate that the UHP peak metamorphic event took place at ~ 240 - 220Ma ( Fig . 1 ) , and then overprinted by amphibolite - facies retrograde metamorphic at ~ 220 - 210 Ma ( Liu et al . , 2004 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .
Biotite and muscovite Ar - Ar thermochronology of mylonitic gneiss from Sulu belt suggest that the UHP metamorphic rocks started to exhume at ~ 220 - 200 Ma ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Webb et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2006b ) .

Jurassic to Cretaceous subduction system
The Jurassic to Cenozoic subduction systems are developed both along southwestern and eastern margins of China .
Southward oceanic subduction of the Bangong - Nujiang Ocean from the Permian to the Early Cretaceous gave rise to extensive calc - alkaline magmatism on the northern margin of the Lhasa terrane ( Zhang et al . , 2012b ) .
The westward flat subduction of the Paleo - Pacific oceanic crust resulted in extensive late - Mesozoic magmatism dominantly along the eastern margin of China , named East Coast Arc ( [ 28 ] ) in this paper ( Fig . 1 ) .

These features of the sediments correspond to the anomalous metal enrichment , diverse accessory metals , and complex isotopic signature of the MVT ore deposits formed in Oligocene within basins .
This suture marks the final suture of the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( Zhang et al . , 2010a ; Wu et al . , 2000 ; Ge et al . , 2007 ) .
This was explained by mixing of a mantlederived magma with a granitic melt formed by magma underplating in the crust , which formed in the post - orogenic setting ( Wei et al . , 2013a ) .
This is inferred to relate to the increase of slab - dip angle of the Pacific oceanic plate subduction beneath southeastern China ( Zhou and Li , 2000 ) .

By reviewing the long - lasting geological evolution in the different tectonic blocks , it reveals that more than two episodes of tectonic events , including accretionary and collisional orogeny , and dismantling , as well as mantle plume , occurred successively or simultaneously within a single tectonic belt . . . .
The spatial overlap and complementary metal endowment during the previous subduction - and later collision - related magmatic events in the Lhasa block provide important insights into mineral potential .
H9 slate formed at 1505 ± 12 Ma and the H8 dolomite was deposited during the Mesoproterozoic ( Lai et al . , 2015 ) .
The tectonic history in the southern Tibet from 25 to 10 Ma suggests that as the underthrusting of continental lithosphere was initiated , the magmatic events tended to subside ( Chung et al . , 2005 ) .
Extensive researches have been carried out on the composition and evolution of orogenic belts , such as the Jiangnan belt in South China Block ( Zhu et al . , 2012c ; Li et al . , 2012a ) , the Central Asian orogenic belt ( Han et al . , 2010 ; Xu et al . , 2015b ) , the Qinling - Qilian - Kunlun belt ( Sun et al . , 2003 ; Wu and Zheng , 2013 ; Dong and Santosh ,

Typical hypogene porphyry Cu deposits have average grades of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent Cu , < 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 percent Mo , and 0 . 0× to 1 . 5 g / t Au , although a few " Auonly " deposits have Au tenors of 0 . 9 to 1 . 5 g / t but little Cu ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Porphyry Cu systems show a marked tendency to occur in linear , typically orogen - parallel belts , which range from a few tens to hundreds and even thousands of kilometers long , as exemplified by the Andes of western South America ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Fig . 2 ) and the Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt of Romania , Serbia , and Bulgaria ( Janković , 1977 ; Popov et al . , 2002 ) .

Deposit densities commonly attain 15 per 100 , 000 km 2 of exposed permissive terrane ( Singer et al . , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu belts developed during well - defined metallogenic epochs , which isotopic dating shows to have typical durations of 10 to 20 m . y .
Individual porphyry Cu belts are commonly spatially separate rather than superimposed on one another , reflecting arc migration as a result of steepening or shallowing of subducted slabs between the individual magmatic - metallogenic epochs ( e . g . , Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems are generated mainly in magmatic arc ( including backarc ) environments subjected to a spectrum of regional - scale stress regimes , apparently ranging from moderately extensional through oblique slip to contractional ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Strongly extensional settings , typified by compositionally bimodal basalt - rhyolite magmatism , lack significant porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1999a ; Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .
Large , high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits also form in similar contractional settings at the tops of tectonically thickened crustal sections , albeit not together with giant porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist 2003 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

Faults and fault intersections are invariably involved , to greater or lesser degrees , in determining the formational sites and geometries of porphyry Cu systems and their constituent parts .
Intra - arc fault systems , active before as well as during magmatism and porphyry Cu generation , are particularly important localizers , as exemplified by the Domeyko fault system during development of the preeminent middle Eocene to early Oligocene belt of northern Chile ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 , and references therein ; Fig . 2 ) .
Arc - parallel alignments may occur along intra - arc fault zones , as exemplified by the Chuquicamata district , northern Chile ( Fig . 3b ) whereas cross - arc fault zones or lineaments control arc - transverse alignments , as in the Cadia , New South Wales ( Fig . 3c ) and Oyu Tolgoi , Mongolia districts ( Fig . 3d ) .
Clusters or alignments of porphyry Cu systems can display a spread of formational ages , which attain as much as 5 m . y .
Outcropping precursor plutons normally represent the shallower , earlier consolidated parts rather than the magma volumes from which the fluids for porphyry Cu generation were derived ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu systems may be spatially associated with comagmatic , calc - alkaline or , less commonly , alkaline volcanic rocks , typically of intermediate to felsic composition ( Sillitoe , 1973 ; Fig . 4 ) , which are generally erupted subaerially 0 . 5 to 3 m . y .

Volcanic landforms are obviously even better preserved in the shallower high - sulfidation epithermal environment above porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , flow - dome complexes at Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ; e . g . , Fig . 6 ) .
Massive carbonate sequences , particularly where marble is developed near intrusive contacts , and other poorly fractured , fine - grained rocks have the capacity to act as relatively Serrano et al . , 1996 ; J . C . Toro , writ .
High - sulfidation epithermal deposits may be similarly blind , beneath a thick limestone sequence in the case of Pueblo Viejo .
Ferrous Fe - rich lithologic units also appear to favor highgrade porphyry Cu mineralization ( e . g . , Ray and Mineral Park , Arizona ; Phillips et al . , 1974 ; Wilkinson et al . , 1982 ) , presumably because of their capacity to effectively precipitate Cu transported in oxidized magmatic fluids ( see below ) .
Mineralization elsewhere in porphyry Cu systems may be even more profoundly influenced by rock type .
Large - tonnage , high - sulfidation epithermal deposits are favored by permeable rock packages , commonly pyroclastic or epiclastic in origin ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) , although disparate lithologic units can also prove receptive where extensively fractured ( e . g . , granitoid at Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Porphyry Cu deposits are centered on porphyry intrusions that range from vertical , pluglike stocks ( Fig . 6 ) , circular to elongate in plan , through dike arrays to small , irregular bodies .

Intermineral porphyries are typically less well mineralized as they become progressively younger , and late - and postmineral phases are barren .
Wall - rock xenoliths in the marginal parts of some porphyry intrusions may be sufficiently abundant to constitute intrusion breccias .
Mo - rich porphyry Cu deposits are normally tied to the more felsic intrusions , whereas Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits tend to be related to the more mafic end members , although intrusions as felsic as quartz monzonite may also host Au - rich examples ( e . g . , Mamut , East Malaysia ; Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ) .
Diatreme breccias have a distinctive texture , in which widely separated , typically centimeter - sized clasts are dominated by rock - flour matrix containing an andesitic to dacitic tuffaceous component ( Table 1 ) , the latter commonly difficult to recognize where alteration is intense .

Veinlet truncation , quartz veinlet xenoliths , chilled contacts , and flow - aligned phenocrysts as well as textural , grade , and metal - ratio variations may denote the porphyry contacts , albeit generally not all present at the same contact .
The late - mineral porphyry lacks veinlets and displays only propylitic alteration .
The breccia clasts may be set in rock - flour matrix , hydrothermal cement , fine - grained igneous material , or some combination of the three .
Igneous matrices tend to be more common at depth near the magmatic source , where the term igneous breccia is appropriately applied ( e . g . , Hunt et al . , 1983 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias , generally occupying steep , pipelike to irregular bodies , are commonly intermineral in timing as a result of being generated in close association with intermineral porphyry phases ( Figs . 6 , 8 ) .
Early breccias may display potassic alteration and have biotite , magnetite , and chalcopyrite cements , whereas later ones are commonly sericitized and contain prominent quartz , tourmaline , specularite , chalcopyrite , and / or pyrite as cementing minerals .
Sericitized breccia may change downward to potassic - altered breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Frikken et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 8 ) .
Phreatic breccias , as exemplified by pebble dikes , normally contain polymictic clast populations set in muddy , rock - flour matrices ( Table 1 ) .
The tops of the orebodies tend to be relatively abrupt and controlled by the apices of quartz veinlet stockworks ( see below ) .
The shape of any porphyry Cu orebody may undergo significant modification as a result of emplacement of late - to postmineral rock volumes ( e . g . , Fig . 5a ) , as exemplified by the low - grade cores caused by internal emplacement of latemineral porphyry phases ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Philippines ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) and , much less commonly , latestage diatremes ( e . g . , El Teniente ; Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Camus , 2003 ) .
Intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits , containing Zn - Pb - Ag ± Cu ± Au as well as Mn - bearing carbonates , rhodonite , and quartz , occur alongside lithocaps but typically spatially separate from the high - sulfidation orebodies , as observed in the case of the Victoria and Teresa vein systems at Lepanto ( Claveria , 2001 ; Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) and in the Collahuasi district ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Alteration - mineralization zoning in porphyry Cu deposits
Porphyry Cu deposits display a consistent , broad - scale alteration - mineralization zoning pattern that comprises , centrally from the bottom upward , several of sodic - calcic , potassic , chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and advanced argillic ( cf .
Chloritic and propylitic alteration develop distally at shallow and deeper levels , respectively ( Fig . 10 ) .
Phyllic ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ) and sericitic are synonyms .
Sericitic alteration may project vertically downward as an annulus separating the potassic and propylitic zones as well as cutting the potassic zone centrally as shown .
Sericitic alteration tends to be more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo deposits , whereas chlorite - sericite alteration develops preferentially in porphyry Cu - Au deposits .
Alteration - mineralization in the lithocap is commonly far more complex than shown , particularly where structural control is paramount .
Quartzalunite
Quartzkaolinite
Sodic - calcic alteration , commonly magnetite bearing ( Table 2 ) , is normally rather poorly preserved at depth in some porphyry Cu deposits , commonly in the immediate wall rocks to the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Panguna , Papua New Guinea and El Teniente ; Ford , 1978 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ) , a position that may give rise to confusion with propylitic alteration ( Fig . 10 ) .

Sodic - calcic alteration is typically sulfide and metal poor ( except for Fe as magnetite ) but can host mineralization in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Nugget Hill , Philippines ) , in some of which hybrid potassic - calcic ( biotite - actinolite - magnetite ) assemblages are also commonplace ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II , Ridgeway , and Cotabambas , southern Peru ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Wilson et al . , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004a ) .
Biotite is the predominant alteration mineral in relatively mafic porphyry intrusions and host rocks , whereas K - feldspar increases in abundance in more felsic , granodioritic to quartz monzonitic settings .
Sodic plagioclase may be an accompanying alteration mineral in both settings .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Chalcopyrite - bornite cores are transitional outward to chalcopyrite - pyrite annuli , which , with increasing sulfide contents , grade into pyrite halos , typically parts of the surrounding propylitic zones ( Table 2 ) .
Pyrrhotite may accompany the pyrite where reduced host rocks are present ( e . g . , Kósaka and Wakita , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 2003b ) .
Chlorite - sericite alteration ( Table 2 ) , giving rise to distinctive , pale - green rocks , is widespread in the shallower parts of some porphyry Cu deposits , particularly Au - rich examples , where it overprints preexisting potassic assemblages ( Figs . 10 , 11 ) .
Sericitic alteration ( Table 2 ) in porphyry Cu deposits normally overprints and wholly or partially destroys the potassic and chlorite - sericite assemblages ( Figs . 10−12 ) , although sericitic veinlet halos are zoned outward to chlorite - sericite alteration in places ( e . g . , .
Sericitic alteration may be subdivided into two different types : an uncommon , early variety that is greenish to greenish - gray in color and a later , far more common and widespread , white variety .

Distal Au skarns are typically more reduced ( pyroxene rich ) than their proximal counterparts ( Fortitude , Copper Canyon district ; Myers and Meinert , 1991 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits display single veinlet sequences that comply with the generalizations summarized above and ( Barr et al . , 1976 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2000Sillitoe , , 2002 .
Background alteration between veinlets is mainly potassic , which is likely to contain more K - feldspar in the Mo - rich than the Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .

PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS in Figure 13 and Table 2 , but repetitions of group 1 and 2 veinlets , for example , early biotite , EDM halo , and A types cut by lesser numbers of later EDM halo and A types ( e . g . , Bingham ; Redmond et al . , 2001 ) , occur where time gaps between porphyry phases are sufficiently large ; however , group 2 and 3 veinlets are only uncommonly repeated .
Magnetite ± actinolite ( M - type ) and quartz - magnetite ( Atype ) veinlets are far less common in Mo - than Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13 ) , the latter typified by particularly elevated hydrothermal magnetite contents , commonly attaining 5 to 10 vol percent ( Sillitoe , 1979 ( Sillitoe , , 2000MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Proffett , 2003 ) .

Anhydrite and tourmaline are prominent veinlet , brecciafilling , and alteration minerals in many porphyry Cu deposits ( Table 2 ) , including associated skarns .
Absence of anhydrite to depths of several hundred meters beneath the current surface in many porphyry Cu systems is normally due to supergene dissolution ( see Sillitoe , 2005 ) .

Tourmaline may occur in minor amounts in several veinlet types , even those formed early in deposit histories ( e . g . , T4 veinlets al Los Pelambres ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) , but it is most abundant with quartz and / or pyrite in D - type veinlet generations and any associated magmatic - hydrothermal breccias affected by sericitic alteration ( Fig . 8 ) .
Advanced argillic lithocaps
Original lithocaps have areal extents of several to > 10 and , locally , up to 100 km 2 and thicknesses of > 1 km , and hence are much more extensive than the underlying porphyry Cu deposits .
Most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , which may either wholly or partially overlie and conceal porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) or occur alongside them and , hence , above propylitic rock ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina , Argentina , Batu Hijau , and Rosia Poieni , Romania ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ; Clode et al . , 1999 ; Milu et al . , 2004 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components of many ledges .
Barite and native S are common late - stage components ledges .
Metal zoning in porphyry Cu systems is well documented , particularly at the deeper , porphyry Cu levels ( e . g . , Jerome , 1966 ; Titley , 1993 ) .
Gold grades may be up to ~ 50 percent higher in bornite - rich than chalcopyritedominated potassic assemblages , which has been explained by the experimental observation that bornite solid solution is capable of holding up to one order of magnitude more Au than intermediate solid solution ( ISS ) , the high - temperature precursors of bornite and chalcopyrite , respectively ( Simon et al . , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .
Peripheral veins cutting propylitic halos may also be Au rich , and at Mineral Park an outward zoning from Pb - Zn to Au - Ag is evident ( Eidel et al . , 1968 ; Lang and Eastoe , 1988 ; Fig . 9b ) .

The shallow - level , steam - heated and paleowater - table zones are typically devoid of precious and base metals and As and Sb , unless telescoped onto the underlying mineralization as a result of water - table descent , but commonly have elevated Hg contents ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ; Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) .

Magma and fluid production
Porphyry Cu systems typically span the upper 4 km or so of the crust ( Singer et al . , 2008 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) , with their centrally located stocks being connected downward to parental magma chambers at depths of perhaps 5 to 15 km ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ; Fig . 4 ) .
The parental chambers , tending to be localized at sites of neutral buoyancy ( Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) , are the sources of both magmas and hightemperature , high - pressure metalliferous fluids throughout system development .
The metal - charged aqueous phase is released from the cooling and fractionating parental chambers during open - system magma convection as well as later stagnant magma crystallization ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) .
Convection provides an efficient mechanism for delivery of copious amounts of the aqueous phase , in the form of bubble - rich magma , from throughout the parental chambers to the basal parts of porphyry stocks or dike swarms ( Candela , 1991 ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The shallow - level porphyry stocks do not themselves generate the bulk of the magmatic fluid volume , but simply act as " exhaust valves , " conduits for its upward transmission from the parental chambers , perhaps via cupolas on their roofs ( Fig . 4 ) .
Porphyry Cu mineralization in the deeply formed ( up to 9 km ) potassic alteration zones at Butte and elsewhere took place directly from a single - phase , relatively low salinity ( 2−10 wt % NaCl equiv ) , aqueous liquid ( Rusk et al . , 2004 ( Rusk et al . , , 2008a ; such a phase may contain several thousand ppm to several percent of base metals and several ppm Au , based on thermodynamic ( Heinrich , 2005 ) and analytical ( Audétat et al . , 2008 ) observations .
Fluid inclusion microanalysis and experimental studies reveal that , during phase separation , specific element suites selectively fractionate between the vapor and hypersaline liquid .
Transport of Cu and probably also Au was for decades tacitly assumed to be in the form of chloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( e . g . , Holland , 1972 ; Burnham , 1967Burnham , , 1997Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , but recent experimental work and fluid inclusion S analysis show that volatile S ligands ( H 2 S ± SO 2 ) in the vapor phase can also act as major Cu - and Au - transporting agents ( Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Seo et al . , 2009 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Potassic alteration and associated metal deposition are initiated under near - lithostatic conditions and involve extensive hydraulic fracturing of the ductile rock at high strain rates ( Fournier , 1999 ) to generate the pervasive stockwork veining ( Burnham , 1979 ) : a process that may give rise to large increases in rock volume ( Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The single - phase liquid , the mineralizer in deeply formed porphyry Cu deposits , may generate the relatively uncommon EDM halo veinlets ( Rusk et al . , 2008a ; Proffett , 2009 ) , whereas the two - phase fluid produces the more common A - and B - type quartz veinlets ( e . g . , Roedder , 1984 , and references therein ) .
The stockwork veinlets control and focus continued fluid ascent , with partial dissolution of quartz during cooling through its retrograde solubility field ( < ~ 550 - 400 °C at pressures < ~ 900 b ; Fournier , 1999 ) enhancing the permeability of the A - type quartz veinlets during at least some of the Cu - Fe sulfide precipitation ( Rusk and Reed , 2002 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) ; synmineral faulting and fracturing may play a similar role .
The quartz - veined cores of potassic zones remain barren where temperatures are too high to permit appreciable Cu - Fe sulfide and associated Au deposition , potentially giving rise to the bell - and cap - shaped ore zones described above ( e . g . , Bingham , Resolution , and Batu Hijau ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ; Setyandhaka et al . , 2008 ) .

Fluid pressures may fluctuate from lithostatic to hydrostatic during porphyry Cu formation ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , as a result of both repetitive fracture propagation and sealing and reductions in confining pressure consequent upon surface degradation ( see below ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal brecciation may be triggered by sudden release of fluid overpressures caused by roof failure above large , expanding vapor bubbles ( Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; Burnham , 1985 ) , particularly near the ductile - brittle transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
Convective circulation of the external water takes place where rock permeabilities are adequate ( Fig . 14 ) : a process that acts as a potent cooling mechanism for porphyry Cu systems ( Cathles , 1977 ) , particularly after parental intrusions have crystallized and no longer exsolve magmatic fluid .

Admixture of magmatic and meteoric fluids , with the latter dominant , was long considered necessary to produce sericitic alteration and the attendant low - to moderate - salinity liquid , i . e . , 5 to 10× dilution of the hypersaline liquid ( e . g . , Sheppard et al . , 1971 ; Taylor , 1974 ) , but recent interpretations of stable O and H isotope data reveal that an exclusively magmatic fluid is quite capable of producing the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Kusakabe et al . , 1990 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Harris and Golding , 2002 ; Skewes et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2004 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 ) .

High Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn contents are recorded in hypersaline liquid inclusions from quartz veinlets formed during potassic alteration ( Bodnar , 1995 ; Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ) , but these chloridecomplexed metals ( see above ) remain in solution because they are not appreciably concentrated in the sulfides present in the main porphyry Cu orebodies .

The Cordilleran massive sulfide lodes are localized where the liquid follows pronounced structural permeability spanning the sericitic to advanced argillic transition ( Figs . 6 , 10 ) or , less commonly , encounters reactive carbonate rocks ( e . g . , Baumgartner et al . , 2008 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

At paleowater tables , near the tops of the lithocaps and nearby areas , the liquid portion of the boiling high - and intermediate - sulfidation fluids follows hydrologic gradients , whereas the H 2 S - bearing vapor ( with H 2 S contributed by the magma as well as SO 2 disproportionation ) continues its ascent into the overlying vadose zones .
Diatreme breccias are preferentially emplaced at this time because external water access to late - mineral magma bodies , a requirement for phreatomagmatic activity , is facilitated .
Contractional settings are also likely in belts or districts where porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms are overprinted on precursor plutons or , in island - arc settings , where marine sedimentary rocks only slightly older than the porphyry Cu systems have been uplifted to ~ 1 km or more above sea level ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) .

Large , high - grade porphyry Cu deposits seem to be favored by the " pressure - cooker effect " provided by impermeable wall rocks , including massive , thickly bedded carbonate sequences ( e . g . , Grasberg ) , a situation that can also lead to the formation of blind high - grade deposits overlain by largely unaltered rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett , Ridgeway , Pueblo Viejo ) .

Highly permeable , noncarbonate host rocks may promote lateral fluid channeling , which may lead to generation of distal ore types other than structurally controlled veins ( e . g . , Andacollo ) .

Porous and permeable volcaniclastic and epiclastic sequences also favor large - tonnage orebody development in the lithocap environment , especially where they happen to be shallowly located with respect to paleosurfaces .

Lithocaps dominated by quartz - alunite or quartz - pyrophyllite alteration but without appreciable development of vuggy , residual quartz and associated silicification , perhaps because fluid pH was too high or exposure level is too deep , are much less likely to contain major high - sulfidation Au deposits , although Pueblo Viejo provides a salutary exception ( Kesler et al . , 1981 ; .
Thermal regimes that permit vertically extensive ore zone development in potassic zones commonly have greater size potential than those that were excessively hot internally , thereby inhibiting sulfide precipitation and giving rise to large , lowgrade or barren cores ; the exception is where the resultant shell - like orebodies are areally extensive and thick ( e . g . , Bingham and Resolution ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .

porphyry Cu deposits provide the justification for deeper drill testing of both bornite - bearing and bornite - free potassic alteration zones that are judged to have been only relatively shallowly explored ( e . g . , Esperanza ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

Structural permeability linking porphyry stocks to the fringes of carbonate rock - dominated districts seems to be a requirement for formation of substantial sediment - hosted Au deposits ( e . g . , Bingham district ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ) .
Porphyry Cu deposits are arguably the most studied and potentially best known and understood ore deposit type ( e . g . , Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , and their relationships with the skarn environment have been appreciated for many years ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A positive topographic expression results only where barren , late - to postmineral porphyry plugs intrude the diatreme breccias ( e . g . , Dizon and Guinaoang , Philippines and Batu Hijau ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Fig . 6 ) .
A quartz - pyrite assemblage replaces any carbonate rocks incorporated in advanced argillic lithocaps ( e . g . , Bisbee , Arizona ; Einaudi , 1982 ) .
A magmatic source would certainly be favored where sodic - calcic zones are metal bearing ( see above ) .
The distinctive aplitic groundmass texture is ascribed to pressure quenching during rapid ascent and consequent volatile loss ( Burnham , 1967 ) .
The pebble dikes and related breccias are chiefly restricted to porphyry Cu deposits , including their marginal parts , whereas brecciation induced by the fluid confinement typifies the overlying highsulfidation epithermal environment ( Fig . 6 ) .
The late , white sericitic alteration has varied distribution patterns in porphyry Cu deposits .

In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts of porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
In highly telescoped systems , the advanced argillic lithocaps impinge on the upper parts porphyry stocks ( Fig . 10 ) and their roots may penetrate downward for > 1 km .
The upper parts of porphyry Cu systems , mainly at shallower levels than their porphyry intrusions , are characterized by lithocaps : lithologically controlled zones of pervasive advanced argillic alteration with structurally controlled components , including their subvertical root zones ( Figs . 4 , 6 , 10 ; Table 2 ; Sillitoe , 1995a ) .

The parental magmas need to be water rich ( > ~ 4 wt % ) and oxidized in order to maximize the metal contents of the resultant aqueous phase ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Candela , 1992 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 2005 ) .
The magmas are also exceptionally S rich , as emphasized by recognition of anhydrite as a magmatic mineral in some porphyry stocks ( Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2004 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Chambefort et al . , 2008 ) .
As porphyry Cu systems cool through the 700° to 550 °C temperature range , the single - phase liquid or , more commonly , coexisting hypersaline liquid and vapor initiate potassic alteration and perhaps the first metal precipitation in and around the early porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Frei , 1995 ; Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) .

As magma solidification advances downward ( middle ) , the entire system progressively cools , and the rock can fracture in a brittle fashion on cooling below ~ 400ºC ( Fournier , 1999 ) ; at this stage , lithostatic gives way to hydrostatic pressure , and erosion ( or some other mechanism ) progressively degrades the paleosurface .

The low - salinity liquid , whose ascent is controlled by the preexisting quartz veinlet stockworks , synmineral faults , and permeability contrasts provided by steep intrusive contacts , appears to be responsible for the progressive formation of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic alteration , as well as continued advanced argillic alteration and the principal Cu and Au mineralization in the overlying lithocaps Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Rusk et al . , 2008b ) .
The low - to moderate - salinity liquids responsible for highsulfidation deposits in lithocaps may , under appropriate structural and hydrologic conditions , pass into adjoining , lessaltered rocks and undergo sufficient neutralization and reduction during outward flow and wall - rock reaction to produce liquids appropriate for formation of intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits ( Sillitoe , 1999b ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ; Fig . 14 ) .

If porphyry Cu deposits concealed beneath advanced argillic alteration are the principal target , then deeply eroded lithocaps in which quartz - pyrophyllite ± muscovite ± andalusite alteration is prominent are best selected ( e . g . , El Salvador ) .

The plutons may erupt volcanic rocks , but generally prior to initiation of the systems .
The alteration and mineralization in porphyry Cu systems , occupying many cubic kilometers of rock , are zoned outward from the stocks or dike swarms , which typically comprise several generations of intermediate to felsic porphyry intrusions .

The porphyry Cu mineralization occurs in a distinctive sequence of quartz - bearing veinlets as well as in disseminated form in the altered rock between them .
The most distal deposit types at all levels of the systems tend to be visually the most subtle , which may result in their being missed due to overshadowing by more promi - nent alteration - mineralization .

The Cu and , in places , Au contents of skarns are typically higher still .
Each belt corresponds to a magmatic arc of broadly similar overall dimensions .
The stress regime depends , among other factors , on whether there is trench advance or rollback and the degree of obliquity of the plate convergence vector ( Dewey , 1980 ) .
The precursor plutons may act as hosts to a single deposit , as at Mount Polley , British Columbia ( Fraser et al . , 1995 ) ; an alignment of coalesced deposits , as in the Los Bronces - Río Blanco district ( Fig . 5a ) ; or clusters of two or more discrete deposits , as in the El Abra intrusive complex , northern Chile ( Fig . 5b ) and Guichon Creek batholith , Highland Valley district , British Columbia ( Fig . 5c ) .
The precursor plutons and porphyry Cu stocks are typically separated by time gaps of 1 to 2 m . y .
The precursor pluton is multiphase , whereas the parental pluton is shown as a single body in which the concentric dotted lines mark its progressive inward consolidation .
The volcanic sequence is a stratovolcano ( but could just as readily be a dome complex ; Fig . 6 ) and has been partly eroded prior to porphyry Cu formation .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts of the underlying rocks .
The lithocap affects the volcanic pile as well as uppermost parts underlying rocks .
The distal parts of porphyry Cu systems , beyond the porphyry Cu deposits , either lack porphyry intrusions or contain only relatively minor dikes ( e . g . , Virgin dike in the skarn - dominated Copper Canyon district , Nevada , and Yerington district skarn Cu occurrences ; Wotruba et al . , 1988 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) .
The porphyry Cu - related intrusions comprise multiple phases ( Kirkham , 1971 ; Gustafson , 1978 ) , which were emplaced immediately before ( early porphyries ) , during ( intermineral porphyries ) , near the end of ( late mineral porphyries ) , and after ( postmineral porphyries ) the alteration and mineralization events ( Fig . 6 ) .
The earlier porphyry bodies are not destroyed when intruded by later phases but merely split apart , causing overall inflation of the rock package as would occur during ordinary dike emplacement .
The upper contacts of a few porphyry Cu intrusions are characterized by unidirectional solidification textures ( USTs ) : alternating , crenulate layers of quartz and aplite and / or aplite porphyry produced as a result of pressure fluctuations at the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions ( e . g . , Kirkham and Sinclair , 1988 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Cannell et al . , 2005 ; .

The porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu deposits are exclusively of I - type and magnetite - series affiliation ( Ishihara , 1981 ) , and typically metaluminous and medium K calc - alkaline , but may also fall into the high K calc - alkaline ( shoshonitic ) or alkaline fields ( see Seedorff et al . , 2005 , for further details ) .
The porphyry intrusions contain variable amounts of phenocrysts , typically including hornblende and / or biotite , and fine - grained , commonly aplitic groundmass , resulting in open to crowded textures .
The porphyry phases in some individual deposits may have clear compositional differences ( e . g . , Bajo de la Alumbrera ; Proffett , 2003 ) and / or characteristic igneous textures ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) ; however , particularly in many porphyry Au and Cu - Au deposits , the different phases are commonly only subtly different or nearly identical .
The poorly lithified , friable nature and clay - rich matrix of many diatreme breccias give rise to recessive topography and little , if any , surface exposure .

Many diatremes are late - stage additions to porphyry Cu systems , in which they commonly postdate and either cut or occur alongside porphyry Cu mineralization at depth ( Howell and Molloy , 1960 ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Garwin , 2002 ) but overlap with high - sulfidation events at shallower epithermal levels ( e . g . , Dizon ; Fig . 6 ) .
The diatremes , particularly their contact zones , may localize part of the high - sulfidation Au mineralization ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu , Papua New Guinea ; Fig . 6 ) .
The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .

The metal contents of some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias may be higher than those of surrounding porphyry Cu stockwork mineralization , reflecting their high intrinsic permeability .
The breccias are typically late - stage features and , hence , unaltered and barren .
the magmatic - hydrothermal breccias and pebble dikes at the porphyry Cu level , these phreatic breccias in the high - sulfidation environment may attain the paleosurface , where hydrothermal eruptions result in subaerial breccia accumulation as aprons around the eruptive vents ( e . g . , Hedenquist and Henley , 1985 ; Fig . 6 ) .
The massive , high - sulfidation pyrite - enargite replacements in carbonate rocks are also locally transitional outward through high - to intermediate - sulfidation Zn - Pb - Ag ore , a continuum observed in the Tintic and Colquijirca districts ( Lindgren and Loughlin , 1919 ; Bendezú et al . , 2003 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .
The alteration - mineralization zoning sequence typically affects several cubic kilometers of rock ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Beane and Titley , 1981 ) , although sericitic and , 10 .

The potassic alteration generally becomes less intense from the older to younger porphyry phases , although the late - mineral intrusions postdate it and display a propylitic assemblage ( Fig . 7 ) , albeit of later timing than the propylitic halos developed peripheral to potassic zones .

The alteration is typified by partial to complete transformation of mafic minerals to chlorite , plagioclase to sericite ( fine - grained muscovite ) and / or illite , and magmatic and any hydrothermal magnetite to hematite ( martite and / or specularite ) , along with deposition of pyrite and chalcopyrite .

The Cu - bearing sulfides typically occur as fine - grained coatings on disseminated pyrite grains , which leads to recognition difficulties in deposits that also underwent supergene Cu sulfide enrichment ( e . g . , Chuquicamata , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) ; indeed , the hypogene contribution is commonly not distinguished from the supergene enrichment products ( e . g . , Taca Taca Bajo , Argentina ; Rojas et al . , 1999 ) .

Any sediment - hosted Au mineralization on the fringes of carbonate rock - hosted porphyry Cu systems forms where rock permeability is enhanced by decalcification ( Fig . 10 ) , including sanding of dolomite , but also locally occluded by Au - related jasperoid formation ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , d ) .

The quartz veinlet stockworks are most intense in and around the early porphyry intrusions , where they may constitute as much as 90 to 100 percent of the rock ( e . g . , Ok Tedi and Hugo Dummett ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) , and die out gradually both laterally into the wall rocks ( e . g . , Sierrita - Esperanza , Arizona ; Titley et al . , 1986 ) and downward ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) ; however , they tend to have more clearcut upper limits , just a few tens of meters above the apices of the porphyry intrusions , in the few deposits where relevant data are available ( e . g . , Guinaoang , Wafi - Golpu , and Hugo Dummett ; Sillitoe and Angeles , 1985 ; Sillitoe , 1999b ; Khashgeral et al . , 2006 ) .

The quartz veinlets commonly cut proximal prograde exoskarn ( Einaudi , 1982 ) but do not extend into the more distal carbonate rock - hosted ore types .
The dominant veinlets in most Au - only porphyry deposits , as documented in the Maricunga belt , are distinctly banded and comprise layers of both translucent and dark - gray quartz , the color of the latter commonly caused by abundant vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .

The roots of lithocaps may also contain the relatively high temperature species , andalusite and corundum ( > ~ 370ºC ; Hemley et al . , 1980 ) , as accompaniments to pyrophyllite and / or muscovite ( e . g . , Cabang Kiri , Indonesia , El Salvador , and Cerro Colorado ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .
The principal borosilicate mineral in lithocaps is dumortierite rather than tourmaline .

Any intermediate - sulfidation precious metal mineralization developed alongside the lithocaps contains much higher contents of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn than the high - sulfidation orebodies , in keeping with the situation described above from the porphyry Cu level .
The base and precious metal deposit types in both carbonate and noncarbonate wall - rock lithologic units likely form from the same aqueous magmatic fluids that are involved in porphyry Cu alteration and mineralization , wherever there is provision of lateral fluid access from the porphyry stock or dikes via lithologic , structural , and / or hydrothermally induced permeability ( Fig . 14 ) .

Many porphyry Cu systems , particularly those that are only shallowly exposed , lack known precursor plutons , probably because they lie at inaccessible depths ( Fig . 4 ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain minor volumes ( 5−10 % ) of magmatic - hydrothermal breccia ( Fig . 6 ) ; however , even major deposits can be either breccia free , as at Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , or breccia dominated , as exemplified by > 5 Gt of ore - grade breccia at Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Warnaars et al . , 1985 ; Serrano et al . , 1996 ; Fig . 5a ) .
Many porphyry Cu deposits are formed as vertically extensive bodies , which become progressively lower grade both outward and downward , whereas others have a bell - or cap - like form because little Cu was precipitated internally at depth ( e . g . , Resolution ; Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) .
Many lithocaps are vertically zoned , from the previously described quartz - pyrophyllite at depth to predominant quartz - alunite and residual quartz - the residue of extreme base leaching ( Stoffregen , 1987 ) with a vuggy appearance that reflects the original rock texture - at shallower levels where the causative fluid was cooler and , hence , more acidic ( Giggenbach , 1997 ; Fig . 10 ) .
Late porphyry Cu system evolution
These parental magma chambers , also represented by similar equigranular to weakly porphyritic plutons , are not exposed in porphyry Cu systems unless postmineralization extensional tectonism caused profound tilting and dismemberment of the systems , as reconstructed in the Yerington district , Nevada ( Dilles , 1987 ; Dilles and Proffett , 1995 ) and elsewhere ( Seedorff et al . , 2008 ) .

These phreatic breccias host ore in many high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu deposits ( e . g . , Choquelimpie , northern Chile ; Gröpper et al . , 1991 ) .
A few deposits , instead of dying out either gradually ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Quiroga , 1995 ) or fairly abruptly ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq , Pakistan ) at depth , have knife - sharp bases as a result of truncation by latemineral intrusions ( e . g . , Santo Tomas II ; Sillitoe and Gappe , 1984 ) .
These high - sulfidation assemblages commonly have higher Cu contents than the former potassic alteration , resulting in hypogene enrichment ( Brimhall , 1979 ) , although any Au may be depleted ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ; Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Where carbonate ( limestone and dolomite ) instead of igneous or siliciclastic rocks host porphyry Cu deposits , calcic or magnesian exoskarn is generated in proximity to the porphyry intrusions , whereas marble is produced beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 10 ) .

These banded veinlets are ascribed to the shallowness of porphyry Au formation ( < 1 km ; Muntean and Einaudi , 2000 ) .
These advanced argillic alteration zones extend upward to the sites of paleowater tables , which may be defined , if suitable aquifers ( e . g . , fragmental volcanic rocks ) were present , by subhorizontal , tabular bodies of massive opaline or chalcedonic silicification , up to 10 m or so thick ; the low crystallinity is caused by the low temperature ( ~ 100ºC ) of silica deposition .

These Zn - Pb - Ag ± Mn halos commonly coincide spatially with propylitic alteration zones but are invariably best defined in the distal skarn environment ( e . g . , Meinert , 1987 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) , beyond which even more distal Au - As ± Sb zones may be developed ( e . g . , Bingham and Sepon districts ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 9a , c ) .
Early porphyry Cu system evolution
These pressure variations may induce changes in the fluid phases present and consequent remobilization as well as precipitation of metals ( e . g . , Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
Since chlorite - sericite alteration partially or totally reconstitutes potassic assemblages , and sericitic alteration does the same to potassic and / or chloritesericite assemblages , it is generally impossible to determine if the contained metals are inherited from the former sulfide assemblage ( s ) ( e . g . , Brimhall , 1979 ) or newly introduced in the ascendant , still magmatic - sourced aqueous liquid .

In the skarn environment , the early two - phase hypersaline liquid plus vapor is likely to be followed under declining temperature conditions by the singlephase liquid ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Fig . 14 ) , from which the retrograde skarn Cu ± Au ± Zn , carbonate - replacement Cu or Zn - Pb - Ag - ( Au ) , and sediment - hosted Au - ( As - Sb ) deposits are formed ( e . g . , Meinert et al . , 1997Meinert et al . , , 2003Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Where lower grade intermineral intrusions and barren lateand postmineral intrusions or diatremes are volumetrically important , the original mineralized rock volumes may be physically disrupted and ore - zone geometries radically changed and generally rendered less continuous .
Hence , pebble dikes display downward transitions to porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Tintic , Utah and Toquepala , southern Peru ; Farmin , 1934 ; Zweng and Clark , 1995 ) , whereas the breccias triggered by fluid confinement do not normally form in close proximity to intrusive bodies .
In the lithocap environment - typically located above , areally more extensive than , and commonly overprinting porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 6 ; see below ) - high - sulfidation epithermal Au , Ag , and / or Cu deposits are characteristic ; nevertheless , the preserved parts of many lithocaps are essentially barren .
In the few deposits where it is recognized , the early , greenish sericitic alteration is centrally located and hosts a low sulfidation - state chalcopyrite - bornite assemblage , which is commonly ore grade ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

Such a decrease in solubility leads to wholesale precipitation of the Cu - Fe sulfides together with Au , thereby potentially accounting for the typically shallow formation ( Cox and Singer , 1992 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) of Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

As the thermal regimes of porphyry Cu systems decay , shallowly generated alteration - mineralization types become telescoped over more deeply formed ones ( e . g . , Gustafson , 1978 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) , thereby causing the sequence of metal remobilization and reprecipitation events emphasized above .

In any deposit cluster or alignment , the best deposit may be found first or only after several lesser discoveries have already been made ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Kirwin et al . , 2003 ) .
are the shallow - level ( < 1 km paleodepth ) counterparts of the Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins located alongside porphyry Cu deposits , but no direct connection between the two types is evident ( Fig . 6 ) .
In some bornite - rich centers , the sulfidation state is low enough to stabilize digenite ± chalcocite ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Table 2 ) .

There , Cu ± Mo ± Au characterize the potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic cores of systems .
In many Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , Mo tends to be concentrated as external annuli partly overlapping the Cu - Au cores ( e . g . , Saindak , Pakistan , Cabang Kiri , Batu Hijau , Bajo de la Alumbrera , and Esperanza ; Sillitoe and Khan , 1977 ; Lowder and Dow , 1978 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Garwin , 2002 ; Proffett , 2003 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

The only fluid present is of external origin and produces propylitic alteration similar to that in the earlier formed propylitic halos .
In most magmatic arc terranes , it is roughly estimated that > 90 percent of explored porphyry systems lack Cu and Au concentrations with foreseeable potential , commonly because the ore - forming processes , from magma generation through to alteration and mineralization , were less than fully optimized ( e . g . , Richards , 2005 ) .

Vertical clast transport may be appreciable ( e . g . , > 1 km at Tintic ; Morris and Lovering , 1979 ) .
Although rock flour may occur between the clasts , quartz , chalcedony , alunite , barite , pyrite , and enargite are also widely observed as cementing minerals .
Equating chlorite - sericite alterationthe abbreviated name used by for the sericite - clay - chlorite ( SCC ) of Sillitoe and Gappe ( 1984 ) - with Meyer and Hemley ' s ( 1967 ) low - temperature intermediate argillic type ( e . g . , Sillitoe , 2000 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) causes confusion and should probably be discontinued .
Specific opaque mineral assemblages are intrinsic parts of each alteration type ( Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) because of the direct linkage between sulfidation state , the chief control on sulfide assemblages , and solution pH , a principal control of alteration type ( Barton and Skinner , 1967 ; Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ; Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Fig . 12 ) .
Although Cu and / or Au tenors of the former potassic zones may undergo depletion during the chlorite - sericite overprints ( e . g . , Esperanza , northern Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) , metal introduction is also widely recognized ( e . g . , Leach , 1999 ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ) and , at a few deposits , is considered to account for much of the contained Cu ( e . g . , Cerro Colorado , northern Chile ; Bouzari and Clark , 2006 ) .

The more structurally and lithologically confined components of lithocaps , termed ledges rather than veins because they are mainly the products of rock replacement rather than incremental open - space filling , display well - developed alteration zoning ( e . g . , Steven and Ratté , 1960 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , with cores of vuggy , residual quartz , and associated silicification rimmed outward ( and downward ) by consecutive bands of quartz - alunite , quartz - pyrophyllite / dickite / kaolinite ( pyrophyllite and dickite at hotter , deeper levels ) , and chlorite - illite / smectite .

The same liquid continues upward into the lithocap where , upon cooling in an unbuffered environment , it evolves into a high sulfidation - state liquid ; if properly focused , it may generate high - sulfidation ( HS ) epithermal deposits .
Abundant hydrothermal magnetite is a good indicator of potentially Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Sillitoe , 1979 ) , and the presence of banded quartz veinlets may be used to identify most , but not all , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits .
( 7 ) if externally derived , nonmagmatic brine is responsible for at least some examples of sodic - calcic alteration , how does it access the cores of some porphyry Cu deposits between early porphyry emplacement and magmatic fluid ascent responsible for initiation of potassic alteration ( and locally sinuous Atype quartz veining ) ?

This same liquid also causes mineralization of the peripheral parts of systems , including the overlying lithocaps .
Note that subvolcanic basement rocks host much of the porphyry Cu deposit on the left , whereas that on the right is mainly enclosed by two phases of the precursor pluton .

However , Cu - poor porphyry Au deposits appear to occur exclusively in association with calcalkaline diorite and quartz diorite porphyries ( e . g . , .
All these carbonate rock - hosted ore types are replacements of receptive beds , commonly beneath relatively impermeable rock units ( e . g . , Titley , 1996 ) and , hence , tend to be strata bound , although high - and low - angle fault control is also widely emphasized ( e . g . , proximal skarns at Ok Tedi , Papua New Guinea , and Antamina , central Peru ; Rush and Seegers , 1990 ; Love et al . , 2004 ) .
Note that shallow alteration - mineralization types consistently overprint deeper ones .
Locally , texture - destructive quartz - K ± Na - feldspar flooding overprints and destroys the more typical potassic assemblages ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .

However , sericitic alteration may also constitute ore where appreciable Cu remains with the pyrite , either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( typically , pyrite - bornite , pyrite - chalcocite , pyrite - covellite , pyritetennantite , and pyrite - enargite ; Table 2 ; cf .
Where the fluids that cause advanced argillic alteration are F rich , topaz , zunyite , and fluorite are lithocap minerals ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Perelló et al . , 2001 ; Khashgerel et al . , 2006 , 2008 , andResolution ) .

overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Dilles , 1987 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , effects that are accompanied by downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition ( Fournier , 1999 ) .
However , meteoric water involvement in late sericitic alteration is by no means precluded ( e . g . , Harris et al . , 2005 ) , particularly on the margins of systems where the advecting magmatic liquid may entrain convecting meteoric water , although its formerly preeminent role in the porphyry Cu genetic model ( e . g . , Beane and Titley , 1981 ; Hunt , 1991 ) is now greatly diminished .
However , local structural observations , perhaps interpreted from geophysical responses , may assist in this regard , although this approach played no part in the recent discoveries noted above in the Chilean porphyry Cu districts .
Where the sericitic alteration is superimposed on quartz veinlet stockworks , Cu contents in the form of the high sulfidationstate Cu sulfides may be increased by hypogene enrichment ( e . g . , Wafi - Golpu ) .

Unusually large , laterally extensive proximal skarn bodies may form preferentially where suitable carbonate host rocks abut the tops of porphyry stocks ( e . g . , Antamina ; Redwood , 2004 ) .

However , through - going structural ( fault and fracture network ) and hydrothermal ( phreatic breccia and vuggy , residual quartz ) permeability is probably the most critical requirement for the development of important high - sulfidation deposits ; otherwise , inadequate latestage aqueous liquids from the cooling parental magma chambers gain access to the lithocaps .
Commonly , several discrete stocks are emplaced in and above the pluton roof zones , resulting in either clusters or structurally controlled alignments of porphyry Cu systems .
Peripheral mineralization is less conspicuous in noncarbonate wall rocks but may include base metal - or Au - bearing veins and mantos .
Along with calc - alkaline batholiths and volcanic chains , they are the hallmarks of magmatic arcs constructed above active subduction zones at convergent plate margins ( Sillitoe , 1972 ; Richards , 2003 ) , although a minority of such systems occupies postcollisional and other tectonic settings that develop after subduction ceases ( e . g . , Richards , 2009 ) .

Again , the Andes ( Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) , southwestern North America ( Titley , 1993 ; Barra et al . , 2005 ) , and Apuseni - Banat - Timok - Srednogorie belt ( Zimmerman et al . , 2008 ) provide prime examples .

Changes in crustal stress regime are considered by some as especially favorable times for porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposit generation ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) , with Bingham and Bajo de la Alumbrera , Argentina , for example , both apparently occupying such a tectonic niche ( Presnell , 1997 ; Sasso and Clark , 1998 ; Halter et al . , 2004 ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .
The entire breccia body originally underwent potassic alteration prior to partial overprinting by sericitic and , subsequently , advanced argillic assemblages , as documented by localized occurrence of remanent magnetite and muscovite after coarse - grained biotite in the cement to the sericitized breccia .

Under these lower temperature conditions , the aqueous liquid phase exsolves more slowly from the still crystallizing magma and , in turn , advects more slowly and cools , such that it may not intersect its solvus .

There , it condenses into ground water to oxidize and produce the low - temperature , acidic fluid responsible for the blanketlike , advanced argillic alteration zones characteristic of the steam - heated environment ( Sillitoe , 1993 ( Sillitoe , , 1999bFig . 10 ) .

Commonly , the highest grade and most coherent porphyry Cu deposits are those that retain their early porphyry phases and potassic alteration assemblages - with which much of the metal content is initially introduced - in essentially unmodified form .

Elsewhere , small - volume porphyry intrusions and the associated magmatic fluids fail to effectively penetrate low - permeability rock packages , leading to the apparently uncommon development of blind , high - grade deposits , as at Hugo Dummett in the Oyu Tolgoi district ( Kirwin et al . , 2003 and Ridgeway in the Cadia district ( Wilson et al . , 2003 ) .
Diatremes , upward - flared volcanic vents generated mainly by phreatomagmatic eruptive activity , are widespread in porphyry Cu systems ( Sillitoe , 1985 ) , including their shallow , epithermal parts ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Turner , 1999 ; Fig . 6 ) .

Much of the Mo in many porphyry Cu - Mo deposits occurs in the B - type veinlets , in marked contrast to the Cu dominance of the A - type generations , but D - type veinlets may also contain appreciable amounts of molybdenite in some deposits .
Addition of mafic melt to the parental chambers could be an effective means of augmenting S and metal budgets Hattori and Keith , 2001 ; Maughan et al . , 2002 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ) .
Progressive disproportionation of the contained SO 2 ( to H 2 SO 4 and H 2 S ) once it and HCl ( plus any HF ) condense into ground water ( Giggenbach , 1992 ; Rye , 1993 ) generates the extremely low pH fluid responsible for the high degrees of base leaching involved in advanced argillic lithocap formation ( e . g . , Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Clusters are broadly equidimensional groupings of deposits ( e . g . , Globe - Miami district , Arizona ; Fig . 3a ) , whereas alignments are linear deposit arrays oriented either parallel or transverse to the magmatic arcs and their coincident porphyry Cu belts .

However , in Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits , the Au , as small ( < 20 µm ) grains of high ( > 900 ) fineness native metal and in solid solution in bornite and , to a lesser degree , chalcopyrite ( e . g . , Arif and Baker , 2002 ) , and Cu are introduced together as components of centrally located potassic zones ; hence , the two metals normally correlate closely ( Sillitoe , 2000 ; Ulrich and Heinrich , 2001 ; Perelló et al . , 2004b ) .

End - stage , groundwater incursion into the hot porphyry Cu deposits leads to anhydrite veinlet formation , in conformity with the mineral ' s retrograde solubility ( e . g . , Rimstidt , 1997 ) .
In arcs where volcanic rocks are abundant , large - volume ignimbrites , indicative of caldera formation , are taken to seriously downgrade porphyry Cu and related epithermal Au potential for the reason given above .
In contrast , D - type veinlets may be up to 1 km laterally away from the target .

Where intense chlorite - sericite or sericitic alteration overprints are developed , the reconstitution of potassic alteration may result in either reduction or complete stripping of original metal contents .

However , the erosion involved in the unroofing of porphyry Cu deposits also severely degrades volcanic landforms ( e . g . , Farallón Negro district ) and , commonly , entirely removes the eruptive products , at least in the general vicinities of the deposits themselves .

In contrast , clast transport in the phreatic breccias produced by fluid confinement in the high - sulfidation environment is more restricted , with many of the clasts being locally derived from the seals themselves and , hence , commonly composed of silicified rock ( Table 1 ) .

However , the patches may also comprise alunite or kaolinite , suggesting that the texture may result by either preferential nucleation of any common advanced argillic mineral or even advanced argillic overprinting of a nucleation texture developed during earlier potassic or chlorite - sericite alteration of fragmental rocks ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 , and Caspiche ) .

However , the porphyry Cu - Au deposits associated with alkaline rocks , particularly those in British Columbia , are largely devoid of veinlets ( Barr et al . , 1976 ) .
In contrast , Cu and Mo correlate less well , with spatial separation of the two metals commonly resulting from the different timing of their introduction ( e . g . , Los Pelambres ; Atkinson et al . , 1996 ) .
In contrast , Mo may be transported as different , possibly oxochloride complexes in the hypersaline liquid phase ( Ulrich and Mavrogenes , 2008 ) .
The different Mo complexing ( see above ) , probably assisted by progressive increase of the Mo / Cu ratio in the residual parental melt as crystallization proceeds ( Candela and Holland , 1986 ) , results in much of the molybdenite being precipitated not only later than but also spatially separate from the bulk of the Cu ± Au ( see above ) .

These shallow Au precipitation processes may be particularly effective in permeable phreatic breccias created by boiling of the ascendant liquid , vapor buildup beneath silicified seals , and eventual catastrophic release , perhaps assisted by external triggers ( faulting , seismic shaking , and / or deep intrusion contributing gases ; e . g . , Nairn et al . , 2005 ) .

The resultant telescoping is potentially more extreme , giving rise to deep penetration of advanced argillic alteration into porphyry stocks , where porphyry Cu systems undergo either rapid , synhydrothermal erosion under high uplift , pluvial or glacial conditions ( Fig . 14 ) or , perhaps less commonly , gravity - induced sector collapse of any overlying volcanic edifices ( Sillitoe , 1994 ; Perelló et al . , 1998 ; Landtwing et al . , 2002 ; Carman , 2003 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ) .

Furthermore , Mo - as well as Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits may be associated with Au - endowed lithocaps ( e . g . , Nevados del Famatina district ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) , although lithocaps above any porphyry Cu deposit may lack appreciable high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Red Mountain ; Corn , 1975 ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , at least in their preserved parts .

For example , porphyry Cu prospects containing only weakly developed potassic alteration and A - type quartz veinlets in their central parts , indicating a deficiency of early - stage magmatic fluids , are typically subore grade .
Although many hydrothermal breccias , like the late diatremes mentioned above , are commonly diluents to ore , some magmatic - hydrothermal breccias give rise to anomalously highgrade rock volumes despite their intermineral timing .
Furthermore , magmatic - hydrothermal breccia cemented mainly by quartz , tourmaline , and pyrite may be zoned downward over hundreds of meters to chalcopyrite - rich material , which is likely to persist into any underlying biotite - cemented breccia ( e . g . , Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Vargas et al . , 1999 ; Fig . 8 ) .
( 10 ) why is Au transported to the distal limits of only a few porphyry Cu systems for concentration in sediment - hosted deposits , and why are most of these apparently small compared to virtually identical Carlin - type deposits ( Cline et al . , 2005 ) ?
Nevertheless , calderas may influence the localization of later , genetically unrelated porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , El Salvador , northern Chile ; Cornejo et al . , 1997 ) .
However , much larger porphyry intrusions act as hosts in places , such as the elongate , 14 - km - long stock at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic ( e . g . , Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 3b ) and the 4 - km - long , < 50 - mwide dike at Hugo Dummett ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 3d ) .

Commonly , the xenoliths are largely assimilated by the younger phases , leaving only the contained quartz veinlets , chemically more refractory than the host porphyry , as " floating " pieces ( Fig . 7 ) .
In contrast to diatremes , magmatic - hydrothermal breccias are normally blind and do not penetrate the overlying epithermal environment , whereas downward they gradually fade away as a result of increased clast / matrix ± cement ratios , in places accompanied by pods of coarse - grained , pegmatoidal , potassic minerals representing former sites of vapor accumulation ( e . g . , Los Pelambres , central Chile ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ; Fig . 8 ; see below ) .

In contrast to The alteration - mineralization is zoned from advanced argillic ( with pyriteenargite ) at the top through sericitic ( with shallow pyrite and deep chalcopyrite ) to potassic ( with magnetite - chalcopyrite ± bornite ) at the bottom , where the breccia texture may be almost imperceptible and pegmatoidal pods are commonplace .
Nevertheless , larger tonnage orebodies may occur where permeable wall rocks exist , as exemplified by the stacked , Au - bearing mantos in amygdaloidal and brecciated andesitic flow tops at Andacollo , Chile ( Reyes , 1991 ) .

In the case of limestone protoliths , anhydrous , prograde andraditic garnet - diopsidic pyroxene skarn forms contemporaneously with the potassic alteration of noncarbonate lithologic units , whereas hydrous , retrograde skarn , commonly containing important amounts of magnetite , actinolite , epidote , chlorite , smectite , quartz , carbonate , and iron sulfides , is the equivalent of the chlorite - sericite and sericitic assemblages ( Einaudi et al . , 1981 ; Meinert et al . , 2003 ) .

Apart from the massive , commonly enargite - bearing sulfide veins and replacement bodies in the deeper parts of some lithocaps ( see above ) , veins and veinlets are generally only poorly developed , with much of the pyrite and any associated sulfides being in disseminated form .

Nevertheless , the lithocap mineralization also contains greater albeit trace amounts of Bi , W , Sn , and / or Te ( e . g . , Einaudi , 1982 ) as well as appreciable Mo .
Nevertheless , supergene leaching commonly masks the original Cu distribution pattern .
Nevertheless , resorption of any sulfide melt during ascent of oxidized magmatic fluids could make a major contribution to metal budgets ( Keith et al . , 1997 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ) .
Coexistence of immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor has been ubiquitously demonstrated in numerous fluid inclusion studies ( Roedder , 1984 ) , which also show that the liquid phase is enriched in Na , K , and Fe chlorides , giving rise to salinities of 35 to 70 wt percent NaCl equiv ( e . g . , Roedder , 1971 ; Nash , 1976 ; Eastoe , 1978 ; Bodnar , 1995 ) , whereas the vapor phase contains acidic volatile species , preeminently SO 2 , H 2 S , CO 2 , HCl , and any HF ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1992Giggenbach , , 1997 .

The voluminous vapor readily separates from the coexisting hypersaline liquid and , because of its lower density , ascends buoyantly into the 1 - to 2 - km - thick rock column above the porphyry intrusions ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Fig . 14 ) .
Cooling of the hypersaline liquid in contact with external wall rocks and dilution with meteoric water in the propylitic halos may be the main causes of Zn , Pb , Ag , and Mn precipitation ( Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ) , giving rise to the geochemical halos of these metals and , in some systems , localized vein concentrations ( Jerome , 1966 ; Figs . 6 , 10 ) .
( 2 ) what are cross - arc lineaments , and can they be demonstrated to play a truly influential role in the localization of porphyry Cu systems ?
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries of the lithocaps .
Less commonly , intermediate - sulfidation epithermal mineralization , chiefly veins , may develop on the peripheries lithocaps .
The sequence of alteration - mineralization events charted above is principally a consequence of progressive rock and fluid cooling , from > 700° to < 250 °C , caused by solidification of the underlying parental plutons and downward propagation of the lithostatic - hydrostatic transition .
The size of the stocks does not appear to bear any obvious relationship to the size of the associated porphyry Cu deposits and their Cu contents ( cf .
The most common hydrothermal breccias in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems are of magmatic - hydrothermal type , the products of release of overpressured magmatic FIG .
Hence , many of the breccias overprint preexisting alteration - mineralization patterns and veinlet types ( e . g . , Red Mountain , Arizona ; Quinlan , 1981 ) , which are incorporated as clasts .
In many cases , vapor can contain an appreciable amount of the Cu , Au , Ag , and S , plus much of the As , Sb , Te , and B , whereas Fe , Zn , Pb , Mn , and possibly Mo preferentially partition into the hypersaline liquid ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2007 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Wilkinson et al . , 2008 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ) .
On entering the lithocap environment , this intermediate sulfidation - state liquid ( forming chalcopyrite and tennantite at depth ) becomes unbuffered and easily evolves to a higher sulfidation state on cooling ( Einaudi et al . , 2003 ; Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 ) .
Each individual deposit or prospect must be carefully constructed using surface mapping and core logging , with particular attention paid to the temporal as well as spatial relationships of its constituent parts .

The processes of subduction erosion and terrane accretion at convergent margins may assist with land - or trenchward migration of the arcs and contained porphyry Cu belts ( e . g . , von Huene and Scholl , 1991 ; Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Several types of phreatic ( meteoric - hydrothermal ) breccia are widely observed in porphyry Cu systems ; they may be simply subdivided into pebble dikes and , uncommonly , larger bodies resulting from flashing of relatively cool ground water on approach to magma , typically late - mineral porphyry dikes ; and steep , tabular to irregular bodies triggered by vapor - pressure buildup beneath impermeable layers , commonly resulting from self sealing by silicification ( Sillitoe , 1985 ; Table 1 ) .

The deeper level high - sulfidation deposits , the Cordilleran base metal lodes of Einaudi ( 1982 ) , tend to be characterized by massive sulfides , commonly rich in the Cubearing sulfosalts ( enargite , luzonite , and / or famatinite ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization types become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 12 ) , with the result that the shallower alteration - mineralization zones invariably overprint and at least partly reconstitute deeper ones .
younger than the potassic zone that it overprints ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Padilla - Garza et al . , 2004 ) , reflecting the time needed for the telescoping to take place .
In some systems , Mn ( ± Ag ) is also markedly enriched in the outermost parts of the halos ( e . g . , Butte ; Meyer et al . , 1968 ) .
The recent major porphyry Cu - Mo ± Au discoveries in the productive Collahuasi ( Rosario Oeste ) , Chuquicamata ( Toki cluster ; Rivera and Pardo , 2004 ; Fig . 3b ) , Escondida ( Pampa Escondida ) , and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ( Los Sulfatos ; Fig . 5a ) districts of Chile are all within < 1 to 3 km of the previously known deposits , as are the several porphyry Cu - Au discoveries in the Cadia district ( Holliday et al . , 1999 ) and high - sulfidation Au discoveries in the Yanacocha district ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) that were made since mining commenced .
Obviously , major skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted Au deposits can only be expected where relatively thinly bedded , commonly silty carbonate rocks are present .

The forms of many porphyry Cu deposits mimic those of their host intrusions ; thus , cylindrical stocks typically host cylindrical orebodies ( Fig . 6 ) , whereas laterally extensive dikes give rise to orebodies with similar narrow , elongate shapes ( e . g . , Hugo Dummett ; Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
It may constitute annular zones separating the potassic cores from propylitic halos , as emphasized in early porphyry Cu models ( Jerome , 1966 ; Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Rose , 1970 ) , but is perhaps more common as structurally controlled or apparently irregular replacements within the upper parts of chlorite - sericite and / or potassic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The root zones of advanced argillic lithocaps , commonly at least partly structurally controlled , may overprint the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits , where the sericitic alteration is commonly transitional upward to quartz - pyrophyllite ( Fig . 10 ) , an assemblage widespread in the deep , higher temperature parts of many lithocaps ( e . g . , El Salvador ; Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Watanabe and Hedenquist , 2001 ) .

Once formed , the quartz - bearing veinlets are permanent features that are not erased during subsequent alteration overprinting , although their metal contents may be wholly or partially removed ( see above ) .

In contrast , most phreatomagmatic breccias , constituting maar - diatreme systems , are poorly mineralized at both the porphyry Cu and lithocap levels , mainly because many of them formed late in the evolution of systems .

Although all these alteration zones are pyritic , the Au - , Ag - , and Cu - bearing , high sulfidation - state assemblages ( commonly pyrite - enargite and pyrite - covellite ; Table 2 ; Fig . 12 ) tend to be confined to the vuggy , residual quartz and silicified rock , the latter normally better mineralized where phreatic breccias are present ( see above ) .

Alternatively , the deeply derived intermediate sulfidation - state liquids may bypass the lithocaps entirely and still produce intermediate - sulfidation mineralization at shallow epithermal levels ( Sillitoe and Hedenquist , 2003 , Fig . 14 ) .

Proximal and distal skarn , carbonate - replacement , and sediment - hosted mineralization types are obviously dependent on the presence of reactive carbonate rocks , particularly thinly bedded , silty units .
Large parts of many porphyry Cu deposits ( e . g . , Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Titley , 1982 ) , especially deeply formed ( e . g . , Butte ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008a or relatively deeply eroded examples like El Abra ( Ambrus , 1977 ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) and Gaby ( Gabriela Mistral ) , northern Chile ( Camus , 2001 ( Camus , , 2003 , are made up predominantly of potassic alteration , which grades marginally into generally weakly developed propylitic zones ( Fig . 10 ) .
The sequence , from potassic with peripheral propylitic ( prop ) through chlorite - sericite and sericitic to advanced argillic , is the result of increasing acidity consequent upon the declining temperature of the hydrothermal fluids .
Note the absence of Cu - bearing sulfides from the early , high - temperature advanced argillic zone .
The massive sulfide carbonate - replacement deposits are normally enveloped by marble .

Much of the metal in many porphyry Cu deposits is contained in the quartz - dominated , group 2 veinlets and as disseminated grains in the intervening potassic - altered rocks , although some of the late , group 3 quartz - sulfide veins and their wall rocks may also be important contributors .
Indeed , two or more porphyry Cu deposits may underlie some large , coalesced lithocaps ( Fig . 4 ) , which , as noted above , may have formed progressively over periods of up to several million years ( e . g . , Yanacocha ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .

In a general sense , the broad - scale zoning pattern developed in the deeper parts of porphyry Cu systems persists into the overlying lithocap environment where any Cu and Au ( ± Ag ) commonly occur approximately above the underlying porphyry Cu deposits , albeit commonly areally more extensively , particularly where structural control is prevalent .
In addition , upward decompression and expansion of the vapor phase causes rapidly decreasing solubility of the vapor - transported metals ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ) , as confirmed by their very low contents in high - temperature but atmospheric - pressure fumaroles ( Hedenquist , 1995 ) .
Indeed , the tops of porphyry intrusions may be subjected to at least four distinct alteration - mineralization events , commencing with potassic and ending with advanced argillic , as temperature fronts retreat downward ( Fig . 14 ) .
Elsewhere , however , lower temperature quartz - kaolinite is the dominant overprint assemblage ( e . g . , Caspiche , northern Chile ) .
Nevertheless , in some porphyry Cu deposits , these halo metals , particularly Zn , occur as late - stage veinlet arrays overprinting the Cu - dominated cores rather than peripherally ( e . g . , Chuquicamata ; Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) .
The Cu / Au ratios of lithocap - hosted , highsulfidation mineralization tend to decrease upward , with the result that most major high - sulfidation Au ( ± Ag ) deposits occur in the shallow parts of lithocaps , commonly - but not always - with their tops immediately below the former paleowater table positions ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
In most systems , any volcanism ceases before porphyry Cu system formation is initiated , although relatively minor eruptive activity , such as dome emplacement , may be either interspersed with or perhaps even accompany ascent of the magmatic aqueous phase ( e . g . , Bingham and Yanacocha ; Deino and Keith , 1997 ; Longo and Teal , 2005 ) .
During the protracted potassic alteration event ( s ) that affect the early and intermineral porphyries and their immediate wall rocks , heated external water , largely meteoric but possibly containing a connate component ( e . g . , Bingham ; Bowman et al . , 1987 ) , generates the peripheral propylitic alteration , mainly by moderate - temperature hydration reactions ( Meyer and Hemley , 1967 ) .

Focused ascent of the reactive fluid through fault and other permeable conduits leads to generation of the vuggy , residual quartz cores ( if pH is < 2 ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) , flanked by zoned advanced argillic halos ( Table 2 ; see above ) indicative of partial outward fluid penetration , neutralization , and cooling .

However , much of the Au precipitates in the shallower parts of lithocaps because of the greater likelihood of sharp drops in Au solubility caused by either intense boiling in upflow conduits or admixture of the ascendant liquid with cool , inflowing ground water ; in some cases , the latter appears to originate from the vadose zone ( see below ) where it was steam heated Heinrich , 2005 , and references therein ; Figs . 6 , 14 ) .

Exceptionally ferrous Fe - rich rocks , relatively uncommon in most arc terranes , also appear to assist with development of high hypogene Cu grades as well as maximizing the wall rock - hosted component of the deposit ( e . g . , El Teniente , Resolution , Oyu Tolgoi ) .
They commonly occur as tabular veins overprinting porphyry Cu deposits , like those at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) , Escondida ( Ojeda , 1986 ) , Chuquicamata ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ) , and Collahuasi , northern Chile ( Masterman et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Nevertheless , in many porphyry Cu deposits , it is fluid cooling over the ~ 550º to 350 °C range , assisted by fluid - rock interaction , that is largely responsible for precipitation of the Cu , in low sulfidation - state Cu - Fe sulfide assemblages , plus any Au ( e . g . , Ulrich et al . , 2001 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The large size of some porphyry Cu systems , with maximum radii of ~ 8 km ( e . g . , Fig . 9 ) and maximum areal extents approaching 100 km 2 ( Singer et al . , 2008 ) , complicates their effective exploration because attention is unavoidably focused on the more prominently altered parts , such as pyrite - bearing porphyry Cu mineralization , pyrite halos , and pyrite - rich lithocaps .
One or more subparallel belts constitute porphyry Cu or epithermal Au provinces , several of which give rise to global - scale anomalies for Cu ( e . g . , northern Chile - southern Peru , southwestern North America ) or Au ( northern Peru ; Sillitoe , 2008 ) .

At the district scale , porphyry Cu systems and their contained deposits tend to occur as clusters or alignments that may attain 5 to 30 km across or in length , respectively .

The legend explains the temporal sequence of rock types , with the porphyry stock predating maardiatreme emplacement , which in turn overlaps lithocap development and phreatic brecciation .
Distal ore formation in porphyry Cu systems is less common in igneous or siliciclastic wall rocks , within propylitic halos , where fault - and fracture - controlled , subepithermal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag ± Au veins of currently limited economic importance tend to be developed ( e . g . , Mineral Park ; Eidel et al . , 1968 and Los Bronces - Río Blanco ; Figs . 5a , 6 ) .

Locally , however , the intermediate - sulfidation and both Cor dilleran lode and shallow , disseminated high - sulfidation mineralization types display transitional mineralogic relationships , as exemplified by the so - called Main Stage veins at Butte ( Meyer et al . , 1968 ) and the disseminated A and Link Au zones at Wafi - Golpu ( Leach , 1999 ; Ryan and Vigar , 1999 )
The local occurrence of vein dikes ( see above ) , as well as recognition of coexisting melt and aqueous fluid inclusions in early quartz veinlets ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , confirms that magma and mineralizing fluid commonly coexist , although markedly different densities dictate that they typically separate .

( 3 ) how important are mafic magmas in the development of the parental magma chambers beneath porphyry Cu systems , and what material contributions do they make to the systems themselves ?
There , distinction from phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias may be difficult because of texture obliteration caused by intense advanced argillic alteration ( e . g . , Pascua - Lama ) .

Volumes of the different alteration types vary markedly from deposit to deposit .
In such situations , the advanced argillic alteration may be 1 to > 2 m . y .
However , because of the low pressure of the lithocap environment and , hence , low metal - transporting capability of the absorbed vapor ( see above ) , the resultant acidic fluid is unlikely to produce much mineralization , thereby possibly accounting for the barren status of many lithocaps ( e . g . , Hedenquist et al . , , 2000Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Lateral transfer of such liquids beyond lithocaps to form intermediate - sulfidation epithermal deposits is also dependent on the existence of suitable permeability , which in a few cases is the direct continuation of that utilized by the contiguous high - sulfidation mineralization ( e . g . , Colquijirca , Tintic ) .
( 12 ) why do only a few lithocaps appear to develop intermediate - sulfidation epithermal precious metal deposits on their peripheries ?
It may be speculated that crustal compression aids development of large mid - to upper - crustal magma chambers ( Takada , 1994 ) capable of efficient fractionation and magmatic fluid generation and release , especially at times of rapid uplift and erosional unroofing ( Sillitoe , 1998 ) , events which may presage initiation of stress relaxation ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Gow and Walshe , 2005 ) .
Alternatively , for up to several kilometers beyond porphyry Cu deposits , they comprise structurally controlled replacements and hydrothermal breccias , either in volcanic rocks as at Lepanto in the Mankayan district ( Garcia , 1991 ; , Nena in the Frieda River district , Papua New Guinea ( Espi , 1999 ) , and Chelopech , Bulgaria ( Chambefort and Moritz , 2006 ) or , where lithocaps impinge on carbonate rocks , as deposits like Smelter in the Marcapunta sector at Colquijirca ( Vidal and Ligarda , 2004 ; Bendezú and Fontboté , 2009 ) .

In contrast , much larger tonnage , disseminated Au ± Ag orebodies are more typical of the shallower ( < 500 m ) parts of lithocaps ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , as exemplified by Yanacocha ( Harvey et al . , 1999 ) and Pascua - Lama ( Chouinard et al . , 2005 ) , although much deeper development of disseminated Cu - Au deposits is also relatively common ( e . g . , Tampakan ; Rohrlach et al . , 1999 ) .

The abovecited examples of mineralogic transitions between high - and intermediate - sulfidation mineralization provide support for this mechanism .
Interrelationships between porphyry intrusions and carbonate host rocks can influence the form and size of skarn deposits , typically with above - average Cu tenors .

They are distinguished from the phreatomagmatic diatreme breccias by several features ( Table 1 ) , particularly the absence of tuffaceous material .
At several localities , the advanced argillic alteration at the bottoms of lithocaps displays a characteristic patchy texture , commonly defined by amoeboid pyrophyllite patches embedded in silicified rock ( e . g . , Escondida and Yanacocha ; Padilla Garza et al . , 2001 ; Gustafson et al . , 2004 ) .
Irrespective of whether the Cu - bearing sulfide minerals are coprecipitated with veinlet quartz or , as generally seems to be the case , introduced paragenetically later ( e . g . , Redmond et al . , 2001Redmond et al . , , 2004 , a particularly strong correlation exists between quartz veinlet intensity and metal content in many porphyry Cu deposits , particularly in Au - rich examples ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
in the case of long - lived porphyry Cu systems , whereas elsewhere the loci of intrusive and hydrothermal activity migrate , either systematically or randomly , to give rise to the porphyry Cu and epithermal Au deposit clusters and alignments discussed above .
By the time that the late - mineral porphyry phases are added to porphyry Cu stocks or dike swarms , fluid ascent from the parental magma chambers has all but ceased , and K and metal availability is too limited to generate appreciable potassic alteration and mineralization .
The existence of even minor erosional remnants of steam - heated horizons and their chalcedonic bases , generated above and at paleowater tables , respectively , guarantees that the appropriate near - surface level is preserved ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .
Simplified sections through high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits to illustrate the wide variation in alteration zoning patterns and their relationship to porphyry intrusions and Cu tenor .
The immediately premineral , early porphyries and their contiguous host rocks contain the highest grade mineralization in most deposits although , exceptionally , the earliest phase can be poorly mineralized ( e . g . , Grasberg ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ) .

However , if the overprinted high - sulfidation assemblages also contain appreciable arsenical sulfosalts , a situation that becomes increasingly likely upward in most systems , the resultant mineralization is less desirable because it is not only refractory if subjected to bacterial heap leaching but also generates As - rich flotation concentrates that may prove difficult to market .

Coalescence of closely spaced porphyry Cu deposits enhances size potential ( e . g . , H14 - H15 at Reko Diq ; Perelló et al . , 2008 ) Development of wall rock - hosted orebodies alongside porphyry Cu deposits is most common where receptive carbonate rocks are present ( Fig . 6 ) .
High water contents result in magmas becoming saturated with the aqueous phase , into which the ore metals can partition efficiently ; and high oxidation state suppresses magmatic sulfide , such as pyrrhotite , precipitation , a process that may cause sequestration of metals before they can partition into the aqueous phase .
Deposit types include proximal Cu ± Au and , less commonly , distal Au and / or Zn - Pb skarns ( e . g . , Meinert , 2000 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) ; more distal , carbonate - replacement ( chimney - manto ) , massive sulfide bodies dominated by either Cu ( e . g . , Superior district , Arizona and Sepon district , Laos [ Fig . 9c ] ; Paul and Knight , 1995 ; Loader , 1999 ) or , more commonly , Zn , Pb , Ag ± Au ( e . g . , Recsk , Hungary ; Kisvarsanyi , 1988 ) beyond the skarn front ( Fig . 6 ) ; and , uncommonly , sediment - hosted ( distal - disseminated ; Cox and Singer , 1990 ) Au concentrations on the fringes of the systems ( e . g . , Barneys Canyon and Melco , Bingham district ; Babcock et al . , 1995 ; Gunter and Austin , 1997 ; Cunningham et al . , 2004 ; Fig . 9a ) .

A broadly parallel increase in sulfidation state of the fluids results in changes in the sulfide assemblage from chalcopyrite ( cp ) - bornite ( bn ) , through chalcopyrite - pyrite ( py ) and pyrite - bornite , to pyrite - enargite ( en ) or pyrite - covellite ( cv ) , as charted for several deposits by Einaudi et al .

Whether or not these and other deposit clusters and alignments owe their existence to fundamental faults or lineaments ( see above ; Richards , 2000 ) , it is often not obvious if exploration - commonly focused on areas of pre - or postmineral cover - should target broadly equidimensional deposit arrays or arc - parallel or arc - transverse alignments , particularly when only one or two deposits have been defined .
Notwithstanding the ubiquity of porphyry Cu belts , major deposits may also occur in isolation or at least as distant outliers of coherent belts and provinces ( e . g . , Pebble in Alaska , Butte in Montana , and Bingham in Utah ; Sillitoe , 2008 ; Fig . 1 ) .
This situation implies that the underlying parental plutons have protracted life spans , albeit intermittent in some cases , with porphyry Cu formation taking place above them at different places over time .
Light stable isotope studies of sodic - calcic alteration in the Yerington district support the involvement of externally derived brine from the host sedimentary sequence , although the albite - actinolite alteration there is magnetite destructive ( Carten , 1986 ; .
Eventually ( right side ) , the sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration may cause variable degrees of Cu ± Au removal , but hypogene Cu enrichment is also possible in the former .

If this scenario is correct , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity ( 5−20 wt % NaCl equiv ) liquid in the 350° to 250 °C temperature range ascends directly from the parental chambers into overlying porphyry Cu systems ( Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Therefore , recognition of even weakly developed mineralization of a single type may help to direct exploration for potentially higher grade mineralization of other types elsewhere in the system .
Continuity between some of these carbonate rock - hosted deposits is possible ; for example , transitions from proximal Cu - Au to distal Au skarn in the Copper Canyon district ( Cary et al . , 2000 ) and distal Zn - Pb - Cu - Ag skarn to carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag at Groundhog , Central district , New Mexico ( Meinert , 1987 ) .

Narrow , mineralogically complex quartz - sericite - K - feldspar - biotite veinlets with centimeterscale halos defined by the same minerals ( ± andalusite ± corundum ) along with abundant , finely disseminated chalcopyrite ± bornite characterize the changeover from group 1 to 2 veinlets in a few deposits , although they may have been confused elsewhere with D - type veinlets because of their eye - catching halos ; they are termed early dark micaceous ( EDM ) halo veinlets at Butte ( Meyer , 1965 ; Brimhall , 1977 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) and Bingham ( Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and type 4 ( T4 ) veinlets at Los Pelambres ( Atkinson et al . , 1996 ; Perelló et al . , 2007 ) .

The A - type veinlets range from stockworks to subparallel , sheeted arrays , the latter particularly common in Au - rich porphyry deposits ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
There is a strong suggestion that comagmatic volcanism may be inhibited in some major porphyry Cu belts as a result of their characteristic contractional tectonic settings , as in the FIG .
Mining and deep drilling in a few large porphyry Cu deposits show that mineralized intrusions have vertical extents of > 2 km ( e . g . , Chuquicamata and Escondida , northern Chile , and Grasberg ) and , based on evidence from the steeply tilted systems , perhaps ≥4 km ( Dilles , 1987 ; Seedorff et al . , 2008 ; Fig . 6 ) .
Several criteria , in addition to metal contents and ratios ( Cu / Au / Mo ) and intensity of veining , alteration , and mineralization , are used to distinguish the relative ages of porphyry intrusions : younger phases truncate veinlets in , are chilled against , and contain xenoliths of older phases ( Fig . 7 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ) .

However , apparent confinement of hypogene Cu enrichment ( see above ) to sericitic alteration overprinting rocks cut by quartz veinlet stockworks that formerly contained chalcopyrite ± bornite may suggest that a large component of the Cu in the newly generated high sulfidation - state assemblages is derived by relatively localized remobilization ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) .

However , should the search be for high - sulfidation Au deposits , the shallow parts of lithocaps may have the best potential for the discovery of large , albeit commonly low - grade orebodies .

This is particularly the case for Au , which tends to be removed and dissipated during the formation of lower temperature , pyrite - bearing alteration assemblages ( Gammons and Williams - Jones , 1997 ; Sillitoe , 2000 ; Kesler et al . , 2002 ) .

Where steeply dipping , receptive carbonate rock sequences abut steep porphyry stock contacts , vertically extensive proximal skarn bodies may form ( e . g . , the > 1 , 600 - m extent of the Ertsberg East ( Gunung Bijih ) Cu - Au deposit , Indonesia ; Coutts et al . , 1999 ) .
In a minority of cases , however , diatremes ( e . g . , Grasberg , Galore Creek , and Boyongan - Bayugo , Philippines ; MacDonald and Arnold , 1994 ; Enns et al . , 1995 ; Braxton et al . , 2008 ) or tuff - filled depressions presumably fed by one or more subjacent diatremes ( e . g . , Resolution ) are early features that act as receptive wall rocks to the main alteration and mineralization .
At the early stage ( left side ) , magma is present at the top of the parental chamber , a single - phase , low - to moderate - salinity liquid exits the magma and undergoes phase separation during ascent to generate immiscible hypersaline liquid and vapor , which generate potassic alteration plus contained low sulfidation - state porphyry Cu ± Au mineralization .
The empirical relationship between well - established magmatic ( including postcollisional ) arcs containing major , highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits and contractional tectonic settings characterized by high surface uplift and denudation rates ( see above ) may prove to be a useful criterion for selection of underexplored arc segments with incompletely tested potential . Contractional settings are strongly suggested where entire arc segments possess only minor volcanic rock volumes contemporaneous with the development of porphyry Cu systems , particularly where lithocaps are widely preserved as evidence for shallow erosion .
The rheology and composition of the host rocks may strongly influence the size , grade , and type of mineralization generated in porphyry Cu systems .
The clustering or alignment of both porphyry Cu and high - sulfidation Au deposits has been shown time and again to be a highly effective exploration concept .
Nevertheless , it also characterizes the centrally located zones of some porphyry Cu stocks ( e . g . , Koloula , Solomon Islands and Island Copper , British Columbia ; Chivas , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995 ; Arancibia and Clark , 1996 ) .
Furthermore , even where appreciable Au is retained in chlorite - sericite assemblages , flotation recoveries are commonly lower ( < 60 % ) than for ore from potassic zones ( > 80 % ) because some of the Au originally in solid solution and encapsulated in and attached to chalcopyrite ± bornite becomes linked to introduced pyrite ( Sillitoe , 2000 ) .
The alteration - mineralization in the porphyry Cu deposits is zoned upward from barren , early sodic - calcic through potentially ore - grade potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic , to advanced argillic , the last of these constituting the lithocaps , which may attain > 1 km in thickness if unaffected by significant erosion .
They span a range of compositions from calc - alkaline diorite and quartz diorite through granodiorite to quartz monzonite ( monzogranite ) , and alkaline diorite through monzonite to , uncommonly , syenite ( e . g . , Galore Creek , British Columbia ; Enns et al . , 1995 ) .
When planning exploration programs for porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , skarn Cu ± Au , or high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits , the preeminent ore types hosted by porphyry Cu systems , the choice is between selection of ( 1 ) mature , wellendowed Cu or Au belts , ( 2 ) emerging belts with less obvious metallogenic credentials but having at least one important deposit of the type that is sought , or ( 3 ) frontier terranes with geologic conditions that are perceived to imply potential . On the basis of recent exploration successes , the first choice has been shown to be a wise one , as witnessed by the strings of high - sulfidation Au and Au - rich porphyry discoveries that now define the El Indio - Maricunga belt in northern Chile and Cajamarca - Huaraz belt in northern Peru ( Sillitoe , 2008 ) , as well as discovery of the Resolution porphyry Cu - Mo deposit in the southwestern North American Cu province after a 100 - year exploration history ( Manske and Paul , 2002 ) .

It also needs to be emphasized that few porphyry Cu systems , whatever their exposure level , contain the full spectrum of potential ore types depicted in Figure 6 , although the Bingham district with its porphyry Cu - Au - Mo , Cu - Au skarn , carbonate - replacement Zn - Pb - Ag - Au , and sediment - hosted Au deposits ( Babcock et al . , 1995 ) and the more shallowly exposed Lepanto district with its porphyry Cu - Au , high - sulfidation Cu - Au - Ag , and intermediate - sulfidation Au - Ag - Cu deposits ( Hedenquist et al . , 2001 ) are exceptionally well endowed in this regard .

Varied relationships are observed between porphyry Cu systems and precursor plutons , which are typically multiphase , equigranular intrusions , commonly of batholithic dimensions and dioritic to granitic compositions ; they are not only spatially , but also temporally and probably genetically related to porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au formation ( Fig . 4 ) .
At the deposit scale , particularly in the por - phyry Cu environment , early - formed features commonly , but by no means always , give rise to the best ore - bodies .

The main geochemical difference between the Cu - Au zones in porphyry Cu deposits and those in the overlying lithocaps is the elevated As ( ± Sb ) contents consequent upon the abundance of the Cu sulfosalts in the latter .
This scenario implies episodic but focused magma and fluid ascent for as long as ~ 5 m . y .
Current orthodoxy maintains that the early sodic - calcic alteration observed in some porphyry Cu deposits is a product of inflowing brine sourced from host - rock sequences ( Carten , 1986 ; Seedorff et al . , 2005Seedorff et al . , , 2008 , in keeping with theoretical predictions for fluids following heating paths under silicate - rock−buffered conditions ( e . g . , Giggenbach , 1984Giggenbach , , 1997 .
Under these lower temperature conditions , sericitic ± chlorite - sericite alteration zones begin to form from a deeply derived , single - phase aqueous liquid generated by one or both of the methods ( see text ) postulated by and Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) .

The fluid most likely to lead to appreciable high - sulfidation Au ± Ag ± Cu mineralization in the relatively barren , earlyformed lithocaps is the low - to moderate - salinity , H 2 S - rich , aqueous liquid that produces the underlying sericitic zones Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Heinrich , 2005 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Fig . 14 ) .

Where telescoping is limited , however , the lithocaps and potassic - altered porphyry stocks may be separated by 0 . 5 to 1 km ( Sillitoe , 1999b ) , a gap typically occupied by pyritic chlorite - sericite alteration ( Fig . 11 ) .
Locally , early A - type veinlets displaying aplitic centers or along - strike transitions to aplite and / or aplite porphyry ( vein dikes ) are observed ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ; Heithersay et al . , 1990 ; Lickfold et al . , 2003 ; Rusk et al . , 2008a ) .
The D - type veinlets , far more abundant in porphyry Cu - Mo than Cu - Au deposits ( Fig . 13a ) , may also occur as structurally controlled swarms ( e . g . , El Abra ; Dean et al . , 1996 ) , a characteristic particularly evident in the case of the late - stage , meter - scale , enargitebearing , massive sulfide veins spanning the upper parts of porphyry Cu deposits and lower parts of overlying lithocaps ( Fig . 6 ; see above ) .

In the more highly telescoped systems , where sericitic and / or advanced argillic assemblages overprint appreciable volumes of potassic and / or chlorite - sericite alteration within porphyry intrusions , the ensuing effects can be varied .
These transverse features , possibly reflecting underlying basement structures , may facilitate ascent of the relatively small magma volumes involved in porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , Clark , 1993 ; Richards , 2000 ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich , Mopoor porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
The B - type veinlets are typically absent from Au - rich porphyry Cu deposits ( Fig . 13b ) .
( 11 ) what is the fluid regime responsible for metal zoning in lithocaps , and why are so many lithocaps apparently barren ?
Group 1 and 2 veinlets are mainly emplaced during potassic alteration , whereas group 3 accompanies the chlorite - sericite , sericitic , and deep advanced argillic overprints .
Open - space filling is also uncommon , except in phreatic breccias and unusual , isolated veins ( e . g . , La Mejicana alunite - pyrite - famatinite vein at Nevados del Famatina ; Lozada - Calderón and McPhail , 1996 ) .
Nevertheless , bearing in mind that most observed lithocaps are only erosional remnants , exploration should focus first around their peripheries in case a porphyry Cu deposit has already been exposed .
Catastrophically explosive volcanism , particularly ash - flow caldera formation , is normally incompatible with synchronous porphyry Cu and superjacent epithermal Au deposit formation , because magmatic volatiles are dissipated during the voluminous pyroclastic eruptions rather than being retained and focused in a manner conducive to ore formation ( Sillitoe , 1980 ; Pasteris , 1996 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Richards , 2005 ) .

The same situation is also apparent in several giant high - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits generated in thickened crust during tectonic uplift , such as Pascua - Lama and Veladero , northern Chile - Argentina , where the near absence of contemporaneous volcanism is more certain ( Bissig et al . , 2001 ; Charchaflié et al . , 2007 ) given the much shallower erosion level , including partial paleosurface preservation ( see below ) .

Magmatic - hydrothermal breccias display a variety of textures ( Table 1 ) , which are mainly dependent on clast form and composition , clast / matrix ratio , matrix / cement constitution , and alteration type .
Therefore recognition of A - and B - type veinlets in sericitic or advanced argillic zones testifies unambiguously to the former presence of potassic alteration .
Even cursory inspection of Figure 6 shows clearly that erosion level is a fundamental control on the mineralization types that may be anticipated to occur in porphyry Cu systems .
Note scale difference between c and a , b , and d . The precursor plutons are considered as the mid - to uppercrustal crystallization sites of mafic to felsic magmas that ascended from deeper reservoirs before porphyry Cu systems were developed ( see Richards , 2003 ) .
( 9 ) what are the main mechanisms controlling the bulk Cu / Au / Mo ratios of porphyry Cu deposits ?
At first glance , using representative cross sections of alteration at four highgrade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits as examples ( Fig . 15 ) , these varied geometries are not easy to relate to a standard geologic model .
Note the common absence of B - and D - type veinlets from Au - rich porphyry Cu stockworks and M - , magnetite - bearing A - , and chlorite - rich veinlets from Mo - rich porphyry Cu stockworks .
Renewed neutralization of this same liquid on exiting the lithocap and / or aliquots of the deep liquid that bypass the lithocap entirely may give rise to peripheral intermediate - sulfidation ( IS ) epithermal mineralization .
As a consequence , the most distal and subtle ore types , sediment - hosted Au on the fringes of carbonate rockhosted districts and Zn - Pb - Ag ± Au−bearing intermediatesulfidation epithermal veins and carbonate - replacement bodies on the fringes of lithocaps attract less attention and may be easily missed .
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that certain lithologic units may enhance grade development in both porphyry Cu and related deposit types .
The early , intermineral , and late - mineral phases of the porphyry Cu stocks , which span the interval during which the porphyry Cu deposits formed , originate from increasingly greater depths in the progressively crystallizing parental chamber .
Field observations and theoretical calculations suggest that parental chambers with volumes on the order of 50 km 3 may be capable of liberating enough fluid to form porphyry Cu deposits , but chambers at least an order of magnitude larger are needed to produce giant systems , particularly where deposit clusters or alignments exist ( Dilles , 1987 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
The degree of overprinting is perhaps best appreciated in some magmatichydro thermal breccia bodies in which isolated magnetite aggregates occur as stranded remnants in sericitic or chloritesericite zones up to 1 km above the magnetite - cemented , potassic parts ( e . g . , Chimborazo , northern Chile ; Fig . 8 ) .
In other cases , however , there is evidence for an origin from hypersaline magmatic liquids , with the paucity of contained sulfide mineralization being due to excessively high temperatures and oxygen fugacities and the consequent deficiency of reduced S ( John , 1989 ; Clark and Arancibia , 1995 ; Lang et al . , 1995 ) .

Nevertheless , several temporally discrete porphyry Cu - bearing arcs may be superimposed on PORPHYRY COPPER SYSTEMS 5 0361 - 0128 / 98 / 000 / 000 - 00 $6 . 00 A preeminent example of spatial and temporal coincidence between a porphyry Cu belt and an intra - arc fault zone : the northern Chile part of the central Andean middle Eocene to early Oligocene porphyry Cu belt and Domeyko fault system ( summarized from Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit , northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Nevertheless , at a few localities , including the shallowly formed Marte porphyry Au deposit northern Chile , a comagmatic andesitic stratovolcano is still partially preserved , including parts of its unmodified lower depositional slopes ( or planèze ) .
Furthermore , there seems to be no obvious relationship between the size of porphyry Cu deposits and the duration of the intrusive activity , the latter seemingly being the main parameter defining the total hydrothermal life spans of porphyry Cu systems .
Group 3 also includes uncommon , but economically important massive chalcopyrite ± bornite ± chalcocite veinlets at the high - grade Grasberg ( Pollard and Taylor , 2002 ; I . Kavalieris , pers .

Isotopic dating , using the U - Pb zircon method , suggests that the multiphase porphyry intrusions in porphyry Cu systems can be assembled in as little as 80 , 000 years ( Batu Hijau , Indonesia ; Garwin , 2002 ) , but the process commonly takes much longer .
It is unlikely coincidental that at least half the ore at three of the highest grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits is hosted by such rocks : a gabbro - diabase - basalt complex at El Teniente ( Skewes et al . , 2002 ) , a Proterozoic diabase sill complex at Resolution , Arizona ( Ballantyne et al . , 2003 ) , and a tholeiitic basalt sequence in the Oyu Tolgoi district .
Effective study of these and other problems will require field - based geochemical and geophysical work and an array of evermore sophisticated laboratory equipment for high - precision fluid inclusion and trace element analysis , isotopic determinations , isotopic dating , and experimental work on fluid evolution and metal transport .

Arranged from probable oldest ( top ) to youngest ( bottom ) , except for propylitic that is lateral equivalent of potassic ; advanced argillic also forms above potassic early in systems ( Fig . 10 ) 3 Many veinlets in potassic , chlorite - sericite , and sericitic alteration contain anhydrite , which also occurs as late , largely monomineralic veinlets particularly , advanced argillic alteration are much less well developed in porphyry Cu deposits associated with alkaline than with calc - alkaline intrusions ( Lang et al . , 1995 ; Sillitoe , 2002 ; Holliday and Cooke , 2007 ) , reflecting control of the K + / H + ratio by magma chemistry ( e . g . , Burnham , 1979 ) .
Nevertheless , there is a prominent empirical relationship between broadly contractional settings , marked by crustal thickening , surface uplift , and rapid exhumation , and large , high - grade hypogene porphyry Cu deposits , as exemplified by the latest Cretaceous to Paleocene ( Laramide ) province of southwestern North America , middle Eocene to early Oligocene ( Fig . 2 ) and late Miocene to Pliocene belts of the central Andes , mid - Miocene belt of Iran , and Pliocene belts in New Guinea and the Philippines ( Fig . 1 ; Sillitoe , 1998 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ; Perelló et al . , 2003a ; Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rohrlach and Loucks , 2005 ; Sillitoe and Perelló , 2005 ; Perelló , 2006 ) .

However , at the shallower depths typical of most deposits ( < ~ 4 km ) , the mineralization is introduced by a two - phase fluid , comprising a small fraction of hypersaline liquid ( brine ) and a much larger volume of lowdensity vapor ( Fournier , 1999 ) , produced by either direct exsolution from the melt ( Shinohara , 1994 ) or , more typically , as the single - phase liquid decompresses , cools , and intersects its solvus ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ; Bodnar , 1995 ; Cline , 1995 ) .
And these geologic observations must further emphasize the relative timing of intrusion , brecciation , alteration , and mineralization events because isotopic dating techniques do not and may never have the required resolution .

Some investigators emphasize the importance of intersections between continentscale transverse fault zones or lineaments and arc - parallel structures for porphyry Cu formation , with the Archibarca and Calama - El Toro lineaments of northern Chile ( Richards et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 2 ) , the Lachlan Transverse Zone of New South Wales ( Glen and Walshe , 1999 ) , comparable features in New Guinea ( Corbett , 1994 ; Hill et al . , 2002 ) , and the much wider ( 160 km ) Texas lineament of southwestern North America ( Schmitt , 1966 ) being oft - quoted examples .
In a general way , the veinlets may be subdivided into three groups ( Table 2 ; Fig . 13 ) : ( 1 ) early , quartz - and sulfide - free veinlets containing one or more of actinolite , magnetite ( M type ) , ( early ) biotite ( EB type ) , and K - feldspar , and typically lacking alteration selvages ; ( 2 ) sulfide - bearing , granular quartz - dominated veinlets with either narrow or no readily recognizable alteration selvages ( A and B types ) ; and ( 3 ) late , crystalline quartz - sulfide veins and veinlets with prominent , feldspar - destructive alteration selvages ( including D type ) .

However , USTs are not consistently developed and , hence , do not provide a reliable means of subdividing porphyry Cu intrusion phases .
Modified from Sillitoe ( 1995bSillitoe ( , 1999bSillitoe ( , 2000 . impermeable seals around and / or above porphyry Cu deposits , resulting in high - grade ore formation ( e . g . , Grasberg ; Sillitoe , 1997 ) .
However , these life spans are orders of magnitude longer than the theoretically modeled times required for consolidation of individual porphyry intrusions ( < 40 , 000 yr ; Cathles , 1977 ; Cathles et al . , 1997 ) , porphyry Cu ore formation ( < 100 , 000 yr ; McInnes et al . , 2005 ) , or major potassic alteration events ( < 2 , 000 yr ; Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ; Cathles and Shannon , 2007 ) .
Irrespective of whether the porphyry Cu systems and contained deposits define clusters or alignments , their surface distributions are taken to reflect the areal extents of either underlying parental plutons or cupolas on their roofs .
range from restricted veneers near the stock or dike contacts to kilometer - scale zones , such as those in the mafic host lithologic units mentioned previously at El Teniente , Resolution , and Oyu Tolgoi .
But more fundamentally , however , we require better and more detailed documentation of geologic relationships in porphyry Cu systems worldwide , at all scales from the thin section to the entire system , and with greater emphasis on the regional to district context , particularly the relationship to igneous evolution .
Note that the high - grade ( > 1 . 5 % Cu ) zone at Chuquicamata includes a substantial , but unquantified , contribution from supergene enrichment .
Nevertheless , there is still a great deal to learn , a fact underscored by the relatively recent appreciation of the contrasting metal contents of coexisting hypersaline liquids and vapors ( Heinrich et al . , 1999 ; Ulrich et al . , 1999 ) and experimental determination of volatile S complexes as potentially important Cu - and Au - transporting agents throughout porphyry Cu systems ( Williams - Jones et al . , 2002 ; Nagaseki and Hayashi , 2008 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2008Pokrovski et al . , , 2009 .

The Bingham , Island Copper , and Agua Rica , Argentina , porphyry Cu - Au - Mo deposits are exceptions to this generalization because of their deep , centrally located molybdenite zones ( John , 1978 ; Perelló et al . , 1995Perelló et al . , , 1998 .
Nevertheless , many systems contain only one or two deposit types rather than a full zonal array ( Table 3 ) , with the presence of the more distal ore types at either porphyry Cu or lithocap levels being independent of the size and grade of the porphyry Cu deposits or prospects .
Notwithstanding the typical occurrence model depicted in Figure 6 and taking into account the critical importance of erosion level , the innumerable variations on the porphyry Cu genetic theme result in a broad spectrum of three - dimensional intrusion , breccia , alteration , and mineralization geometries ( e . g . , Gustafson and Hunt , 1975 ) .
A short , personalized selection of outstanding questions includes the following : ( 1 ) what are the fundamental mantle and / or crustal factors that dictate whether youthful arc segments are endowed with giant porphyry Cu systems ( e . g . , central Andes ) , only incipiently developed systems ( e . g . , Cascades , western United States ) , or none at all ( e . g . , Japan ) ?
It is acquisition of this geologic detail that is going to enable better application of laboratory techniques and , hopefully , further clarify the localization and evolutionary histories of porphyry Cu systems as well as the fundamental controls on large size and high hypogene grade .
For example , the 12 . 5 - Gt resource at Chuquicamata - Radomiro Tomic is confined to the 14 - km - long stock referred to above ( Ossandón et al . , 2001 ; Camus , 2003 ) , whereas perhaps only roughly 20 percent of the similarly sized El Teniente deposit and < 10 percent of the 1 . 5 - Gt El Abra deposit are hosted by the porphyry intrusions ( Camus , 1975 ( Camus , , 2003Ambrus , 1977 ) .
To date , the second choice could be taken to have been less successful , as shown by the lack of economically significant discoveries in the vicinities of the major but isolated Bingham , Butte , Pebble , and Oyu Tolgoi districts , although greenfield exploration is in its infancy in the still poorly defined magmatic arcs that host the last two of these .
Porphyry deposits supply most of the world ' s Cu and Mo resources .
Porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) - ( Au ) deposits are essentially magmatic - hydrothermal systems , which are generally initiated by injection of oxidized magmas saturated with metal - rich aqueous fluids , i . e . , the parental magmas need to be water rich and oxidized with most of the sulfur appearing as sulfate in the magma .

Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Sulfur is the most important geosolvent that controls the behavior of Cu and other chalcophile elements , due to high partition coefficients of chalcophile elements between sulfide and silicate melts .
Oxidation promotes the destruction of sulfides in the magma source , and thereby increases initial chalcophile element concentrations , forming sulfur - undersaturated magmas that can further assimilate sulfides during ascent .
Copper , Mo and Au act as incompatible elements in sulfide undersaturated magmas , leading to high chalcophile element concentrations in evolved magmas .
Hematite forms once sulfate reduction lowers the pH sufficiently , driving the oxidation potential of sulfate up to the hematite - magnetite oxygen fugacity ( HM ) buffer , which is ~ ΔFMQ + 4 .
Degassing of oxidized gases has also been proposed as a major process that is responsible for sulfate reduction .

Sulfide formed during sulfate reduction is efficiently scavenged by aqueous fluids , which transports metals to shallower depths , i . e . , the top of the porphyry and superjacent wallrock .

Porphyry deposits are hosts to one of the most important economic mineral associations ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Heinrich et al . , 2004 ; Mutschler et al . , 2010 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ) , accounting for ~ 80 % Cu and ~ 95 % Mo of the world ' s total reserves .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability of minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity ( fO 2 ) is an important geological parameter affecting the stability minerals , the evolution of magmas , and ore - forming processes .
Oxygen fugacity is very important to the behaviors of elements , but it is not a very precise term because in some cases , oxidation - reduction reactions do not involve any oxygen and the oxygen fugacity changes with pressure and temperature ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
Oxygen fugacity is usually notated as variations relative to a certain oxygen buffer .
Oxygen buffer refers to an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature and pressure ( Fig . 4 ) , i . e . , the oxygen fugacity of equilibration at a fixed pressure is defined by one of the curves in oxygen fugacity versus temperature diagrams .
Oxygen fugacity is of critical importance for the behaviors of elements .
Gas - mixing techniques have been commonly used for controlling oxygen fugacity of experiments conducted at high temperature Fig . 2 .

Sulfates , including anhydrite and alunite ( likely related to the epithermal mineralization ) are abundant in the mineralization system , and hematite formed during chlorite alteration , indicating high oxygen fugacity up to the HM buffer ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ) .
Porphyry Au deposits have oxygen fugacities similar to , if not higher than , porphyry Cu deposits .
El Teniente is a nested porphyry system that , according to different authors , was active for ~ 1 Ma ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Cannell et al . , 2003 ) up to more than 7 Ma ( 14 . 2 - 6 . 5 Ma ) ( Barra , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2011 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .
High Fe 2 O 3 / FeO values of 1 to 3 ( Garrido et al . , 2002 ) , quartz anhydrite veins and anhydritecemented breccias as well as gypsum clearly indicate high oxygen fugacities ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) .

Gangue minerals include quartz , muscovite , chlorite , calcite , minor epidote and anhydrite .
Hematite is also found in fluid inclusions in Dexing ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) .
Adakites found in the Qulong deposit are mixtures of continental and slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Zircon U - Pb dating shows that the formation ages of deposits within the Yulong ore belt range from 41 . 2 to 36 . 9 Ma , extending over a period of similar to 4 . 3 Ma , with formation ages decreasing systematically from northwest to southeast ( Liang et al . , 2006 ) .

Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , the behaviors of which are mainly controlled by reduced sulfur , e . g . , sulfide , hydrosulfide complexes ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or polysulfide ( e . g . , S 2 2− , S 3 − ) complexes ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Sulfur oxidation , sulfide under saturation and residual sulfide
Copper , Au and Mo are all chalcophile elements , with high partition coefficients between sulfide and melts , e . g . , D Cu = 1334 ± 210 ( Patten et al . , 2013 ) , D Au = 4500 - 11 , 200 ( Mungall and Brenan , 2014 ) , and D Mo = 0 . 15 - 5 . 15 ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) , respectively .

Partial melting of mantle peridotite may form melts with high Cu contents up to 350 ppm at high oxygen fugacities , at very low degree of partial melting ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Sulfide is the predominant sulfur species at oxygen fugacities lower than the FMQ buffer .
Sulfate proportions start to climb up above the FMQ buffer .
Arc magmas are probably neither unusually oxidized nor enriched in economic elements of interest , such as Cu ( Lee et al . , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
MORB has higher Cu contents ( 70 - 150 ppm ) ( Hofmann , 1988 ; Sun et al . , 2003b ) than other portions of the subducted oceanic slab , and thus is likely the main contributor to mineralization .
Slab melts formed at oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
MORB has an average S content of ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , from which it is easy to get the 22 % and 10 % partial melting needed to eliminate residual sulfides at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 and ΔFMQ + 2 , respectively .
Slab melts formed at ΔFMQ + 2 would have Cu contents more than twice as high as those formed at ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , and thus are considerably more favorable for Cu porphyry mineralization than mantle wedge melts .
Residual sulfide would exist until the entire slab melted , in which case sulfide would remain the predominant sulfur species in both melt and slab ( under reducing conditions of b ΔFMQ 0 ) .
Slab melts need to pass through the mantle lithosphere before they eventually are emplaced in the upper crust , and thus may lose or collect chalcophile elements by interactions with the mantle .
Sulfate reduction
Copper however , is a chalcophile element , and its final deposition during mineralization should be controlled mainly by the behavior of reduced sulfur ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013b .
Magmas from intraplate settings without influence from plate subduction are too reduced for mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Assimilation of reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation reducing sediments may lead to sulfate reduction as proposed by previous authors ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ( also see Section 4 ) .
Assimilation during magma chamber development may be better mixed and more homogenized .
Iron is a major element , with about 20 to 30 % of the total Fe in a typical porphyry occurring as ferrous iron , corresponding to an oxygen fugacity of less than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 18 ) .
Magnetite contains 66 . 7 % ferric iron , whereas hematite contains 100 % ferric iron .
Magnetite crystallization at Manus and many other arc volcanic rock series is coupled with dramatic decreases in Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , which is an important factor in understanding Au and Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

Oxygen fugacity of Manus glasses was calculated using the following equa - ( Kress and Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Hydrogen may further react with CO 2 and / or O 2 ( Eqs .
Pure hydrothermal hematite and specularite can often be determined to have formed during the late stages of porphyry mineralization ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , the specularite occurring in late stage veins at Dexing ( Fig . 13 ) .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behavior of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore it is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes of copper and a variety of other metal resources .

Reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are : 17 Mile Hill , Western Australia ; the Minãs de San Anton , Mexico ( Rowins , 2000 ) ; the Baogutu , northwestern China ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010aShen et al . , , 2012 ; North Fork Deposit , west Central Cascades , western North America ( Smithson and Rowins , 2005 ) ; Catface ; Vancouver Island , British Columbia ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; and a few other small porphyry deposits ( Rowins , 2000 ) .

Magnetite is nearly pure Fe 3 O 4 with less than 2 % Fe 2 TiO 4 component for Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and Baogutu ( An and Zhu , 2010 ; Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen and Pan , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2010a , b ) .
Ilmenite is more abundant than magnetite in the reduced porphyries ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , e . g . , all intrusive phases at Catface have accessory FeTi oxides with ilmenite / magnetite ratios of ~ 9 : 1 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , indicating a relatively reduced oxidation state , i . e . , belonging to the ilmenite - series ( Ishihara , 2004 ) .
Arc magmas usually have high oxygen fugacities ( Fig . 16 ) ( Arculus , 1994 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , 2013a , b ) , a condition that has been attributed to a variety Fig . 19 .
Arc magmas may also get oxidized during their evolution and ascent due to the following mechanisms ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005Lee et al . , , 2010 : ( 1 ) Changing oxygen buffers from graphite CO 2 ( CCO ) equilibria in the mantle source to Fe 3 + - Fe 2 + equilibria after graphite has been eliminated by partial melting ( Ballhaus , 1993 ) ; ( 2 ) Fractional crystallization of olivine and other minerals that favors ferrous iron over ferric iron ( Carmichael , 1991 ) ; ( 3 ) Assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 4 ) Degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) ; ( 5 ) Changing pH ( e . g . , lowering pH in a sulfate - sulfide system ) ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) ; ( 6 ) Magma recharging which preferentially enriches ferric Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .
Ridge subduction forms oxidized adakites by slab melting ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Ling et al . , 2009Ling et al . , , 2013 , followed by reduced A - type granites ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; H . Li et al . , 2012 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1994 ) .
Subduction of reducing sediments also reduces the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas , as seen in the Japan arc ( Takagi , 2004 ) .
Carbon rich sediments in the descending plate react with H 2 O to produce CH 4 and CO 2 ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Takagi , 2004 ) , or directly releases CH 4 by devolatilization ( Song et al . , 2009 ) .
Methane , however , may decouple from Sr , such that Sr isotopes cannot give a conclusive answer .
Degassing of SO 2 indeed has a significant influence on the oxygen fugacity in volcanic systems .
crystallizes below 950 °C in silicic calc - alkaline magmas ( Green and Watson , 1982 ) .
Degassing , however , should result in heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in the residual magmas .
Meteoritic water there should be very light in H and O isotope composition .
Meteoritic water there should be very light H and O isotope composition .
H - O isotopic data are from ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and ( Shen et al . , 2012 ) .
Low - salinity vapor shows strong seawater signals , which cannot represent " degassing " fluids .
Porphyry deposits related to reduced magmas have two other distinct characteristics .
Graphite and especially methane need not be considered coupled with silicate minerals , such that the reducing action of the graphite and methane is not proportionally related to the assimilation of silicates nor sulfides , thereby decoupling them from the Sr , Pb , and S isotopes .
Adakites along the eastern Pacific rim are mostly formed by slab melting ( Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a , b ) , which are likely to have high initial Cu contents , and are thus favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 .

Increasing Zn / Fe T ratios with decreasing MgO content argues that the high oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is acquired through magma evolution ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) , indicating that continuing chemical evolution during magma transport and emplacement may have major effects on the oxidized characteristics of arc magmas .

Magnetite crisis
Fluid extraction , however , is different from degassing , and thus Se provides no constraints on the process .

Oxygen fugacity and open systems
Sulfides formed through sulfate reduction are released into magmatic fluids , where they scavenge chalcophile elements Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Hydrothermal magnetite and even hematite may also form in fluids released from arc volcanic magmas , e . g . , Manus glasses , releasing H + .
Metals can be leached out as far as there is enough water circulation .
Adakite , slab melting , ridge subduction and porphyry Cu deposits
Adakite was initially named for rocks formed through partial melting of subducted young oceanic crust ( b25 Ma , represented by midocean ridge basalt , MORB ) ( Defant and Drummond , 1990 ; Kay , 1978 ) .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to produce adakites , e . g . , partial melting of the lower continental crust ( Chung et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2004 ; Guo et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2002Xu et al . , , 2006Zhang et al . , 2001b ) or underplated new crust ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Martin , 1999 ) , or by fractional crystallization of normal arc magmas ( Castillo , 2006 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Fractional crystallization of garnet and / or amphibole plays no positive role in Cu mineralization , either ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
Adakite formation through slab melting , on the other hand , does favor porphyry Cu mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2011Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) .

Oceanic crust has a much higher Cu abundance ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) than the mantle ( 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) or the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) .
Normal arc rocks form by partial melting of peridotite from the mantle wedge .
Partial melting of mantle peridotite can easily eliminate residual sulfide even under reducing conditions , e . g . , by ~ 20 % partial melting at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Alterations
Porphyry deposits have very well developed alteration zones that typically affect several cubic kilometers of rock ( Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Titley , 1981 ) ( Fig . 30 ) , which is of critical importance to understanding porphyry mineralization processes and improving their exploration .
Alteration is mainly controlled by pH values of the ore - forming fluids ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

At oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 to + 2 . 5 , the more oxidizing the system , the higher the S contents in the magmas , and thus high oxygen fugacity is the most efficient way to eliminate residual sulfides ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

At higher oxygen fugacity , no residual sulfides can be expected unless there is additional sulfur added from the subducting slab , which in actuality is probably the case .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur in magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
At oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 , most of the sulfur magmas is present as sulfate , and such magmas usually have higher contents of total S and chalcophile elements .
In highly oxidized porphyry magmas , sulfate , CO 2 and H 2 O are the dominant species , which are already oxidized and thus cannot reduce sulfate to sulfide , leaving ferrous iron as the only probable reducing agent ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
In magma system , this is better described as oxidation of FeO by sulfate or another oxidant ( Eq .
In fluids , the reactions can be described by Eqs .
For oxidized magmas , as discussed in Section 3 , excess sulfur is precipitated in the form of sulfate , leaving behind less residual sulfide , such that Cu , Au and other chalcophile elements become enriched in magmas ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .

The S abundance in the primitive mantle is estimated to be about 200 - 250 ppm ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , and about 150 ppm in depleted mantle ( Lorand , 1990 ; Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .

For slab melts formed at melting degrees higher than that require for SCSS , they would be undersaturated in sulfide and thus could assimilate more sulfides and chalcophile elements from the surrounding mantle while ascending , depending on the partitioning relationships between melt and residual sulfide in the mantle .

The Kula - Farallon ridge in the northeastern Pacific began descending under the North American continent in Alaska in the Late Cretaceous ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ; Scharman et al . , 2012 ) , and then between 62 and 11 Ma migrated southward ( Cole and Stewart , 2009 ; Cole et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2008 ) , forming a semi - continuous forearc magmatic belt from Alaska to Oregon ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) .
The Catface porphyry may have ascended through and interacted with graphite - rich reducing country rock known to exist in the region ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The low apatite SO 3 content , whole rock Fe 2 O 3 / FeO , and fluid compositions indicate a low fO 2 of ~ NNO for the magma and NNO - NNO − 2 for associated hydrothermal fluid ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2010b ) .

The H isotopes of fluid inclusions from Baogutu have very low δD values ( Shen et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , which are much lower than for either magmatic fluids or metamorphic fluids ( Fig . 21 ) .
The heavy H of circum - Pacific volcanic gases , however , was originally explained as having arisen from the addition of seawater to the gases ( Giggenbach , 1992a ) .
The systematically lighter H coupled with a slightly lighter O can best be explained by the addition of meteoritic water .
The 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratio of the Catface intrusions is 0 . 704 , whereas those of the graphiterich metasediments of the Pacific Rim terrane range from 0 . 706 to 0 . 708 ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The total iron ( expressed as Fe 2 O 3 ) content ranges from 2 . 25 wt . % to 5 . 53 wt . % for the Catface porphyry .
One carbon atom reduces 4 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
The homogenous SO 3 in apatite may simply be due to an early reduction of the magmas , before apatite crystallization .

HDP = hornblende diorite porphyry ; GDP = Granodiorite porphyry ; D = diorite .
Many epithermal deposits , however , are not linked to porphyry deposits .
This magnetite crisis is taken as a main process that leads to the formation of oreforming fluids , responsible for the Au and Cu mineralization of both epithermal and porphyry deposits ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004aSun et al . , , 2013a ) ( see also Section 3 ) : Sulfate is reduced to sulfide during magnetite crystallization , forming hydrosulfide complexes , which scavenge chalcophile elements into fluids and subsequently transport the metals to favorable places for forming deposits ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

How do Cu and Au get enriched in reduced magmas ?
If the magma at Catface was reduced during degassing of SO 3 , there should be compositional zonation in the apatite , which is not the case ( Fig . 20 ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Such a reduced porphyry Cu - Au mineralization model does not contradict the current understanding of porphyry Cu - Au formation .
During mantle melting , CO 2 is incompatible whereas C is compatible , and graphite may be consumed through oxidation melting ( Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
Normal arc melts are not systematically more enriched in Cu than MORB , either ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .

Because sulfide is denser than silicate melt , it would tend to sink , which is more likely to occur during the mineralization of Cu - Ni deposits , rather than porphyry deposits .
All the sulfate reduction reactions provide S 2 − , which promotes mineralization , forming chalcopyrite ( Eq .

Given that ferrous iron is the most important reductant that is responsible for sulfate reduction during porphyry mineralization , the highest oxygen fugacity favorable for porphyry mineralization is the HM buffer .
Moreover , oxygen fugacity controlled by the Ni - NiO buffer is quite important for the oxidation states of many elements , e . g . , sulfur in the fluids is mostly as H 2 S at the oxygen fugacity of NNO , but SO 2 and SO 3 appear when the oxygen fugacity increases by 0 . 5 log unit ( Binder and Keppler , 2011 ) .
And how do oxygen fugacities change during porphyry mineralization ?
Five major porphyries , which contain most of the Cu reserves so far discovered in the belt , are located in a narrow , elongated domain of approximately 50 km long and 10 km wide and are closely associated with Cenozoic high potassium intrusive rocks ( Liang et al . , 2006 ( Liang et al . , , 2007 .

Instead of primary hematite , magnetite , and sulfate ( e . g . , anhydrite , gypsum ) that are frequently seen in oxidized porphyries , these " reduced " porphyry Cu - Au deposits contain abundant hypogene pyrrhotite , and commonly have carbonic - rich ore fluids with substantial proportions of CH 4 , clearly indicating a reducing condition ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Moreover , apatite from the Catface has a homogenous S content throughout the crystal ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which argues against major degassing induced S loss during magma evolution .
Most of the ferric Fe will be transferred into the melt because ferric Fe is more incompatible than ferrous Fe ( Lee et al . , in press ) .

Because the anhydrite - rich stock is isotopically similar to all the other igneous rocks of the late Miocene deposit ( Baker et al . , 2011 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ) formed at a time of regional compressive deformation , it has been proposed that an oxidized parent magma in the large productive magma chamber was undergoing igneous fractionation at that time .
Most of the sulfur in the magmas is present as sulfate at ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 11 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 .
The average S concentration in MORB is ~ 1000 ppm ( O ' Neill and Mavrogenes , 2002 ) , while laboratory experimental measurements have determined the S content at sulfide saturation in basalts to be 1300 ppm at oxygen fugacities of ΔFMQ 0 ( Jugo , 2009 ) .

Therefore , partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs forms magmas with high Cu contents ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , which plausibly explains the close associations between adakites , especially formed during ridge subductions , and porphyry Cu deposits .

Formation of reduced porphyry deposits
Meanwhile , ridge subduction induced compression and consequent uplift and erosion occurred , which favored the exposure of the porphyry deposit .
Therefore , S - Pb isotopes cannot place any decisive constraints on the role of assimilation in forming the deposit .

The grades of porphyry Cu and Au deposits associated with reduced magmas are comparable to , if not higher than , those associated with oxidized magmas ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Rowins , 2000 ) .
In contrast , Au may be selectively transferred into the vapor phase , allowing its transport from the deeper porphyry copper deposits to form shallower epithermal gold deposits ( Seo and Heinrich , 2013 ) .
Consequently , sulfate is reduced to sulfide , leaving behind Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

Nevertheless , porphyry deposits are usually mineralized in the whole upper portion of the pluton , whereas interactions with country rocks are generally restricted at the interface , therefore assimilation of reducing sediments is not likely to be a decisive controlling process .
In addition to sulfate , hypogene hematite and specularite have also been reported in many porphyry deposits ( Baker et al . , 1997 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai , 2001 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004b ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Spry et al . , 1996 ; .

Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
Nevertheless , IOCG deposits are all highly oxidized , up to the HM buffer .
All five known porphyry deposits all together contain a total of more than 8 million tons of Cu and Mo reserves .
In contrast to mantle peridotite , MORB has sulfur abundances of about 1000 ppm , the effects of oxygen fugacity on residual sulfides , and , consequently , the Cu content in the melts , becomes much more obvious when considering partial melting of subducted oceanic slabs .

Note that most porphyry deposits have very small surface exposures , ranging in area from less than 1 km 2 ( mostly ) to ~ 5 km 2 ( in rare cases ) .
Nevertheless , assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries would result in heterogeneous reduction , because reduction is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface .
In the case of the Manus deposit in volcanic rocks , the Fe 3 + / ( total Fe ) did not change much during magnetite crystallization ( Fig . 18 ) .
Nevertheless , adakites formed by slab melting have much higher initial Cu contents than mantle - derived melts , and thus are favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2010 ( Sun et al . , , 2011 , suggesting that the reduced Catface porphyry could be a country rock hosting the ore deposit , rather than the causative porphyry .

Experiments on felsic liquids showed that the SO 3 content in apatite increase with increasing fO 2 from 0 . 04 wt . % at the FMQ buffer , up to N1 . 0 wt . % at the HM buffer ( Peng et al . , 1997 The SO 3 contents of Catface apatite are all lower than 0 . 15 wt . % , corresponding to oxygen fugacities below the NNO buffer .
In fact , most Cu should have come from slab melts ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012b , as also should have come the S and Pb , which are present in abundances similar to mantle derived magmas .
Moreover , the degassing of porphyries should be much less pronounced than the degassing of volcanic rocks .
Given that the solubility of sulfide is independent of oxygen fugacity , but increases with decreasing pressure under reducing conditions ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , the high proportions of S 2− cannot " isolate sulfides from the magma during migration " as proposed .
Therefore , the parental Catface magmas may have acquired a low fO 2 during their ascent through the crust .
Moreover , most mantle minerals , such as olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Moreover , most mantle minerals olivine , favor ferrous Fe over ferric Fe , and fractional crystallization of these minerals elevates the Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ( Carmichael , 1991 ) .
Nevertheless , high oxygen fugacities developed during magma evolution may provide little or no contribution to eliminating residual sulfides , and thus little contribution to porphyry mineralization .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation of hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Nevertheless , volcanic magma systems are much more open than porphyry systems , so that the formation hydrothermal iron oxides does not necessarily affect the oxygen fugacity of the arc magmas .
Given that the oceanic crust is very different from continental crust , slab melts can be distinguished from lower continental crust melts using geochemical criteria ( Ling et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012a ) .
Moreover , the crystallization of amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
Moreover , the crystallization amphibole plays no role in Cu mineralization .
The effects of oxygen fugacity on normal arc magmas have been nicely modeled ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
There are also several ridges ( most of which are aseismic , i . e . , island chains ) on the western Pacific plate ( Fig . 28 ) .
Consequently , slab melts becomes sulfur undersaturated at N5 % partial melting , with Cu contents of over 1000 ppm .
In principle , sulfate can also be reduced by assimilation of reducing sediments or degassing of oxidizing gases .

Small amount of residual sulfides can hold a large amount of Cu .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher the initial Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .

Therefore , the less the quantity of residual sulﬁde , the higher Cu contents in pri - mary magmas ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2004a , 2013b ) .
Moreover , some porphyry deposits are apparently associated with reduced magmas at ΔFMQ − 0 . 5 to − 3 ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
The presence of anhydrite and hematite indicates very high oxygen fugacities ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ; Mathur et al . , 2000 ) , near the HM buffer .
Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate its oxygen fugacity reached the magnetite - hematite buffer ( Fig . 11 ) .
Intergrowths of hematite and magnetite ( Fig . 10 ) indicate the oxygen fugacity of Qulong reached the HM buffer .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting of the depleted MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
Given that most MORB forms through ~ 10 % partial melting MORB mantle , it extracts about 100 ppm of sulfur from the mantle source , leaving behind ~ 150 ppm of sulfur as residual sulfide .
In case all the sulfur is present as sulfide , ~ 25 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all the residual sulfides from the mantle source at ΔFMQ 0 ( Fig . 3 ) ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) .
Instead , most porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with adakite Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2010Sun et al . , , 2012aThieblemont et al . , 1997 ) , or so called high Sr / Y porphyries ( Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Richards , 2011a ) .
In contrast , at oxygen fugacity even only slightly lower , e . g . , ΔFMQ + 1 . 7 , the highest Cu contents that can be reached through slab melting is ~ 450 ppm .
Therefore , the hematite - magnetite intergrowths may be taken as a possible ore indicator in future prospecting for copper deposits .
Therefore , the reduced Catface porphyry is likely to be a country rock that only hosts the deposit .
Accompanying the oblique subduction of the ridge ( Madsen et al . , 2006 ) , its two limbs separated , with a slab window opened in between .

Based on similar Zn / Fe T ratios of mantle peridotite and primitive arc magmas , it has been argued that primary arc magmas are not necessarily oxidized ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) .
Regardless , the oxygen fugacities of epithermal deposits have a much larger ranges than porphyry deposits .
Considering the geotherm ' s concave downward shape of subducting slabs , ridge subduction is the most favorable tectonic setting for slab melting in the Phanerozoic .
Over 90 % of the porphyry deposits are found at convergent margins , especially above active subduction zones , with much fewer occurrences at postcollisional or other tectonic settings .

Shapinggou . The Shapinggou porphyry Mo deposit is the largest
In general , the porphyry mineralization process consists of 3 major phases : ( 1 ) source , i . e . , extraction of chalcophile elements from the source ; ( 2 ) transportation and concentration of ore - forming elements ; and ( 3 ) deposition and fixation of the ore forming elements into orebodies .
When there is no residual sulfide in the mantle source , Cu and also other chalcophile elements become highly incompatible ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liu et al . , 2014 ) .
The reduction of ferric Fe through reaction with reducing materials , e . g . , graphite , in sediments was proposed as a potential factor responsible for the low fO 2 of the parental Catface magma .
Addition of such water should dramatically reduce the δD of the magma with a much lesser effect on O because magmas have low hydrogen contents and abundant oxygen contents .

There are indeed sulfide inclusions in mineral phenocryst from Manus glasses ( Fig . 25 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
In general , the alteration - mineralization zones become progressively younger upward ( Fig . 30 ) , consequently the shallower alteration - mineralization zones overprint deeper ones .

Also shown is the oxygen fugacity of the major mineral buffers ( HM , thick horizontal orange line ; NNO and FMQ , horizontal dashed lines ) and the neutrality point of pure water ( the vertical dashed line ) .
The solubility of sulfide in magmas is independent of oxygen fugacity below the FMQ buffer ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) , implying that most of the sulfur is removed in the form of sulfate under high oxygen fugacity ( Jugo , 2009 ) , and with its removal releasing much more of the chalcophile elements ( Lee et al . , 2012 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .

Note the range of oxygen fugacity for continental peridotite is much less than that of Bryant et al . ( 2007 ) , after removing peridotite samples from arc settings .
( 2 ) and ( 1 ) , HM and FMQ oxygen fugacity buffers do not change with pH .
In contrast , the oceanic plates subducting underneath the western North American continent are younger and have experienced only one Ocean Anoxic Event .
In contrast , the SO 3 contents of Baogutu apatite range from less than 0 . 1 wt . % to much higher than 0 . 2 wt . % , corresponding to varied oxygen fugacities , ranging from below the NNO buffer to close to the NNO + 1 .
This explains the Au - rich capping feature of many reduced porphyry deposits .
In contrast , the Cu contents of the asthenosphere ( ~ 30 ppm ) ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) and the continental crust ( ~ 27 ppm ) ( Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) are much lower than MORB ( ~ 100 ppm ) ( Sun et al . , 2003b ) , such that melt derived from them should have much lower Cu contents and be less favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , Re changes from incompatible ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b , c ) , to compatible ( Mallmann and O ' Neill , 2007 ) .
This explains why epithermal deposits are distributed in a variety of tectonic settings , ranging from mid - ocean ridges and backarc basins to arcs .

There are several subducting ridges along the east Pacific margin , e . g . , in Chile and Peru in the South America .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan , Izu - Bonin - Mariana , and other arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .
In addition , the oxygen fugacities in Japan arcs along the northwestern Pacific margins , are systematically lower than ΔFMQ + 2 ( Fig . 16a ) .

In addition to the oxidation of ferrous iron during the crystallization of magnetite and hematite , reducing wallrock may also contribute to sulfate reduction and mineralization .
Note , most of the porphyry deposits are distributed along convergent margins .
( 4 ) Why are some porphyry deposits associated with reducing magmas ?
The association of porphyry deposits with oxidized magmas
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
Others argued that ridge subduction is not responsible for making the supergiant porphyry deposit based on the inferred migration history of the arc ( Kay et al . , 2005 ) .
In contrast to the magma system , ferrous Fe is mainly present as Fe 2 + in aqueous fluids .
In this case , the oxidation of ferrous Fe is better described by Eq .
Consequently , the fO 2 increases during the reduction of sulfate ( Fig . 11 ) ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The association of porphyry deposits with reduced magmas
Nevertheless , the oceanic plate subducting underneath Japan is Cretaceous in age , which has experienced eight Ocean Anoxic Events ( Jenkyns , 2010 ) , and thus contains abundant organic rich sediments .
Consequently , the source porphyry becomes a low - grade sub - economic Cu - Au core or failed porphyry Cu system ( Rowins , 2000 ) , which is more or less similar to an epithermal ore system .
the recognition of reduced porphyry Cu - Au systems encourages a search for distal sites that are favorable for focusing and precipitating Au and Cu - rich vapors ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
This is followed by emplacement of the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
This is followed by emplacement the Catface porphyry at 41 - 40 . 4 Ma ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which took place at a time that the slab window was open .
However , although oxidation is crucial to porphyry mineralization , adakites are not systematically more oxidized than normal arc magmas ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; X . M .
Nevertheless , most arc magmas formed at much N 10 % partial melting , resulting in much lower Cu contents ( e . g . , 100 ppm ) , which is not favorable than reducing magmas for porphyry mineralization .
Alternatively , the magma must scavenge laterally for distances over 10 km and concentrates the Cu at one relatively small spot .
This is because the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate during partial melting is essential for the efficient extraction of chalcophile elements out of the source region , especially from subducted oceanic slabs , which have more than 5 times more sulfur than the mantle .
The uniform and low SO 3 contents in apatite from reduced magma deposits were used to argue that the low oxygen fugacity of these porphyries is primary ( Fig . 20 ) ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Here we discuss two reduced porphyry deposits in detail .
Interestingly , the Catface porphyry deposit is closely associated with Mt Washington , which is an adakite ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) and seemingly would support the slab window model .
Given that for most chalcophile elements , the partition coefficient between sulfide and melt is very high , elimination of residual sulfide is essential for the extraction of chalcophile elements from the source and thus the formation of porphyry deposits .

At higher pressure , oxygen fugacity can be controlled by the oxygen buffer technique ( Eugster , 1957 ) and the Shaw membrane ( Shaw , 1963 ) , and measured with the hydrogen fugacity sensor technique ( Chou , 1978 ) .
Because quantitative oxygen barometers based on Fe - Ti oxides are prone to resetting , and primary whole rock Fe ( III ) / Fe ( II ) ratios and anhydrite , if originally present , are unlikely to have survived the hydrothermal alteration and surficial weathering of this deposit , the zircon Ce 4 + / Ce 3 + ratio has been used to indicate its high oxygen fugacity ( Fig . 12 ) ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ) .

Stability domains of trisulfur ion S 3 − at total dissolved sulfur concentrations of 1 wt . % and 0 . 1 wt . % are shown .
It is located in the Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet .
It is estimated that the amount of H + , released during the reduction of sulfate and oxidation of ferrous iron , may lower the pH down to + 2 , depending on temperatures , and if there are no pH buffers in the system to significantly elevate the oxygen fugacity ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) and oxidize magnetite or ferrous Fe in hydrothermal fluids to hematite and / or specularite ( Eq .

Baogutu is hosted in ilmenite - series diorites , containing native antimony ( An and Zhu , 2010 ) , hypogenepyrrhotite , and methane - rich fluid inclusions .
Evidence for reduced magmas of Catface porphyry deposit
The formation of the Catface porphyry deposit
Relationship between Sr and C aside , the amount of C needed is very small .
As discussed above , slab melting is usually involved in creating magmas with high Cu contents and adequately high oxygen fugacity , which are the two main controlling factors for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Section 3 ) .

The key processes of porphyry mineralization are oxidation and reduction of sulfur .
In our opinion , the reduced porphyry deposits so far reported are either host rocks at distal sites as far as several kilometers away from or above the causative porphyry lying deep underneath , or a consequence of fluid transportation .

There are three major porphyry Mo deposit belts in the world , the Henderson - Climax ( Klemm et al . , 2008 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a , b ; Singer , 2008 ) , Qinling - Dabie ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2000 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; Mao et al . , 2008 ; Stein et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ; and Xing ' an - Mongolia belts ( Wu et al . , 2011 ; Y . Zhang et al . , 2013 ; Zeng et al . , 2013 ) .
Experiments show that sulfate is much more soluble than sulfide in magmas .
Such large degrees of partial melting would dilute the released Cu and produce picrite or even komatiite , not basalt .
Nevertheless , normal arc rocks are not favorable materials for porphyry Cu mineralization .
Correspondingly , the Cu contents of such melts would be 450 and 1000 ppm , respectively .
In addition to direct oxidation of magnetite , hematite and specularite may form directly from fluids ( Eq .
More accurately , the ferrous Fe in fluids reacts with water , releasing H 2 and H + ( Eq .
The difference between porphyry and epithermal in terms of oxygen fugacity
We propose that these sulfides formed directly from magmatic fluids .
It may also constitute ore with Cu either in the form of chalcopyrite or as high sulfidation - state assemblages ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .

( 2 ) What is the main sulfur species in porphyry ?
The systematically low oxygen fugacities in Japan arc volcanic rocks ( bΔFMQ + 2 ) compared to those from the western American continents ( up to ΔFMQ + 3 ) ( Fig . 16 ) , is an important factor controlling the distribution of Cu porphyry deposits , i . e . , abundant porphyry Cu deposits are located in the western American continents , whereas none occur in Japan ( Fig . 1 ) ( Sun et al . , 2012b ( Sun et al . , , 2013b .
( 13 ) is simplified , Fe 2 O 3 represents the ferric Fe in Fe 3 O 4 .
Catface is the largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , emplaced at 40 . 4 - 41 Ma , with an indicated reserve of 56 . 9 Mt @ 0 . 4 % Cu and an additional inferred resource of 262 . 4 million tons @ 0 . 38 % Cu .
This implies that such porphyry deposits themselves are not genetically related to reduced magmas , i . e . , they are not the causative magma , but the host rock .
As shown in Fig . 25 , sulfides in phenocrysts are associated with fluid inclusions ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
Therefore , ( 1 ) both eruptive and intrusive rocks can be classified as adakites ; and ( 2 ) adakites may be produced simply by partial melting of mafic rocks in the presence of garnet and absence of plagioclase .

This is likely due to a lowering of the pH as mineralization continues .

Others have argued that SO2 is the main sulfur species dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , not sulfate nor sulﬁde .
As is characteristic of Cenozoic porphyry deposits in southwestern Pacific , it contains no Mo .

The involvement of such reducing agents as organic matter seemingly explains the system ' s lower oxygen fugacity .

In addition to abundant hydrothermal anhydrite of up to 10 % or more , magmatic anhydrite is also reported in unaltered granodiorite porphyry .
Most of the ore forming adakites were formed through slab melting ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a , deriving from the subducting oceanic crust itself rather than the overlying mantle wedge .
It has been argued that slab melts might be unusually oxidized and rich in sulfur , due to high Fe 3 + content from oxidative sea - floor alteration .

Otherwise , there is no ferrous Fe in the system .
Linkage between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits
The relationship between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits during these three steps are discussed below .
They are associated with carbonic - rich ore forming fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , and multiple intrusive events ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
More interestingly , the Catface intrusions have fO 2 values nearly identical to the C - CO - CO 2 buffer at similar pressure and temperature conditions ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , which would support the assimilation of graphite - rich sediments .
Therefore , more work on porphyry dykes are needed to clarify the origin of the Baogutu porphyry deposit .
The consensus is that the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is systematically higher than that of MORB ( Fig . 16 ) ( Carmichael , 1991 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013a .
In contrast to most other rock types , adakite is defined by geochemical compositions ( e . g . , SiO 2 ≥ 56 wt . % , Al 2 O 3 ≥ 15 wt . % , Y ≤ 18 ppm , Yb ≤ 1 . 9 ppm and Sr ≥ 400 ppm ) without detailed petrographic constraints .
The question is again why normal arc rocks in compressed environments do not form porphyry deposits .
It has been proposed that partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust forms adakites with systematically higher Cu initial contents - favorable for porphyry Cu mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2012a .
It has been proposed that oxygen fugacity of log fO2 N FMQ + 2 ( i . e . , ΔFMQ + 2 , where FMQ is the fayalite–magnetite– quartz oxygen buffer ) is the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
The best examples are the Cenozoic porphyry Cu and Au deposits occurring in the southwestern Pacific islands , and to a less extent , the Paleozoic porphyry Cu - Au deposits in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt .

No significant amounts of methane have been detected in most cases , except in reduced porphyries ( see details in Section 4 ) .
It has been proposed that H 2 O reacts with FeO , forming Fe 2 O 3 with the release of H 2 ( Eq .
It is very likely that the preferential enrichments of Cu and Au over Ni and Pt are controlled by sulfide complexes in fluid .

What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity range for porphyry mineralization ?
Some workers proposed that ΔFMQ + 2 is a magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ) , whereas ΔFMQ + 2 to + 4 is the most favorable range of oxygen fugacity for porphyry deposits ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Some workers proposed that sulfide undersaturation is important for porphyry mineralization , i . e . , no residual sulfide remains in the source ( Li et al . , 2012b ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , whereas others argued that sulfide saturation and accumulation are of critical importance for porphyry mineralization ( Wilkinson , 2013 ) .
This is one reason why the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magma did not change much ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , or even decrease slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( see also Section 5 ) .
This in turn increases the pH and promotes magnetite formation ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , which may explain magnetite and hematite intergrowths ( Fig . 10 ) .
The authors used published heavy H values from circum - Pacific volcanic gases ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) to argue that degassing should leave behind fluids with even lighter H than contained in the magmatic and metamorphic fluids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This seemingly implies that porphyry and epithermal deposits are closely related .
More than half of the world porphyry Cu deposits are located along the western coasts of the North and South American continents comprising the eastern Pacific margin .

One common indicator of the high oxygen fugacity of porphyry deposits is sulfate , i . e . , both magmatic and hydrothermal sulfate , e . g . , hydrothermal anhydrite and magmatic anhydrite and gypsum are abundant in essentially all large porphyry deposits ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Halter et al . , 2005 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ; Kavalieris et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2008 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; .

It consists of 12 Oligocene rhyolitic stocks in three centers , Henderson ( oldest ) , Seriate , and Vasquez ( deepest and youngest ) , at depths of ~ 1 km below the surface at the Red Mountain ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) , with a reserve of 1 . 24 Mt Mo @ 0 . 17 wt . % ( Table 1 ) .
It is even argued that some porphyry deposits formed in reduced magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Some workers concluded that sulfate is the predominant sulfur species in ore - forming porphyries ( Cooke et al . , 2011 ; Field et al . , 2005 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sotnikov et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) , whereas others argue that the main sulfur species is SO 2 dissolved in porphyry magmas ( Richards , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . , neither sulfate nor sulfide .
In order to form supergiant porphyry deposits , e . g . , El Teniente , up to 600 km 3 of magma with a Cu content of 100 ppm would be needed to get the necessary amount of metal ( Stern et al . , 2011 ) .
Among them are degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .
( 28 ) ) , assuming all the Fe in the parental Catface magmas was ferric Fe , and all the ferric Fe was reduced by graphite , then only 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 wt . % of graphite is required , which may only have had a limited influence on Sr isotopes .

Based on previously obtained fluid inclusion H - O isotope data and sulfide S - Pb isotope data , it was proposed that the methane - rich ore forming fluids in the Baogutu porphyry deposit were derived from a deep mantle source with little contamination from sedimentary components ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .

As discussed in Section 3 , oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 are of critical importance to eliminate residual sulfides during slab melting .
It is noteworthy that these deposits are associated with the closure of backarc basins younger than 25 Ma ( Fig . 29 ) .

It is also associated with a highly oxidized magma , as indicated by anhydrite veinlets and a magnetite - titanohematite assemblage , which indicates oxygen fugacities near the HM buffer at nearly magmatic temperature ( Imai , 2001 ) .

It has also been argued that iron oxides - copper - gold ( known as IOCG ) deposits are the low S version of porphyry Cu - Au deposits , controlled by secular changes in oceanic sulfate content and the geothermal gradients at the end of the Precambrian ( Richards and Mumin , 2013 ) .

Therefore , the behaviors of Cu and Au are strongly controlled by sulfide , whereas Mo is much less sensitive to sulfide , especially at high oxygen fugacities .
( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate the oxidation potential of sulfate .

( 22 ) , ( 23 ) ) also would lower the pH of the fluids , which in turn would elevate oxidation potential of sulfate .
The systematic difference in oxygen fugacities is likely not primary .
Instead , it is controlled by ferrous Fe , which is more stable under high pressure .
Recent experiments show that water and H 2 can coexist as two immiscible phases .
This can be interpreted as a magmatic process , i . e . , the magnetite crystallization and sulfate reduction recorded in glasses occurred during magma evolution .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high Cu , S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
Such elevated contents in the magma , of course , are consistent with the high S contents present in ore bearing porphyries .
The other way to regulate the oxygen fugacity of sample assemblages is to control the hydrogen fugacity using the Shaw membrane , which introduces variable amount of hydrogen gas into the system ( Shaw , 1963 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The close association between highly oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits may best be illustrated by a FeO versus fO 2 diagram ( Fig . 9 ) .
The predicted SCSS content at sulfide saturation in basalts ranges from 1300 ppm at ΔFMQ − 1 and 1500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 0 . 5 , to 7500 ppm at ΔFMQ + 2 and 1 . 4 wt . % at ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ( Fig . 15 ) ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
This argument is based on the low S content in the rock ' s apatite and a recent work by Kelley and Cottrell ( 2012 ) , which proposed that fractional crystallization coupled with degassing of S in a sub volcanic arc magma chamber can result in a reduction of N 2 log fO 2 units in the magma .
It has also been proposed that slab melts are the most efficient way to transfer high Fe 3 + / Fe 2 + ratios responsible for high oxygen fugacity in adakites ( Mungall , 2002 ) and arc magmas ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) .
Consistently , it becomes more oxidizing with decreasing depths and pressures ( Stagno and Frost , 2010 ; Stagno et al . , 2013 ) .
In addition , assimilation of oxidizing country rocks ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , degassing of reduced volatile species ( e . g . , H 2 , H 2 S and CH 4 ) ( Ballhaus , 1993 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ) and lowering of pH values in a sulfate - sulfide dominated system ( Sun et al . , 2013a , b ) may also elevate the oxygen fugacity of the magmas .

This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential of sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
This , in turn , elevates the oxidation potential sulfate , driving the oxygen fugacities up to the HM buffer .
In special cases , some of the reduced gases may escape from the system , and even get trapped in fluid inclusions .
Given that a large portion of metals in a porphyry deposit are hosted in wall rocks , attention is needed to identify the causative porphyries .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It also has been proposed that porphyry Mo deposits have systematically lower oxygen fugacities than porphyry Cu ( Au ) and Cu - Mo deposits ( Fig . 9 ) .
It has long been proposed that oxygen fugacities higher than ΔFMQ + 2 have reached the magic number for porphyry mineralization ( Mungall , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , the final stage of mineralization inevitably requires the reduction of sulfate ( S ) ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) ) , which drives up the oxidation potential of sulfate .
Therefore , the key process of porphyry mineralization is oxidation and reduction of sulfur , controlled by ferrous / ferric Fe and pH values .
In contrast , why are there no porphyry deposits in Japan , where the ilmenite - series is well - developed ( Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ) ?
More importantly , compared to oxidized magmas , reduced magmas indeed have lower sulfur contents with S 2− occurring as the dominant sulfur species ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) , but this does not necessarily mean higher S 2− in reduced magmas as claimed by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) .
There are indeed several small porphyry deposits that appear to be related to reduced porphyries .
This is probably true along the western margin of the North American continent and other places where reduced sediments are well developed ( see more in Section 4 ) .

Some experiments suggest that D Mo increases with decreasing oxygen fugacities ( Li and Audetat , 2013 ) .
In contrast , unrealistic N50 % partial melting is needed to eliminate all residual sulfides at oxygen fugacities lower than ΔFMQ + 1 , corresponding to a Cu content of less than 200 ppm in the melt .
Previous studies suggested that assimilation occurring during the emplacement of porphyries resulted in reduction , which is mainly focused along the porphyry - country rock interface ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) .
This was used to argue that the sulfide phase is crystalline rather than an immiscible sulfide melt .

From this one could surmise that porphyry Cu - Au deposits are associated with island arcs , whereas porphyry Cu - Mo deposits are associated with continental arcs .
Such conditions will promote the formation of hematite and would be favorable for porphyry mineralization .

We find such small differences in Sr isotopes to be negligible , and thus do not argue strongly against the assimilation model .
This may explain why there is no Ni and Pt in most porphyry and epithermal deposits .
Water : It has been proposed that slab melts might be unusually water rich ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .
The consensus is that most of the porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au systems are initiated by injection of oxidized adakitic magma saturated with aqueous ﬂuids that are S - and metal - rich , i . e . , the parental magmas must be water rich and oxidized ( e . g . , Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Garrido et al . , 2002 ; Imai , 2002 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Stern et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
For example , there are also many porphyry Cu - Au deposits ( without economic levels of Mo ) in the western American continents , including some of the world ' s top 25 largest porphyry deposits , e . g . , Cerro Casale in Chile ; Minas Conga in Peru ; Bajo de la Alumbrera in Argentina ; Pebble Copper in the USA ; and Prosperity in Canada .
Previous studies suggested that a slab window introduces hot , upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment , forming non - arc - like alkalic and adakitic magmatism in the volcanic arc ( Abratis and Worner , 2001 ; Groome and Thorkelson , 2009 ; H . Li et al . , 2011H .

More importantly , there are three intrusive phases at Baogutu , which from old to young are : ( 1 ) the main diorite phase , ( 2 ) dikes of diorite porphyry and granodiorite porphyry intruding the early diorite stock , and ( 3 ) dikes of hornblende diorite porphyry intruding all the three phases .
This can best be explained by the reduction of Re 6 + to Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .

This can best be explained by the reduction Re 4 + during magnetite crystallization .
It has been further proposed that adakites might more readily crystallize as intrusive plutons because of their viscous felsic nature , leading to the generation of a more efficient crustal magmatic - hydrothermal systems ( Sajona and Maury , 1998 ) .

As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S at sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
As shown in Fig . 16 , the highest oxygen fugacity in arc magmas may be NΔFMQ + 3 , which allows up to 1 . 4 wt . % of S sulfide saturation ( Jugo , 2009 ) .
However , it would result in early sulfide saturation and segregation from the melt .
The authors then proposed that the reduced Catface porphyry was due to degassing of SO 2 from the magma .
They also argued that significantly lower sulfur solubility in reduced melt ( Jugo , 2009 ; Jugo et al . , 2005Jugo et al . , , 2010 keeps S 2− as the dominant sulfur species , which potentially isolates sulfides from the magma during its migration to the site of final emplacement , thus producing only relatively small chalcophile endowments ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This is probably mainly because the crust in backarc basins is too thin .
Twenty out of the world ' s top 25 giant porphyry Cu deposits are located there .
The question then becomes that most arc plutons are water saturated and highly oxidized , why do only a very small fraction of special magmas ( mostly adakitic characterized by high Sr / Y and high Sr ) in arc settings form porphyry deposits .

It has long been proposed that most porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Burnham and Ohmoto , 1980 ; Candela , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Liang et al . , 2006 ; Liang et al . , 2009 ; Mungall , 2002 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2012aSun et al . , , 2013b , also known as the magnetite - series magmas ( Ishihara and Terashima , 1989 ) ( Fig . 9 ) .
The euhedral characteristics of the hematite imply a hydrothermal origin .
Although most geologists agree that porphyry deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas ( Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , it is still hotly debated as regarding to why oxidized magmas favor porphyry mineralization and how oxidized the oreforming magmas should be .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state of the silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
Elements that can exist in variable oxidation states and that are present in sufficient abundances to affect the redox state silicate Earth are C , H , S , and Fe ( Mungall , 2002 ) .
As mentioned previously , primitive hematite - magnetite intergrowths have been reported in many porphyry Cu deposits all over the world ( Fig . 10 ) , including nearly all major porphyry deposits in China ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) , as well as some deposits in South America ( Ballard et al . , 2002 ; Patricio and Gonzalo , 2001 ; and the Southwest Pacific islands ( Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Imai et al . , 2007 ) , and Mongolia ( Khashgerel et al . , 2008 ) .
This suggests that , in contrast to hydrothermal systems in the Manus backarc basin Sun et al . , 2004a ) , the oxygen fugacity of porphyries increases during magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

The addition of subduction released oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to arc magmas is proposed as the most straightforward way , e . g . , water ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ) , oxidizing fluids and / or melts ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ) , fluids with oxidizing components , e . g . , hematite , sulfate ( X . M .
As mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . 2 , magnetite crystallization in magmas reduces sulfate without changing the pH values .
( 20 ) , ( 21 ) ) or escape from the porphyry system during degassing or diffusive loss ( Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
The third mechanism proposed for the reduced condition of the Catface porphyry was by assimilation of reduced sediments .
This mechanism was excluded based on Sr isotopes ( see details below ) ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
Baogutu is located in West Junggar , Central Asian Orogenic Belt , and is the second largest reduced porphyry Cu deposit so far reported , with controlled reserves of 0 . 63 Mt Cu @ 0 . 28 wt . % , 14 t Au @ 0 . 1 ppm , 1 . 8 × 10 4 t Mo @ 0 . 011 wt . % and 390 t Ag @ 1 . 8 ppm ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
As pointed out by previous authors , porphyry deposits associated with reduced magmas are generally small ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This was attributed to the originally low Cu and Au contents of the magmas , less magmatic fluids released due to deep emplacement , or tectonic settings that are not favorable for porphyry mineralization ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
In addition to the transportation of Cu and Au from the causal porphyry to distal sites of deposition ( Rowins , 2000 ) , we propose two other ways that may form reduced porphyry deposits : ( 1 ) by reduction of oxidized magmas during their ascent in the crust , and ( 2 ) by using reduced magmatic rocks that are present only as country rocks to host ore deposits originating from underlying oxidized magmas .
As shown in Fig . 26 , in contrast to Cu and Au ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) and also V , Co , Pt , and Se , Re concentrations in Manus glasses keep increasing when magnetite starts to crystallize , and then decrease gradually ( Sun et al . , 2003a ) .
Previous studies suggested that these magmas are a product of continental arc - style magmatism ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
For example , 10 % partial melting of MORB with a S content of 1000 ppm at ΔFMQ N 2 . 3 , would form a melt with a S content of ~ 1 wt . % , which is only half of its SCSS .
This is supported by the abundance of oxidized components , e . g .
In contrast , there are essentially no porphyry Cu deposits located along the northwestern Pacific margin , e . g . , Japan .
( 5 ) What are the connections between porphyry deposits and reduced magmas , if there is any ?
Some researchers have even argued that Cu comes from the mantle , whereas Mo comes from the continental crust ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) .
In addition to those mentioned above , hematite flakes in quartz veinlets have been reported in the Waisoi porphyry Cu deposit ( Namosi district ) , Viti Levu , Fiji ( Imai et al . , 2007 ) .

Only four times greater enrichments of Cu are needed to reach economic porphyry deposit proportions of ~ 4000 ppm .

Previous studies proposed that , in the Henderson porphyry Mo deposit , Fe was leached at high to moderately high temperatures and then fixed in the rock at lower temperatures , first mainly as magnetite and then as pyrite and minor pyrrhotite and specular hematite ( Seedorff and Einaudi , 2004a ) .
Interestingly , in addition to abundant magnetite in porphyry deposits ( Astudillo et ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
The small difference between the average MORB and experimental values is likely due to slight differences in oxygen fugacities and pressure effects , i . e . , sulfide is less soluble under higher pressures ( Mavrogenes and O ' Neill , 1999 ) .
This ought to be easily achieved through magma evolution plus hydrothermal processes .
Experiments with apatite have shown that SO 3 contents reflect the oxygen fugacity of the magmas ( Peng et al . , 1997 ) .
As mentioned in Section 3 , a variety of mechanisms have been proposed .
In contrast to the dramatically elevated oxygen fugacities during magnetite crisis , the oxygen fugacity of the Manus magmas did not change much , or even lessened slightly during the crystallization of magnetite and sulfate reduction ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .

This is not the case , however , although porphyry Cu ( ± Au and ± Mo ) deposits indeed do have higher ε Nd isotopic values ( Hou et al . , 2007a ) , implying less contribution from the continental crust .

Reference lines and boxes are as follow : meteoric water line ( Craig , 1961 ) , felsic magmatic water ( Taylor , 1992 ) , residual water in intrusion after degassing and crystallization ( Taylor , 1974 ) , low - salinity vapor discharges from high - temperature volcanic fumaroles ( Giggenbach , 1992b ) , primary magmatic water area , metamorphic water area and multiple formation water area ( Hoefs , 2004 ) .
A similar model has been proposed based on geochemical and mineralogical studies by Shen and Pan ( 2013 ) , in which mineral composition data suggest that the primary magma of the Baogutu porphyry deposit is oxidized .
Careful studies are needed to identify the causative porphyries .
This may equally explain the diversity in oxygen fugacities at convergent margins .
Therefore , it does not require very high oxygen fugacities to eliminate residual sulfides .
The deposit consists of a cluster of three porphyries , with Tongchang as the largest in the center , Fujiawu the second in the southeast and Zhushahong , a small deposit in the northwest ; X . F .
It is not clear whether the portion of the subducting slab underneath Qulong was continental or oceanic .

( 26 ) ) , which is compensated by further reduction S 3 − ( Eq .
This calculated reduction was based on the rock ' s ferric iron content and S in melt inclusions , and would hold true for magmas varying in composition from basaltic andesite to dacite ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
As discussed above ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , assimilation of reduced sediments may have reduced the oxygen fugacity of the Catface porphyry , a possibility that was excluded based on Sr isotopes .
We propose that the reduced features of the Baogutu porphyry deposit are secondary and occurred during emplacement , thus having no major influence on the mineralization process .
None of these scenarios are practical . For adakitic melts with initial Cu contents of ~ 1000 ppm , the amount of magma needed measures only 60 km 3 for the supergiant El Teniente .
It has also been proposed that degassing of SO 2 may lower the oxygen fugacity ( Kelley and Cottrell , 2012 ) .
More importantly , they are associated with ilmenite - bearing , reduced I - type granitoids ( Cao et al . , 2014 ; Rowins , 2000 ) , in direct contrast to oxidized porphyries that are related to a magnetite - series mineralogy ( Ishihara and Sasaki , 1991 ; Thompson et al . , 1999 ) .

The most straightforward way to elevate the oxygen fugacity of arc magmas is by the addition of oxidizing components to the mantle wedge or directly to the magmas .

In summary , essentially , most if not all , porphyry Cu - Au deposits are highly oxidized ( Figs . 9 , 10 ) .

The geodynamic and architectural controls on porphyry formation in this complex tectonic zone are unclear ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) .
They were attributed to either the attempted subduction of the Arabian plate beneath the Eurasian plate , or the change from subduction of oceanic to continental crust ( Cooke et al . , 2005 ) , or partial melting of a fertile copper - and sulfur - enriched arc crustal keel ( Haschke et al . , 2010 ) .

Therefore , none of the arguments concerning water abundance can be plausibly interpreted to explain an association between adakites and porphyry deposits .
Similar to El Teniente , the formation of the Chuquicamata porphyry Cu deposits also lasted for several million years , between 36 and 31 Ma ( Ballard et al . , 2001 ; Ossandon et al . , 2001 ) .
It is closely associated with highly oxidized adakite ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .
Some major questions to be answered are : How reduced magmas formed in an arc environment , where oxidized magmas are common , e . g . , in western North America ?
This was interpreted as the main evidence for degassing ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) .
This decoupling may partially explain why most arc magmas are highly oxidized , whereas only a small portion of them form porphyry Cu deposits .
This conclusion was drawn based mainly on the behavior of Se , which was assumed as a proxy that follows S closely during magmatic evolution except that it is not lost during low - pressure ( near sea - floor ) degassing .

This is seemingly consistent with the moderate incompatibility of Cu during mantle magmatism ( Sun et al . , 2003a , b ) , which leads to Cu depletion in the mantle wedge .

Further studies are needed on the formation of Sar - Cheshmeh and other Cenozoic porphyry deposits in the belt .
Nevertheless , in places with thick sections of reducing sediments , e . g . , the western North America , sulfide saturation and segregation may occur during evolution of the magma , forming Cu - rich cumulates at the base of plutons .
During a period of recharge by mantle - derived mafic magmas into the base of the chamber and associated volatile transfer and concentration near its roof , the opportunity arose to produce the Cu - and S - rich magmas that formed the anhydrite - bearing intrusive rocks ( Stern et al . , 2007 ) .
They would become enriched at an early stage of magma evolution , and dissolve into fluids following reduction accompanying magnetite crystallization ( Sun et al . , 2004a ( Sun et al . , , 2013b , or other reduction processes .
Lines E1 , E2 , E3 and E4 , show trajectories for sulfur reduction ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .

In principle , there are several ways to lower the oxygen fugacities during magma evolution .
As discussed previously ( Section 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the magnetite crystallization reduces the oxygen fugacity only in magmatic systems ( reactions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) ) , and may only lower the oxygen fugacity to the FMQ oxygen buffer .

Intergrowths of magnetite and hematite indicate that oxygen fugacities of porphyry deposits often reach the values defined by the HM buffer ( Fig . 10 ) .

This kind of reduction process has been reported for Baogutu ( Shen and Pan , 2013 ) , which was classified as a reduced porphyry Cu deposit associated with ilmenite - series magmas ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) ( see detailed discussion in Section 4 . 3 ) .
Such an environment should be favorable for trapping magma in a non - erupting , closed - system pluton where sulfur might precipitate as hydrothermal sulfides and sulfates instead of being degassed as SO 2 ( Oyarzun et al . , , 2002 .

It is , however , not likely to be a major process in plutons , which should experience much less degassing .
Experiments find that the main transporting agents of Cu at the porphyry level are brines and that models based on transporting copper in the vapor phase are incorrect ( Lerchbaumer and Audetat , 2012 ) .
In fact , as shown in the supplementary information , sulfide is undersaturated in Manus glasses ( Fig . 24 ) ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are driven to the right , promoting sulfate reduction .
This plausibly explains the common association between high - Mg adakites and porphyry Cu deposits .
( 29 ) ) , such that only ~ 0 . 02 to 0 . 05 wt . % of methane is needed .
As discussed above , this is exactly the point at which residual sulfide is eliminated by ~ 10 % partial melting of a subducted slab , forming melts with initial Cu contents up to 1000 ppm .
Three potential mechanisms for the formation of Catface reducing magmas had been discussed before degassing was assigned as the causative process : ( 1 ) upwelling of the reducing asthenospheric mantle induced by the opening of a slab window during ridge subduction , ( 2 ) evolvement of subducted reducing sediments , and ( 3 ) assimilation of reduced sediments during magma emplacement ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .

These papers , however , did not consider the effects of oxygen fugacity and dramatically underestimated the contributions of slab melting .
It is commonly located in the immediate wallrocks of the porphyry intrusion , or are found as a centrally located zone of some porphyry Cu stocks ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
It is , however , still controversial as regards to : why high oxygen fugacity is favorable for the mineralization of porphyry deposits , how oxidized the magma could be , whether adakitic magma is essential for porphyry mineralization or whether the porphyry deposits can be associated with normal arc rocks ( Fig . 2 ) , and why the pure porphyry Mo deposits are also closely associated with highly oxidized magmas .

As summarized recently ( Sun et al . , 2014b ) , the main alteration reactions are Eqs .
One of the most important geologic processes that enriches Mo is the oxidation - reduction cycle operating during chemical weathering at the Earth ' s surface , i . e . , Mo is mobilized during oxidation and then enriched in organic - rich sediments due to reduction ( Li et al . , 2012a , b ) .
Three criteria have been proposed for the classification of reduced porphyry Cu deposits : ( 1 ) lack of primary hematite and sulfate minerals , ( 2 ) rich in hypogene pyrrhotite and CH 4 , and ( 3 ) oxides belongs to the ilmenite - series , reduced , I - type granitoids ( Rowins , 2000 ) .
Nevertheless , it is still hotly debated as regards to how arc magmas get oxidized .
Degassing , however , is not likely to be a main process in porphyry mineralization that occurs at 2 - 4 km depths in the upper crust .
There are also several mechanisms that , in principle , may lower the oxygen fugacity of magmas : ( 1 ) Addition of reducing sediments from plate subduction ( Takagi , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) Assimilation of reducing country rocks ( Ishihara and Matsuhisa , 1999 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) ; ( 3 ) Degassing of oxidized volatile species ( i . e .

Given that it formed at 14 Ma , which post - date the initial collision between Indian and Eurasian continents , Qulong is taken as a typical post - collisional porphyry deposit .

Major disagreements include : ( 1 ) What is the most favorable oxygen fugacity for porphyry mineralization ?
It is further demonstrated , using experimental studies , that brine - vapor separation in porphyry deposits does not cause selective Cu transfer to the vapor , but is more likely to destabilize Cu complexes and promote copper ore deposition during decompression and unmixing of the two fluid phases .
It may be subdivided into two different types - a less common , early greenish to greenish - gray in color alteration , and a far more common white alteration .

CH 4 þ 4Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 8FeO þ CO 2 þ 2H 2 Oð29Þ Considering that the Catface porphyry is not adakitic , it may well be simply the country rock that hosts the deposit .
All the samples with the exception of two were collected from the diorite , which are not porphyry at all .
Sulfur is one of the most important geosolvents that controls the behaviors of copper and other chalcophile elements , therefore knowledge of its geochemical behavior is essential to the understanding of mineralization processes for copper and a variety of other metal resources .

For these reasons , we find it not surprising that no economically viable porphyry deposits associated with volcanic arcs are known in the northwestern Pacific region .
The main questions discussed in this section include that : whether oxygen fugacity is a controlling factor that dictates the distribution of porphyry deposits .

It is also an important re - source of Au , Ag , Zn , Sn and W . Most porphyry deposits are found above active subduction zones ( Fig . 1 ) ( e . g . , Chiaradia , 2014 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2012 ; Gonzalez - Partida et al . , 2003 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1998 ; Kesler , 1997 ; Lee , 2014 ; Richards , 1999 , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) , with a few occurrences at post - collisional or other tectonic settings ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) , e . g . , porphyry Mo deposits in the east - ern Qinling orogenic belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2012a ; N . Li et al . , 2013 ) and , arguably porphyry Cu–Mo deposits in Gangdese belt on the south Tibetan Plateau ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ; Xiao et al . , 2012 ) and some porphyry Cu deposits in Iran ( Calagari , 2003 ; Castillo , 2006 ; Haschke et al . , 2010 ; Shaﬁei et al . , 2009 ) .
The orange field between HM and ΔFMQ + 2 is the optimum condition for porphyry Cu , Au , Mo mineralization ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
This melt then would have the capacity to assimilate large amounts of sulfide .
C þ 2Fe 2 O 3 ¼ 4FeO þ CO 2ð28Þ Reduced sediments usually also contain methane ( Cao et al . , 2014 ) , which is a more efficient reductant , i . e . , 1 methane molecule reduces 8 ferric Fe atoms ( Eq .
Based on the above discussion , we propose the following model for the formation of the Catface porphyry .
Major controversies to be discussed here are : ( 1 ) Why do most of the porphyry deposits associated with oxidized magmas occur at convergent margins ?
Potassic alteration is located in the center and deeper portions of the porphyry .
The problem with this model is that no studies have ever demonstrated that adakites are more hydrous than normal arc rocks .
Previous studies , however , did not quantitatively model the influence of oxygen fugacity , although its positive effect has been emphasized ( Sun et al . , 2011 ( Sun et al . , , 2013a .
The distribution of porphyry deposits does not support the premise that the Cu comes from the mantle .
Based on high pressure experiments , it was proposed that the trisulfur ion S 3 − is an important sulfur species ( Fig . 11 ) at pressures and temperatures ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) that are common for porphyry systems ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ; Seo et al . , 2009 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2014a , b ) .
It has been further proposed that in general geological processes where the tri - sulfur ion may have been involved need to be reconsidered ( Pokrovski and Dubrovinsky , 2011 ) , and this would require the investigation of different reaction pathways ( Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
( 15 ) , ( 16 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 25 ) ) together with alkali contents in the porphyry together control advanced argillic lithocap formation and alteration ( Sillitoe , 2010 ) .
Yet others claimed that variations in oxidation state over typical ranges for arc magmas formed during plate subduction ( ΔFMQ = 0 to + 2 ) have no major effects on the potential to form porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits during plate subduction ( Richards , 2011b ) .
It is located in the western Dabie Mountains , along the east extension of the East Qinling Mo mineralization belt ( Chen , 2013 ; Chen et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2010 ; H . Y .
As shown in Fig . 6 , the pressure dependence of log fO 2 is quite small , while log fH 2 increases rapidly at low pressures but less at higher pressures .

This was attributed to sulfate buffering ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , i . e . , the oxidation of ferrous iron is coupled with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide ( Eqs .

This process , however , was excluded from further consideration based on the low 87 Sr / 86 Sr of Catface ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) .
As argued below ( Section 3 . 2 . 1 ) , a strong case can be made that most of the Cu comes from subducted oceanic crust .

Dilles et al . , 2011 ; Imai , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2002 ) , hematite and specularite ( a hydrothermal variety of hematite ) are common in porphyry copper deposits ( Figs . 10 , 13 ) ( Zhang , Ling et al . , 2013 ; Sillitoe , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) .
Therefore , subduction of reducing sediments is not a plausible explanation for the low fO 2 shown by the Catface porphyry .
Nevertheless , it became wetter and even more reduced ( ΔFMQ − 0 . 3 to − 3 ) with a higher Cu content after assimilating the Cu - rich sulfide accumulations in the lower crust .

It is located in southwestern Iran and is associated with several intrusive pulses of Miocene stocks ( ~ 12 . 2 Ma ) ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) , ranging in composition from diorite through granodiorite to quartzmonzonite ( Hezarkhani , 2006 ) .
Sulfate ( SO 4 2− ) is over 10 times more soluble than sulfide ( S 2− ) , and thus the solubility of sulfur depends strongly on sulfur speciation , which in turn depends on oxygen fugacities .
As discussed above ( Section 4 . 1 . 2 , Fig . 21 ) , the authors ' understanding about H - O isotopes is in error , whereas only small amount of C is enough to lower the oxygen fugacity of the Baogutu low Fe magmas .
As pointed out by the authors , detailed studies are needed to clarify the origin of the CH 4 .
Based on a synthesis of theoretical , experimental , and field data , it has been proposed that Cu and Au can be transported via the vapor phase to distal sites as far as several kilometers away from the causative porphyry due to fluid boiling or immiscible phase separation .

Because of these uncertainties , it has been asserted that there is no single , obvious reason why slab melts have an unusually high potential to form porphyry deposits ( Richards , 2013 ) .
Second , there is no systematic difference in terms of emplacement depths and tectonic settings between reduced and oxidized porphyry deposits .
This observation , however , does not necessarily support a mantle origin for Cu , either , because both the depleted mantle and the oceanic crust have high ε Nd values , whereas enriched mantle and the continental crust have low ε Nd values .

The total resources there are estimated to be N1 . 8 billion tons , accounting for about 60 % of the world ' s total Cu resource estimation ( Mutschler et al . , 2010 ) .

Their contribution depends heavily on subsequent oxidation , i . e . , a major contribution can be expected only when the sulfide cumulates are oxidized to sulfate , liberating the chalcophile elements .
In this section , we review the oxygen fugacities of a number of famous deposits and then discuss the genetic connections between oxidized magmas and porphyry deposits .

Still other authors have argued that , instead of high oxidation , sul - ﬁde saturation of the magma and consequent pre - enrichment through sulﬁde accumulation are the most important step for porphyry ore de - posits ( Chiaradia , 2014 ; Lee , 2014 ; Wilkinson , 2013 ) .

Nevertheless , the oxygen fugacity undoubtedly fluctuated during porphyry mineralization ( Liang et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2013b ) , and the hydrothermal rutile only records the oxygen fugacities under which it crystallized .
Although using the same set of samples ( Jenner et al . , 2012 ) , and essentially repeating the results of the previous study ( Sun et al . , 2004a ) , it was proposed that magnetite fractionation triggers sulfide saturation .

Consistently , the Mo / Cu ratios of these deposits are generally more than 20 times higher than the primitive mantle ratio value ( McDonough and Sun , 1995 ) , suggesting that Mo has been added to the porphyry deposits from different sources .

Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .

Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Porphyry Cu ore formation
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive δ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .

The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .

The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .

Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .

argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .

Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .

Much of this sedimentary material will be scraped off at the trench to form an accretionary prism , but varying amounts may also be subducted , depending on the degree of coupling between the upper and lower plates , and also the sediment input load ( Fig . 1 ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .
In contrast , deep crustal amphibolites are preserved in the lithosphere , and will be susceptible to partial melting at any later time due to thermal rebound or reheating by invading asthenospheric melts .

Nevertheless , mantle - derived magmas may have a role to play as a heat source for anatexis and possibly as a source of volatiles and metals .
In addition to subduction - related calc - alkaline magmas , a diverse suite of calc - alkaline to alkaline magmas is generated in postsubduction and collisional tectonic settings , and these magmatic systems may also generate porphyry and epithermal ore deposits .

The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .
The now - dense , volatile - depleted magma forms a downward return flow to complete the convective cycle .

Thermal rebound in thickened orogenic crust , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere , or post - collisional rifting ( with ingress of asthenospheric melts into the lower crust in the last two cases ) can all cause small - volume partial melting of arc - metasomatized lithosphere and / or hydrous lower crustal cumulates ( Fig . 4 ; Brown , 2010 ; Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .

When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( Audétat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the Roşia Montană epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .

As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu ± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 °C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425° - 320 °C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .

Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .

Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .

These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3× ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .

( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .

Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

The range of required magma volumes reflects variables such as the depth of magma emplacement and the compatibility of Cu with fractionating mineral phases ( larger volumes are required if Cu is compatible with early fractionating silicate , oxide , or sulfide minerals ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .

Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400° - 500 °C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

Moreover , Blevin and Chappell ( 1992 ) and Blevin et al . ( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .

Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400° - 350 °C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 °C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .

In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .

Partial melting of the subducted oceanic crust and / or sediments may occur under some restricted conditions , but is unlikely to be a widespread process ( in Phanerozoic arcs ) , and does not significantly differ metallogenically from slab - dehydration processes .

Magma generation in convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Magma generation convergent and collided margins : geochemical characteristics and partitioning of metals
Most magmas erupted through or emplaced within the Earth ' s crust are not primary magmas ( in the sense of being chemically unmodified since extraction from their source ) , and most are not even primitive ( in the sense of being relatively unevolved ; Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Leeman , 1983 ; Neuendorf et al . , 2005 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ) .

Magmas erupted through mature continental crust are the most difficult to fingerprint uniquely in terms of source characteristics because wallrock assimilation and fractional crystallization ( AFC ; DePaolo , 1981 ) are ubiquitous and commonly extensive processes that will significantly modify bulk rock geochemical and isotopic compositions ; and yet , these are also the magmas that are most commonly associated with porphyry - and epithermal - type mineral deposits .

Slab dehydration and asthenospheric melting in subduction zones
Water and other volatile components and solutes ( including S and Cl ) were originally incorporated into oceanic crustal and upper mantle rocks during oxidizing seafloor alteration , generating hydrous minerals such as serpentine , talc , amphibole , micas , chlorite , zoisite , chloritoid , and lawsonite .
Slab - derived fluids are thought to be water - rich at these depths , and to carry significant amounts of other volatile components such as Cl and S . For example , salinities in the range of 4 - 10 wt . % NaCl have been inferred from primitive basalt or melt inclusion studies ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Kent et al . , 2002 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) , and salinities of 0 . 4 - 2 wt . % NaCl equivalent were measured in fluid inclusions from high - pressure rocks thought to represent subducted oceanic mantle ( Scambelluri et al . , 2004 ) .
Silica may also be significantly mobilized in these slab fluids ( Aerts et al . , 2010 ; Manning , 2004 ) , as well as Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Arc magmas derived from these sources therefore show characteristic negative anomalies for these three elements on mantle - normalized spider diagrams , but display enrichments in most other incompatible elements ( Foley et al . , 2000 ; Gill , 1981 ; Klemme et al . , 2005 ; Ryerson and Watson , 1987 ; Schmidt et al . , 2004 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) .
Hydrous metasomatism of the mid - ocean - ridge basalt ( MORB ) depleted asthenospheric mantle wedge causes partial melting by lowering the solidus of peridotite ( Arculus , 1994 ; Kushiro et al . , 1968 ; Stolper and Newman , 1994 ) .
Partial melting of hydrated peridotite under these conditions in the mantle wedge generates high - Mg basalts ( Greene et al . , 2006 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) .
Arc basalts are also characterized by distinctly higher oxidation states than MORB ( up to 2 log units above the fayalite - magnetitequartz buffer : ΔFMQ + 2 ; Ballhaus , 1993 ; Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Parkinson and Arculus , 1999 ; Rowe et al . , 2009 ) .
Gold and PGE partition strongly into sulfide phases relative to silicate melts , but Cu to a somewhat lesser degree ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) , so if sulfides are abundant in the magma source region , partial melts will be depleted in Au and PGE relative to Cu ( Fig . 2 ) .
Primary hydrous basaltic arc magmas are derived from partial melting of the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge .
Mineral zones shown in the subducting plate indicate lower limits of stability of hydrous phases in the basaltic oceanic crust and peridotitic mantle lithosphere .

Seafloor sediments on the surface of the downgoing slab are another potential source of metasomatic contributions to the mantle wedge .
Trace elements commonly used as indicators of sediment contributions to arc magmas are Ba , B , Be , Th , and Pb ( Dreyer et al . , 2010 ; Johnson and Plank , 1999 ) , and Ba / La and Th / La ratios can be used as a measure of sediment versus mantle source components ( Plank , 2005 ; Walker et al . , 2001 ) .

Lead , which is significantly enriched in the continental crust ( and crustally - derived sediments ) relative to the mantle , is the only metal for which a clear sedimentary source can be inferred in some island arc magmas , because it can be readily identified by its radiogenic isotopic composition compared with depleted mantle sources .
Oceanic slab melting in subduction zones
Slab melts are predicted to be volatile - rich ( including H 2 O , S , and Cl ) and oxidized , and thus , like hydrous slab fluids , would be expected to be able to transport base and precious metals at least to some degree .
Hydrous basaltic magmas generated in the mantle wedge will have temperatures in excess of 1000 °C ( Eggins , 1993 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) , and perhaps as high as 1350 °C ( Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 2003 ) .
Lead and uranium are much more abundant in the bulk continental crust ( 11 ppm Pb , 1 . 3 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) or lower continental crust ( 4 ppm Pb , 0 . 2 ppm U ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) than the primitive mantle ( b0 . 2 ppm Pb , b0 . 02 ppm U ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , MORB ( 0 . 3 ppm Pb , 0 . 05 ppm U ; Sun and McDonough , 1989 ) , or typical low - K mafic arc andesites ( b1 . 8 ppm Pb , b0 . 2 ppm U ; Gill , 1981 ) , so it only requires small amounts of contamination by radiogenic crustal lead to significantly modify a magma ' s Pb isotopic composition .

Molybdenum occurs in varying amounts in porphyry - type deposits , ranging from trace levels ( b0 . 01 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits , where it may not even be recovered as a byproduct , to being the main ore component ( up to 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ) in porphyry Mo deposits ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ; Westra and Keith , 1981 ) .

Previously subduction - modified asthenosphere is unlikely to be a viable source except for a short period after subduction has ceased ( e . g . , Richards et al . , 1990 ; Solomon , 1990 ) , because such material will be quickly dispersed by mantle convection .

Bimodal magmatism is characteristic of such tectonic settings , resulting from partial melting of pelitic protoliths in the deep crust triggered by the heat from upwelling asthenospheric melts ( Hildreth , 1981 ) .
Peraluminous S - type granites ( Chappell and White , 1974 ) are subsequently emplaced as large batholith complexes in the mid - to upper orogenic crust ( e . g . , the Hercynian peraluminous granites of Europe ; Barbarin , 1996 ; Clemens , 2003 ; Darbyshire and Shepherd , 1994 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Wyllie et al . , 1976 ) .

Tin and especially tungsten commonly accompany molybdenum in porphyry deposits as trace metals and byproducts , but they also form a class of porphyries on their own , associated with S - type granites in continental orogens ( Hart et al . , 2005 ; Ishihara , 1981 ; Ishihara and Murakami , 2006 ; Kerrich and Beckinsale , 1988 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Lehmann , 1982 ) .

Magmas may be characterized by high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios due to the presence of hornblende ( ± garnet , titanite ) in the amphibolitic lower crustal source rocks .

Uranium is also significantly enriched in crustal rocks versus the mantle ( 0 . 91 ppm versus ~ 0 . 02 ppm , respectively ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , and so is unlikely to have a mantle source in such deposits .
Subduction - related magmas commonly contain at least 4 wt . % H 2 O during crustal ascent , as evidenced by the presence of hornblende and biotite phenocrysts in many andesitic volcanic rocks and arc plutons ( Burnham , 1979 ; Naney , 1983 ; Rutherford and Devine , 1988 ) .

Shallowly emplaced magmas will exsolve fluids under pressuretemperature ( P - T ) conditions that lie within the two - phase liquidvapor field for the bulk fluid composition , resulting in immediate formation of an immiscible low salinity vapor and high salinity brine ( Fig . 6a ) .
Most porphyry deposits and their host plutons are emplaced at depths between 1 and 6 km ( Seedorff et al . , 2005 ) , so fluids exsolving directly from magmas at these depths will typically form immiscible liquid and vapor plumes ( e . g . , Henley and McNabb , 1978 ; Nash , 1976 ) .

Supercritical fluids are highly mobile ( e . g . , Coumou et al . , 2008 ; Dunn and Hardee , 1981 ; Norton and Dutrow , 2001 ) and behave differently in terms of magma - fluid partitioning compared to fluids exsolved at shallower depths in the two - phase field .
Magmatic - hydrothermal ore formation
Porphyry Cu ore formation
Propylitic alteration by circulating heated groundwaters can be assumed to affect all the supracrustal rocks in the field of view , with greatest intensity ( epidote , actinolite ) close to the intrusions , fading to background distally .
Shallow crustal magma emplacement will cause extensional doming in the cover rocks , with dilational fault zones providing high - permeability pathways for fluid and magma ascent ( Burnham , 1979 ) .

Narrow focusing of apical fracturing and subsequent fluid flow are likely to be critical to the formation of high grade porphyry deposits ( e . g . , El Teniente , Chile ; Vry et al . , 2010 ) , while multiple breccia / intrusive events can potentially increase tonnage ( provided that later events do not destroy earlier mineralization ) .
Sudden depressurization of fluids across this boundary can be expected to have major effects on fluid properties , including phase separation ( Fig . 6 ) and consequent changes in metal solubility ( e . g . , Landtwing et al . , 2005Landtwing et al . , , 2010Murakami et al . , 2010 ) .

Epithermal Cu - Au ore formation 4 . 2 . 1 . High - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits
acidic ( advanced argillic ) alteration commonly found at shallow levels above porphyry systems , which is caused by acidic gasses ( H 2 SO 4 , HCl ) condensing from a low - density vapor plume .
Low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits ( including alkalic - type deposits )
Stable isotopic compositions of these fluids are generally ambiguous , and permit interpretations of the involvement of either isotopically exchanged meteoric waters or magmatic fluids , or both ( Ahmad et al . , 1987 ; Carman , 2003 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Ronacher et al . , 2004 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Zhang and Spry , 1994 ) .
Magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au , Au , Mo , and Sn - W deposits ( and related epithermal Au deposits ) , derive their metals from their associated magmas .
Assimilation and fractional crystallization processes fundamentally change the composition of the primary basaltic arc magmas to intermediate calc - alkaline compositions , with fractionated trace element patterns and evolved ( crustal ) isotopic signatures .
Seafloor sediments and basaltic oceanic crust only melt under unusually hot subduction zone conditions or locally at plate edges , and despite widespread claims of the identification of slab melts ( adakites ) in the literature based on high Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios in some evolved granitoids , this process is unlikely to be a major contributor to arc magmatism and metallogeny .

Fluid - mobile elements such as K , Rb , Cs , Ca , Sr , Ba , U , B , Pb , As , Sb , Tl , and possibly Cu , Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements , along with large amounts of H 2 O , Cl , and S , are fluxed from the dehydrating subducting slab into the mantle wedge , causing metasomatism and partial melting by lowering the peridotite solidus .
Gold and silver present in minor amounts in such deposits may also be derived from subduction sources , although there is some evidence for additional contributions from the upper plate crust ( especially for Ag , and also perhaps Mo ) .
Arc - like magmas and related porphyry and epithermal ore deposits also occur in post - subduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
Remelting can be triggered by crustal thickening and thermal rebound following arc or continent collision , delamination of sub - continental mantle lithosphere causing direct exposure of the lower crust to asthenospheric temperatures and melts , and asthenospheric upwelling during rifting of former arc crust .

At shallower depths and lower temperatures , the vapor phase may become too dilute to transport significant amounts of base metals as chloride complexes , but may continue to carry some metals such as Au , Cu , As , and Sb as sulfide complexes ( Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006Simon et al . , , 2007 , eventually either venting them to the surface in high - temperature fumaroles ( e . g . , Chaplygin et al . , 2007 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994a ; Symonds et al . , 1987 ; Tarana et al . , 1995 ; Tessalina et al . , 2008 ) or precipitating them in the near - surface high - sulfidation epithermal environment ( see Section 4 . 2 . 1 ; Deditius et al . , 2009 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1993Hedenquist et al . , , 1994bHeinrich et al . , 1999Heinrich et al . , , 2004Larocque et al . , 2008 ; Murakami et al . , 2010 ; Pudack et al . , 2009 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .

In continental arcs , it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and isotopic signatures from subducted continent - derived sediment versus crustal contamination during magma ascent ( e . g . , Hildreth and Moorbath , 1988 ; Kemp et al . , 2007 ) : both sources will contribute incompatible elements and crustal isotopic values to primary mantle - derived arc magmas ( Breeding et al . , 2004 ) .

In complex accretionary arcs , it can be very difficult to ascribe any given pluton ( and any associated mineral deposits ) to a particular subduction or collisional event , because subduction commonly continues after collision , albeit normally with a shift in the locus of magmatism .

The smaller volume of partial melting to be expected in such tectonic settings will give these magmas a somewhat more alkaline composition than arc magmas ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ) , and will also mean that large batholithic complexes are unlikely to be formed , consistent with the generally smaller and more isolated occurrence of such postsubduction magmatic systems ( compared with arc - related Cordilleran batholiths , or collisional S - type batholiths ; Pitcher , 1997 ) .

The normally relatively incompatible high field strength elements ( HFSE ) Ti , Nb , and Ta are not significantly fluid soluble under subduction zone conditions , and are retained in minerals such as rutile either in the slab or the mantle wedge ( Audétat and Keppler , 2005 ; Brenan et al . , 1994 ; Green and Adam , 2003 ) .
The low abundances of PGE in many arc - related ore deposits suggest a further separation of these elements from Au and Cu , perhaps through the formation of residual platinoid alloy phases ( e . g . , Barnes et al . , 1985 ; Borisov and Palme , 1997 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) or Cr - spinels ( into which Ir - group PGE strongly partition ; Hattori et al . , 2010 ; Righter et al . , 2004 ) .
One additional element that may be added to the mantle wedge from subducted sediments is sulfur , as suggested by the positive δ 34 S compositions of arc magmas ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , which are similar to those of seafloor sediments ( Alt et al . , 1993 ) .

The volatiles may also separate from the magma flux to form a separate fluid plume , which ultimately vents at the surface ( fumaroles ) but may also form porphyry - and epithermal - type deposits in the hypabyssal and near - surface environment ( see discussion of these processes in Sections 3 and 4 ) .

Such melts , being derived from subduction - modified sources , will share many of the characteristic geochemical features of arc magmas , including their relatively high water contents and oxidation states , and potentially metal contents ( see Section 2 . 5 . 1 ) .
The oxidation state of the mantle wedge will depend on the character of the flux from the subducting slab ( e . g . , a higher proportion of subducted organic - rich sediment would lead to lower oxidation states ; Wang et al . , 2007a ) ; this property is therefore likely to have a characteristic average value along any given arc at any particular period of time .

The Hercynian tin granites of Europe , and the Bolivian and SE Asian tin belts are examples of such deposits , with mineralization occurring in skarns and greisens around the granite intrusions , and to a lesser extent as internal stockworks and disseminations ( e . g . , Černý et al . , 2005 ; Meinert et al . , 2005 ) .

the Sn could have been extracted from the crustally - derived granites .
The lower density vapor or supercritical fluid would be expected to be highly upwardly mobile , as well as larger in terms of both volume and mass than the brine phase ( assuming an initial bulk salinity below ~ 20 wt . % NaCl ) , and so has much greater potential as an efficient transporting medium for ore components .

This process occurs most efficiently at depths greater than ~ 6 km , within large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes fed by arc or post - subduction magmas .

Such arc basalts are distinguished from MORB by higher contents of incompatible elements ( as noted above ) and water ( up to 6 wt . % H 2 O ; Cervantes and Wallace , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2003 ; Pichavant et al . , 2002 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ) .

Such magmas , they argued , should be particularly suitable for the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal porphyry copper deposits upon emplacement in the upper crust .

These trace element characteristics are therefore an indicator of high magmatic water content rather than being a source signature , and this likely explains the common association of high - Sr / Y ( i . e . , hydrous ) magmas with magmatic - hydrothermal ore depositswithout magmatic water , such deposits cannot form .

These sulfide phases will tend to deplete the magma in highly siderophile elements ( Au and PGE ) , but will not be present in sufficient volume to significantly deplete the magma in more abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo .

Such magmas therefore have the potential subsequently to form porphyry Cu - Mo deposits .
Such magmatic - metallogenic systems are thought to form by remelting of previously subductionmodified upper plate lithosphere , and in particular the lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate roots of former arc magmatic complexes .
These fluid - mobile components are also characteristically enriched in arc magmas ( e . g . , typical ranges of : 1 - 3 wt . % H 2 O , 500 - 2000 ppm Cl , 900 - 2500 ppm S ; Davidson , 1996 ; Gill , 1981 ; Noll et al . , 1996 ; Sobolev and Chaussidon , 1996 ; Wallace , 2005 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) , which is taken as evidence of aqueous fluid metasomatism of the mantle wedge magma source .

At the Mo - rich end of the spectrum , there are two clearly different tectonomagmatic associations , only one of which is directly related to subduction : calc - alkaline porphyry Mo deposits are generally relatively low grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 02 wt . % Mo ; Carten et al . , 1993 ) , whereas intra - cratonic rift - related deposits associated with high - silica , fluorine - rich , peraluminous granitoids are relatively high grade ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 wt . % Mo ; e . g . , " Climax - type " deposits ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Kirkham and Sinclair , 1996 ; Sinclair , 2007 ; Stein , 1988 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .

Under lower f S2 post - subduction conditions ( a flux of S from the subduction zone is no longer present ) , any residual sulfide phases would likely dissolve into the S - undersaturated silicate melt , carrying their metal loads with them ( e . g . , Ackerman et al . , 2009 ) .

These granites tend to be enriched in lithophile rather than chalcophile elements , reflecting their crustal origins , and may generate magmatic - hydrothermal deposits containing Sn , W , U , Mo , REE , Li , Be , B , and F .
( a ) Porphyry Cu ± Mo deposits formed in normal arc settings ; a continental arc is shown , but similar processes can occur in mature island arcs .
These high observed metal solubilities are consistent with or exceed experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on chloride complexing alone ( e . g . , Holland , 1984 , 1986 ) , and suggest that other volatile ligands such as sulfide species may enhance the solubility of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in high temperature aqueous fluids ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 1992 ; Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz et al . , 2008Zajacz et al . , , 2011 .

Given suitable fluid flow focusing , three further factors combine to cause maximum efficiency of metal deposition within relatively small volumes in porphyry Cu ± Mo ± Au deposits .
Thus , mineralization may only occur where later moderate salinity liquids have followed a higher pressure , rather specialized cooling path , as described above ( Heinrich et al . , 2004 ) .

Thus , slab melts , or adakites , could be distinguished on Sr / Y versus Y , or La / Yb versus Yb diagrams from normal arc magmas formed in the absence of garnet .
Thus , slab melts might be uniquely favorable for the subsequent generation of metal - rich , and particularly Au - rich , magmas derived from the mantle wedge .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Because subduction has ceased in these regions , a fresh supply of fluids , volatiles , and other slab - derived components to the mantle wedge no longer exists .
Thus , Cu ( and perhaps Mo ) are thought to be predominantly derived from the mantle , plus or minus contributions from the subducting slab .
During low - volume melting under relatively low f S2 conditions ( in the absence of a flux of S from active subduction ) , these sulfide phases will likely redissolve in the mildly alkaline partial melt , and may provide a source for Au - rich ( ± PGE ) post - subduction porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au systems : examples include the Roşia Montană , Skouries , Kisladag , Çöpler , and Sari Gunay porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the Neo - Tethyan belt of Romania , Greece , Turkey , and Iran , and the Grasberg , Ok Tedi , Porgera , Lihir , and Emperor porphyry Cu - Au and epithermal Au deposits in the southwest Pacific .

Because garnet is a product of such lower crustal fractionation and partial melting processes ( Alonso - Perez et al . , 2009 ; Berger et al . , 2009 ; Dufek and Bergantz , 2005 ; Garrido et al . , 2006 ; Hansen et al . , 2002 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Rushmer , 1993 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) , derivative calc - alkaline magmas may display trace element compositions that resemble adakites ( see Section 2 . 3 ) but which are unrelated to slab melting ( Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Macpherson et al . , 2006 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ; Tulloch and Kimbrough , 2003 ) .
In more oxidized or S - poor systems , smaller volumes of HSE - rich sulfide would exsolve from the silicate melt ( high R - factor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , whereas in less oxidized or S - rich systems , larger volumes of Cu - rich but HSE - poor sulfide would exsolve ( low Rfactor ; Fig . 2 ) .

Although low - sulfidation epithermal Au deposits are commonly found in volcanic terrains , their link to magmatism is more tenuous than high - sulfidation deposits , and there is commonly evidence for a greater involvement of meteoric groundwater in their formation than magmatic fluids ( e . g . , Faure et al . , 2002 ; Field and Fifarek , 1985 ; Heald et al . , 1987 ) .
However , gold enrichments may not occur where more abundant sulfides were present in the former arc complex , leading to more " normal " porphyry Cu ± Mo systems : examples include the Kerman porphyry Cu belt of central Iran , and the Gangdese porphyry Cu belt of Tibet .
Primary , mantle - derived arc magmas are basaltic , but differ from mid - ocean ridge basalt in having higher water contents ( ~ 10× higher ) , oxidation states ( ~ 2 log f O2 units higher ) , and concentrations of incompatible elements and other volatiles ( e . g . , S and Cl ) .

Moreover , porphyry Cu - ( Au ) deposits are found in association with mantlederived arc magmas worldwide , regardless of crustal type ( oceanic or continental ) or thickness ( Kesler , 1973 ) , so a crustal heritage for these metals does not appear to be critical .

Instead , small sulfide droplets or crystals may be entrained in magma ascending buoyantly through the crust ( e . g . , Bockrath et al . , 2004 ; Tomkins and Mavrogenes , 2003 ) or as inclusions in silicate phenocrysts , and will not be substantially lost to the overall magma flux .

However , the bulk of the fluids and metals in porphyry deposits are likely initially sourced at deeper levels ( 5 - 10 km , as noted above ) from larger volumes of magma in mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes ( Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cloos , 2001 ; Damon , 1986 ; John , 1991 ; Richards , 2003Richards , , 2005Shinohara and Hedenquist , 1997 ) , at which depths the fluids will be supercritical . As these deep fluids rise into shallow cupola zones extending above the main batholith , they will likely intersect the solvus on the vapor side , and will begin to condense a dense saline brine ( Ahmad and Rose , 1980 ; Figs . 6a and 7 ) .

Given the very sharp temperature gradient implied by near - surface emplacement of magma ( Fig . 7 ) , this temperature interval will correspond to a narrow depth range , likely with 1 or 2 km of the surface ( although it may extend to greater depths with time as the magmatic - hydrothermal system begins to cool ) .

Once these hybrid magmas reach basaltic andesitic to andesitic compositions , their densities are low enough to allow them to rise through the lower continental crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , but they tend to stall again at a second density barrier in the middle to upper crust below light supracrustal rocks .

Given that Au is not especially enriched in the mantle ( see above ) , and that Ag is in fact more abundant in the crust than the mantle ( 80 ppb in the bulk continental crust , versus b19 ppb in the primitive mantle ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) , a crustal source for at least some proportion of these minor metals , and especially Ag , in arc magma - related systems may be reasonable .

Under such high P - T conditions , vapors are almost as saline as the initial singlephase fluid from which they evolved , and therefore they still contain plenty of chloride for base metal complexing .

A role for mafic , mantle - derived magmas is suggested by the common association with such rocks , but their role may be predominantly as a heat source for crustal melting and a trigger for volatile saturation and eruption , rather than as a unique source of metals .

argued that slab melts should be unusually oxidized and rich in H 2 O and SO 2 ( relative to normal arc magmas derived by asthenospheric partial melting ) , although no evidence was given for this assertion .
Behavior of metals Some of the clearest evidence for the involvement of crustal rocks in continental arc magmas comes from Pb isotopic data ( e . g . , Wörner et al . , 1992 ) , although as noted in Section 2 . 2 , there may be ambiguity between lower crustal melting and the melting of subducted continentderived sediments .
A number of mineral deposits with broad similarities to those formed by subduction - related processes are also found in postsubduction tectonic settings , such as subduction reversal or migration , arc collision , continent - continent collision , and post - collisional rifting .
However , in continent - continent collision zones or where arc collision terminates subduction , there can be greater certainty about the timing of cessation of subduction magmatism .

As with the source magmas , metals in these deposits appear to be predominantly of crustal origin ( Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
Behavior of metals during magma fractionation and fluid exsolution in the upper crust
In reality , volatile exsolution is probably a more - or - less continuous process during arc magma ascent and cooling , starting at depth with the exsolution of relatively insoluble CO 2 ( Blundy et al . , 2010 ; Holloway , 1976 ; Lowenstern , 2001 ; Wallace , 2005 ) .
Focusing of magma ascent and fluid flow into narrow apical regions , or cupolas , is likely to be a function of structure in the brittle rocks overlying the batholithic system ( Tosdal and Richards , 2001 , and references therein ) .

However , in continental arcs , distinguishing a subducted sediment source of radiogenic Pb from crustal contamination during magma ascent is very difficult ( e . g . , Barreiro , 1984 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; Kontak et al . , 1990 ) .
They include porphyry Sn - W , Mo , Cu - Mo , and Cu - Au deposits and epithermal Au deposits , and in many cases are only known not to be directly related to subduction because of precise geochronology and plate tectonic reconstructions that place their formation after subduction has demonstrably ceased .

Because these post - subduction magmas are derived from amphibolitic sources in which garnet ( ± titanite ) is likely also present , and because their hydrous nature will suppress plagioclase fractionation ( similar to other hydrous arc magmas ) , they may be characterized by elevated Sr / Y and La / Yb ratios ; that is , they may display adakite - like trace element characteristics .

Although some metals may be transferred from the subducting slab via dehydration fluids , the bulk of the metals in the resultant magmas are probably derived from the asthenospheric mantle .

In contrast , Au - rich porphyry deposits may require atypical subduction - related or collisional tectonic settings and petrogenetic processes , which act to destabilize residual sulfide phases and render Au incompatible ( e . g . , Jégo et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 1995Richards , , 2009Sillitoe , 2000 ; Solomon , 1990 ; Wyborn and Sun , 1994 ; see Section 2 . 5 ) .

He argued that ferric iron is a much stronger oxidant than slabderived water , and that slab melts should be rich in Fe 3 + generated by oxidative seafloor alteration .

The relatively high oxidation state of arc magmas is a critical factor in their subsequent metallogeny , and originates from oxidative seafloor alteration of the oceanic plate ( Staudigel et al . , 1996 ) , transmitted into the mantle wedge by the metasomatic fluid flux ( Brandon and Draper , 1996 ; Kelley and Cottrell , 2009 ; Malaspina et al . , 2009 ) .

Specifically , Au - rich ( low Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form in settings where previous arc magmatism was relatively oxidized ( sparse but HSE - rich sulfide residue ) , whereas Au - poor ( high Cu / Au ) post - subduction porphyries might form where previous arc magmatism was relatively reduced ( more abundant Cu - rich sulfide residue ) .

Consequently , the bulk of Cu - sulfide mineralization occurs at the low - temperature , late - stage end of the potassic alteration phase , just prior to the onset of phyllic alteration ( i . e . , corresponding to the " ore shell " of the classic Lowell and Guilbert , 1970 , porphyry Cu model ) .

Nevertheless , alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits , which are mineralogically similar to low - sulfidation deposits ( adularia and sericiteor roscoelite [ vanadium mica ] are stable ) , do show a strong temporal and genetic relationship to alkalic magmas , typically in relatively small and isolated intrusive complexes located in backarc or post - subduction settings ( e . g . , Jensen and Barton , 2000 ; Kelley et al . , 1998 ; Müller and Groves , 1993 ; Mutschler et al . , 1985 ; Richards , 1995 ; Thompson et al . , 1985 ) .

The majority of normal arc porphyry systems are generated from hydrous mantle wedge melts that have interacted to varying degrees with the upper plate lithosphere during passage towards the surface .
The behavior of highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) such as Au and PGE is less well known under these conditions , but studies of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from island arc lavas suggest that Au , Re , and the Pd - group elements ( including Pt ) are mobilized into the mantle wedge during subduction metasomatism ( Dale et al . , 2009 ; Kepezhinskas et al . , 2002 ; McInnes et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2004a ; Widom et al . , 2003 ) .
The behavior of chalcophile and siderophile metals during subsequent partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge depends critically on oxidation state ( f O2 ) and sulfur fugacity ( f S2 ) , because these parameters control the stability and abundance of sulfide phases .

Partitioning of metals from magma into exsolving hydrothermal fluid
Observations of chalcopyrite crystals trapped in some vapor - rich fluid inclusions ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ) were explained by some as products of heterogeneous trapping ( see discussion in Mavrogenes and Note that in the two - phase field , the dense saline liquid phase progressively separates from the vapour phase , and the two - phase pathways shown do not represent a closed system .
To some extent , focusing of magma and fluid flow along narrow conduits may be self - organizational , because once initial channel ways have developed , they will represent high - permeability pathways and are likely to thermally weaken the wall rocks and promote further fracturing and channeling .
Ore formation in porphyry and related epithermal environments is critically dependent on the partitioning of metals from the magma into an exsolving magmatic - hydrothermal fluid phase .
In either case , metals are envisaged to be sourced from the mantle wedge , not the slab .
Nevertheless , a lower crustal source , perhaps hybridized with mantle - derived magmas , has been proposed by Bouse et al . ( 1999 ) for both magmas and metals in the Laramide porphyry systems of Arizona .

Observations from rare fluid inclusions in high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au deposits suggest that the ore - forming fluid was a low - to moderatesalinity liquid ( 0 . 2 to 4 . 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) , which paragenetically post - dates advanced argillic alteration formed by highly acidic magmatic gasses ( Arribas , 1995 ; Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Stoffregen , 1987 ) .
Sources of these magmas include subduction - metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge , basaltic oceanic crust and / or seafloor sediments , and , in post - subduction settings , subduction - modified upper plate lithosphere .
The idea that the hydrated basaltic ocean crust might melt during subduction was an early assumption of the plate tectonic revolution , because it seemed conveniently to explain the relatively felsic composition of arc magmas ( as opposed to basalts formed by melting of peridotitic mantle ) .

In these models , sulfide phases subsequently break down due to changes in oxidation state and sulfur fugacity in response to volatile exsolution and magnetite crystallization upon emplacement in the upper crust , thereby rendering metals available for redissolution in the volatile phase ( e . g . , Cygan and Candela , 1995 ; Halter et al . , 2002Halter et al . , , 2005Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Keith et al . , 1997 ; Stavast et al . , 2006 ) .

Direct evidence for slab melting is lacking , but supra - subduction zone xenoliths from the Tabar - Lihir - Tanga - Feni ( Papua New Guinea ) , Philippine , and Patagonian arcs preserve hydrous , silica - rich glass inclusions that are thought to represent migrating slab melts ( respectively : Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) .
On the other hand , minor amounts of Mo do occur in some island arc - related porphyry deposits where no continental crustal sources are inferred ( Westra and Keith , 1981 ) , so a mantle ( subduction zone ) source for at least some Mo cannot be excluded .

Consequently , such magmas may be sulfide - saturated ( at oxidation states up to ΔFMQ + 2 . 3 ; Jugo , 2009 ) despite sulfur being predominantly present in the melt as sulfate or SO 2 ( Carroll and Rutherford , 1985 ) .
Thus , if extensive fractionation and removal of magmatic sulfide phases were to occur , the remaining silicate melt would be strongly depleted in these elements ( Jugo et al . , 1999 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ) .
This may explain the Cu - rich nature of typical arc - related porphyry deposits ( relative to Au and PGE ; Richards , 2005 ) .
Here , if the flux of magma and heat is maintained and supplemented by the latent heat of crystallization as the magma begins to crystallize , high temperatures can be brought to bear on lower crustal rocks that will cause partial melting ( Annen et al . , 2006 ; Bergantz and Dawes , 1994 ; Huppert and Sparks , 1988 ; Klepeis et al . , 2003 ; Petford and Gallagher , 2001 ; Rushmer , 1993 ) .

When combined with the higher mass proportion of the vapor phase ( versus brine condensate ) and its high mobility , a model for transport of the bulk of the metal flux in porphyries by relatively dense vapors or supercritical fluids is now well established ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2010 ; Williams - Jones and Heinrich , 2005 ) .
With the exception of porphyry Sn - W deposits that are associated with crustally derived S - type granites , most other deposits in this grouping are formed by calc - alkaline to mildly alkaline I - type granitoids directly or indirectly related to subduction .

Under such conditions , metals will partition efficiently into a single - phase , supercritical aqueous fluid ( ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) , which may exist as a separate volatile plume or as bubbles entrained in buoyant magma .
This would give rise to magmas with relatively high Cu / Au ratios ( which might form Cu - rich porphyry deposits ) , but would leave a residue of potentially HSE - rich sulfides in the mantle and / or lower crustal amphibolitic cumulate arc roots .

Key to the formation of magmatic - hydrothermal deposits of chalcophile and siderophile elements in the upper crust is the lack of significant saturation with and loss of sulfide phases prior to aqueous volatile exsolution from a cooling magma ( Candela , 1989b ( Candela , , 1992Candela and Holland , 1986 ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Richards , 1995 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ; Spooner , 1993 ) .

The composition of this exsolved magmatic volatile phase is dominantly aqueous , containing sulfur species ( predominantly SO 2 in oxidized systems , but also some reduced S species ) , CO 2 , NaCl , KCl , HCl , and metal chlorides .
The first factor is that Cu solubility ( as chloride species ) decreases dramatically as fluids cool through the temperature interval ~ 400°to 300 °C ( Crerar and Barnes , 1976 ; Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 1998 ) .
Below these depths , the anhydrous eclogitic crust is essentially infusible , and the dense slab continues its descent into the mantle without melting .

This modification to the adakite slab - melting model is required to explain the high contents of MgO , Ni , and Cr present in some adakites relative to expected levels for hydrated basalt partial melts ( Defant and Kepezhinskas , 2001 ; Drummond et al . , 1996 ; Martin , 1999 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 1995 ) .

The second factor is that SO 2 dissolved in the magmatichydrothermal fluid phase progressively disproportionates to H 2 S and H 2 SO 4 as the fluid cools below ~ 400 °C ( Holland , 1965 ; Kusakabe et al . , 2000 ; Reeves et al . , 2010 ; Sakai and Matsubaya , 1977 ) : 4SO 2 + 4H 2 O ⇔ H 2 S + 3H 2 SO 4 : ð1Þ This reaction generates both hydrogen sulfide , which initiates abundant precipitation of sulfide minerals ( i . e . , chalcopyrite , pyrite , molybdenite ) , and also sulfuric acid , which causes early deposition of large volumes of anhydrite in the potassic alteration zone , and progressively increasing degrees of hydrolytic alteration ( an initial shift from feldspar - stable potassic alteration , to muscovite / sericitestable phyllic alteration ) .

The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
The range of salinity for typical deeply exsolved singlephase ( supercritical ) magmatic fluids ( 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl ) is shown in gray .
However , the bulk of the magmatic water content likely exsolves relatively rapidly as the magma approaches its solvus , at depths of ~ 5 - 10 km , depending on magma composition and water content ( Burnham , 1979 ) .
The critical point in the H 2 O - NaCl system ( which is commonly used as a proxy for magmatic fluids ) occurs between ~ 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 kb for fluid temperatures between 600°and 800 °C ( the typical temperature range for fluids exsolved from intermediate to felsic magmas ) ( Pitzer and Pabalan , 1986 ; Sourirajan and Kennedy , 1962 ) , which is equivalent to depths of between ~ 3 and 5 km at lithostatic pressures .
However , although a clear sediment - derived isotopic signature can be observed in many island arc systems , the volumetric contribution of sediments to island arc magmas seems to be relatively minor ( Hawkesworth et al . , 1994 ; Kilian and Behrmann , 2003 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Stern et al . , 2006 ) .
However , analyses of such metals ( except iron ) are not reported in most melt inclusion studies ( e . g . , Kilian and Stern , 2002 ; McInnes and Cameron , 1994 ; Schiano et al . , 1995 ) , so there are no direct constraints on the capacity of such melts to transfer chalcophile and siderophile metals from the slab to the mantle wedge .
The most likely reasons for otherwise prospective porphyry systems to be unproductive will be either a failure to focus fluid flow , or simply insufficient fluid supply ( likely due to an insufficiently large underlying magmatic system ) .

The question of whether the downgoing oceanic slab , or more specifically the basaltic oceanic crust , melts during subduction has prompted lively debate recently , not only in the petrology literature ( e . g . , Conrey , 2002 ; Kepezhinskas , 2001 , 2002 ; Garrison and Davidson , 2003 ) , but also amongst economic geologists because of the suggestion that " slab melts " might in some way be uniquely fertile for later porphyry ore formation ( e . g . , Mungall , 2002 ; Oyarzun et al . , , 2002Sajona and Maury , 1998 ; Thiéblemont et al . , 1997 ; for contrary opinions , see : Rabbia et al . , 2002 ; Richards , 2002 ; Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .

Water lowers the solidus of silicate assemblages , and will lead to the formation of hydrous partial melts during pro - grade metamorphism or mafic melt invasion ( Beard and Lofgren , 1991 ; Rushmer , 1991 ; Wolf and Wyllie , 1994 ) .

As noted in Section 2 . 5 , subduction - modified asthenospheric sources will be rapidly convected away when subduction ceases , and so could only contribute to immediately post - subduction magmatism .
These fluids either rise as bubbly magma or as a separate volatile plume into the apical parts of the system where decreasing pressure and temperature cause deposition of Cu and Mo ± Au ( Candela , 1989b ; Shinohara et al . , 1995 ) .

This model requires that the vapor leaves the two - phase surface again by cooling at pressure , thereby passing over the crest of the solvus ( the critical curve ; ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) ; upon subsequent ascent and depressurization , this fluid will be a liquid , as described above .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; below the vapor - halite ( V - H ) solvus , vapor curves are shown in orange .
In contrast , in the case of W skarns associated with Mo mineralization in calc - alkaline I - type magmas , a shared mantle origin with Mo might be indicated ( e . g . , Newberry and Swanson , 1986 ) , consistent with the similar siderophile tendencies of these two elements , and their position in the periodic table ( group VIB ) .
Red curves indicate that the solvus phase is a vapor , blue curves that it is a liquid ; the transition point corresponds to the critical point for that composition .

The latter , however , likely oxidize and disperse geologically rapidly after formation on the seafloor ( e . g . , Edwards , 2004 ; Herzig et al . , 1991 ) unless quickly buried by lava ; they might thus only be expected to be subducted with very young oceanic crust .
This has led to one view that Mo might be predominantly derived from continental crustal sources ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ; Klemm et al . , 2008 ; White et al . , 1981 ) .
In response to the decreasing solubility of water in silicate melts as pressure decreases , such hydrous magmas inevitably exsolve an aqueous volatile phase upon emplacement at shallow crustal levels or on eruption ( Burnham , 1979 ( Burnham , , 1997Eichelberger , 1995 ) .

The focus of this paper is on the flux of metals in subductionrelated magmatic systems , but this would be of little practical interest if that flux did not ultimately lead to ore formation .

In Cloos ' s ( 2001 ) model , volatile - rich , bubbly magma rising from the underlying batholith convects through the cupola zone where it releases its fluids , whereas in Shinohara and Hedenquist ' s ( 1997 ) model , vesiculation and convective circulation occur in the underlying magma chamber itself , and fluids are released as a plume into the base of the apical dike system .
However , the close link with magmatism in alkalic - type systems suggests that a magmatic fluid source is more likely ( e . g . , Carman , 2003 ; Scherbarth and Spry , 2006 ; Simmons and Brown , 2007 ) , and the vapor contraction model described in Section 4 . 2 . 1 could explain the observed characteristics of these ore fluids ( i . e . , direct contraction to a moderate salinity liquid from a high temperature magmatic fluid at depth ) .
Potential sources of metals in arc magmas include the oceanic crust and sediments ( via dehydration fluids or melting ) , the mantle wedge , and the upper plate crust .
Analyses of glass inclusions in olivine from primitive arc magmas reveal concentrations of up to 2900 ppm S ( de Hoog et al . , 2001 ) , andJugo et al . ( 2005b ) measured experimental concentrations of up to 1 . 5 wt . % S in oxidized arc basalts .
The chemical difference between slab dehydration and slab melting would seem to be rather small , given that both media would be enriched in volatiles , incompatible elements , and silica .
As discussed in Section 2 . 1 , arc magmas are characterized by high f O2 and f S2 relative to normal melts from MORB - depleted asthenosphere .
Regardless of the exact role of magmatic sulfides , the ultimate relationship is that of partitioning of metals between silicate melts and exsolving hydrothermal fluids , with sulfides as a possible intermediary step .
This depth range is typical for ore formation in many porphyry systems .
Such common processes , affecting batches of magma crystallizing and fractionating at different crustal depths ( e . g . , Annen et al . , 2006 ) are entirely consistent with petrological observations in arc volcanic systems where " adakite - like " ( i . e . , high - Sr / Y ) andesitic lavas may be interlayered with " normal " andesites in a single volcano , and do not require a fundamental change in magma source 100 km below the volcano ( e . g . , Feeley and Davidson , 1994 ; Grunder et al . , 2008 ; Richards et al . , 2006a ) .

A similar assumption is made for Au , although the primitive mantle and continental crust actually have comparable concentrations ( 1 - 3 ppb Au ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ; Taylor and McLennan , 1985 ) .

All three effects are related to the steep temperature gradient in the cupola zone ( Fig . 7 ) , and they therefore control the vertical range of ore deposition .
This occurs either through direct infiltration metasomatism by slab - derived fluids percolating into the hot inner zone of the mantle wedge ( Bourdon et al . , 2003 ; Grove et al . , 2006 ; Kelley et al . , 2010 ; Peacock , 1993 ) , or by convective corner - flow mixing of metasomatized peridotite into these hotter central regions ( Fig . 1 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Tatsumi , 1986 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
The key to all of these models is subduction - derived water , which is most likely stored in amphibolitic cumulates , residual from the earlier arc magma flux and located in the deep crust or mantle lithosphere ( e . g . , Claeson and Meurer , 2004 ; Davidson et al . , 2007 ; DeBari and Coleman , 1989 ; Jagoutz et al . , 2009 ; Larocque and Canil , 2010 ; Müntener and Ulmer , 2006 ; Tiepolo and Tribuzio , 2008 ) .

In particular , the proportion of sulfides exsolving from arc magmas may be very sensitive to small changes in their oxidation state , because of the rapid change from sulfide to sulfate dominance in magmatic systems between ΔFMQ + 1 and + 2 ( Jugo et al . , 2010 ) .
What subsequently happens to that fluid phase dictates whether economic concentrations of metals are precipitated ( grade ) , whereas the scale of the magmatic and derivative hydrothermal system controls the total amount of metals precipitated ( tonnage ) .
They are distinguished from normal subductionrelated suites by slightly higher magmatic alkali ( K 2 O and Na 2 O ) contents , and by the occurrence of Au - rich deposits ( although normal porphyry Cu - Mo deposits can also occur ) .

Structure and processes beneath an oceanic island arc ( sources : Tatsumi and Eggins , 1995 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Winter , 2001 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ) .
They thus compositionally resemble melts that would be predicted to form from slab melting , and appear to provide evidence that this process occurs at least locally where conditions permit .
Because of the association of these deposits with relatively small intrusive complexes , and therefore a smaller crustal thermal anomaly , a shallower fluid P - T path with cooling at depth is more likely , consistent with a model of vapor contraction .

A corollary of this diagram is that arc magmatism will leave small amounts of relatively Au - rich sulfide in the mantle source or lithosphere during fractionation , which can be remelted during post - subduction tectonomagmatic processes , to form small - volume , alkaline , porphyry Au - potential magmas .

A complication is introduced in the Climax - type deposits , because although the immediate source of the Mo - bearing fluids is felsic magma of clear crustal origin , many deposits also show a close genetic association with mafic alkaline magmas , which may have introduced volatiles , S , and possibly Mo into the evolved felsic magma chamber ( Audétat , 2010 ; Carten et al . , 1993 ; Keith et al . , 1986Keith et al . , , 1998 .

The high partition coefficients for chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( HSE ) between sulfide phases and silicate melt mean that such metals should be strongly partitioned into any coexisting sulfide phases ( Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Although there is some evidence for slab - derived fluid contributions of chalcophile and highly siderophile elements ( Cu , Au , PGE ) to the mantle wedge , it is not clear that this is a necessary metallogenic step , the upper mantle already containing significant amounts of these elements .

The advent of quantitative analysis of single fluid inclusions by synchrotron X - ray microprobe , proton - induced X - ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) , and laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) revealed that , contrary to these earlier assumptions , considerable amounts of metal , including Cu and Au , were indeed consistently present in some vapor - rich inclusions ( Audétat et al . , 2000 ; Harris et al . , 2003 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Lowenstern et al . , 1991 ; Simon et al . , 2005Simon et al . , , 2006Ulrich et al . , 2001 ) , and subsequent work has shown that much of this metal content is transported as sulfide complexes rather than as ( or in addition to ) chloride complexes ( Cauzid et al . , 2007 ; Heinrich et al . , 1992Heinrich et al . , , 1999Pokrovski et al . , 2005Pokrovski et al . , , 2008Seo et al . , 2009 ; Simon et al . , 2006 ; Zajacz and Halter , 2009 ; Zajacz et al . , 2010 ) .

Typical temperature - depth ranges for supercritical magmatic fluid exsolution , early high - temperature porphyry veins , later main - stage brittle porphyry veins , and epithermal mineralization are indicated .
It is therefore challenging to isolate geochemical and isotopic characteristics of magma source regions from the effects of later processes ( Davidson , 1996 ) .

These include , from east to west , the Miocene Gangdese porphyry Cu - Mo belt in the Tibetan orogen ( Hou et al . , 2006 ( Hou et al . , , 2009Yang et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Kerman porphyry Cu - Mo belt in southeastern Iran ( Shafiei et al . , 2009 ) , the Miocene Sari Gunay epithermal Au deposit in northwestern Iran ( Richards et al . , 2006b ) , the Eocene Çöpler epithermal Au deposit in southeastern Turkey ( Keskin et al . , 2008 ; Kuscu et al . , 2010 ) , the Pliocene Kisladag porphyry Au deposit in western Turkey , the Miocene Skouries porphyry Cu - Au - PGE deposit in Greece ( Economou - Eliopoulos and Eliopoulos , 2000 ) , and the Roşia Montană epithermal Au deposit in Romania ( Manske et al . , 2006 ; Neubauer et al . , 2005 ) .
Similar stable isotopic data from other low - sulfidation deposits are commonly interpreted to reflect a meteoric fluid source because of the absence of clearly coeval magmatism ( as noted above ) .
Such systems raise an additional set of petrogenetic and metallogenic questions .
Sediment contributions to the source of arc magmas have been the subject of numerous studies , with the least ambiguous evidence coming from island arcs ( e . g . , MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Thirlwall et al . , 1996 ; Wysoczanski et al . , 2006 ) .
Few studies have specifically invoked a subducted sediment source for ore metals other than a component of Pb , and the majority of authors have concluded that such a source is either unnecessary or unproven ( e . g . , Burnham , 1981 ; Chiaradia et al . , 2004 ; de Hoog et al . , 2001 ; Fontboté et al . , 1990 ) .
Inferring a seafloor sediment source for other metallic components in arc magmas ( and related ore deposits ) is much more speculative , and generally involves the subduction of metal - rich manganese nodules or even massive sulfide deposits .
This is the level ( 5 - 10 km ) at which large arc batholiths will form if the flux of magma is sustained , and is also the level at which evolved felsic melts and volatiles are accumulated ( Fig . 3 ; see Richards , 2003 , and references therein ) .

Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) argued that the Fe - rich brine condensation step is essential for retention of Au ( and Cu ) in the vapor phase , because otherwise Fe will tend to precipitate as Cu - Fe - sulfide minerals and strip the fluid of bisulfide ligands , thus causing Au to coprecipitate at depth ( a possible mechanism for the formation of porphyry Cu - Au deposits ) .
Likely , a more important control on the metal content of subsequent partial melts is the abundance and stability of residual sulfide phases in the asthenospheric mantle source .
The most important contributions from the slab from a metallogenic perspective are H 2 O , S , and Cl , as well as oxidants .
Except for magmas produced and erupted in extensional tectonic regimes ( where rapid ascent to the surface is facilitated by normal faulting ) , most deeply - derived magmas undergo some degree of fractionation and crustal contamination during their passage towards the surface .
Indeed , several authors have argued that pre - concentration of ore metals in magmatic sulfide phases may be an important step in porphyry metallogenesis ( e . g . , Jenner et al . , 2010 ) .
As Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) noted , such acidic vapors do not appear to transport Au ( or Cu ) effectively because bisulfide ( HS - ) ligands are hydrolized to H 2 S . This may explain why advanced argillic alteration caps are commonly barren ( in terms of Au and Cu ) and merely generate permeability that potentially focuses later ore - forming fluid flow .
In particular , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , Pb , As , and Sb are strongly mobilized by such fluids , possibly along with Tl and Cu ( Noll et al . , 1996 ) .
Two theoretical studies have proposed that slab melts should be unusually effective as metal - transporting and ore - forming agents .
A control on these two scenarios ( abundant Cu - rich residual sulfide versus sparse but HSE - rich residual sulfide , or low versus high R - factor ) might be the average oxidation state and sulfur fugacity of the generative subduction system .
This likely explains why the debate between slab melting and dehydration is somewhat intractable , and mostly hinges on subtle trace element characteristics .

As shown in Fig . 2 , at high abundances of sulfide relative to silicate melt ( low Rfactor ; Campbell and Naldrett , 1979 ) , the melts will be depleted in all of these chalcophile and siderophile elements .

Schematic cross - section through a typical coupled arc batholith - cupola - volcanic system , with associated porphyry Cu ± Au and linked high sulfidation Cu - Au epithermal deposits .
This is in essence the model for formation of orthomagmatic sulfide deposits from relatively reduced mafic magmas ( e . g . , Naldrett , 1989 ) , and perhaps explains the deficiency of chalcophile elements such as Cu and Au in more reduced , evolved , Sn - W - bearing S - type magmas ( Blevin and Chappell , 1992 ; Hedenquist and Lowenstern , 1994 ) .
A key aspect of both of these models is that volatile separation , and Cu partitioning , occurs from a much larger volume of magma ( emplaced at deeper levels ) than that preserved and commonly visible within the shallow - level ore body .

Because their densities will be lower than the mantle but not the crust ( Herzberg et al . , 1983 ) , they will tend to rise from their asthenospheric source region and penetrate the mantle lithosphere , but pool at the crust / mantle density barrier ( " level of neutral buoyancy " : Fig . 3 ; Fyfe , 1992 ; Hildreth , 1981 ) .
This model can also explain the occurrence of Au - poor porphyry Cu - ( Mo ) deposits in post - subduction settings , such as those in Tibet and Iran ( Hou et al . , 2009 ; Shafiei et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2007b ) , the only difference being that in this case larger proportions of sulfide may have fractionated out from the original arc magmas in the deep crust .

A more normal , or early ascent pathway for a magmatichydrothermal fluid would be for it to rise more - or - less is enthalpically or quasi - adiabatically along a steep P - T gradient ( e . g . , Hemley and Hunt , 1992 ; Henley and Hughes , 2000 ; Wood and Spera , 1984 ) , and therefore to dive deeply into the two - phase field and separate into an increasingly dilute vapor phase and a saline brine ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 1 ) , or even to boil dry to halite plus vapor ( Figs . 6 and 9 , path 2 ) .
Consequently , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that normal arc magmas will be minimally depleted in Cu ( due to its higher abundance and moderate chalcophile nature ) relative to sparse , highly siderophile elements such as Au and PGE , which will be strongly retained in residual sulfide phases in the source region ( e . g . , Hamlyn et al . , 1985 ; Mitchell and Keays , 1981 ; Peach et al . , 1990 ) .
Consequently , many researchers have implicated upper - plate lithospheric sources , modified by earlier subduction - related fluids and / or hydrous melts ( e . g . , Clemens et al . , 2009 ; Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Guo et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 1986 ; Johnson et al . , 1978 ; Pearce et al . , 1990 ; Pettke et al . , 2010 ; Richards , 2009 ) .

This paper firstly examines the source of normal arc magmas , and concludes that they are predominantly derived from partial melting of the metasomatized mantle wedge , with possible minor contributions from subducted sediments .
However , despite the theoretical possibility of melting subducted oceanic crust , most thermal models of subduction zones indicate that temperatures in the slab do not normally reach melting conditions ( N800 °C ) prior to dehydration and eclogitization ( Fig . 1 ) , which would render the slab infusible ( e . g . , Davies and Stevenson , 1992 ; Peacock , 1996 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ) .
As noted in Section 3 . 1 , although the bulk of Cu ( and Mo ) appears to be precipitated over the temperature interval 425° - 320 °C , some Cu and other metals such as Au , Sb , and As may remain in solution as sulfide complexes , to be carried into the shallow epithermal regime .
This apparent inconsistency has been explained by vapor by rapid cooling during ascent such that it does not touch , or barely touches , the two - phase solvus ( Figs . 6b and 9 , paths 3 and 4 , respectively ) .
Thus , Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) proposed that slab melting might be restricted to the subduction of young ( ≤25 m . y .
Igneous petrologists are broadly in agreement that arc magmas are primarily derived from hydrous melting of the asthenospheric mantle wedge above subducting plates , but melts from the subducted oceanic crust ( including sediments ) and the upper plate lithosphere may also be involved to varying degrees .

Various experimental studies have shown that these minerals undergo dehydration reactions over a depth range extending to ~ 100 km , corresponding to the blueschist - eclogite transition in crustal rocks ; serpentine ( antigorite ) and the 10 Å equivalent of chlorite may extend this range to 200 km ( e . g . , Dvir et al . , 2011 ; Forneris and Holloway , 2003 ; Fumagalli and Poli , 2005 ; Poli and Schmidt , 2002 ; Schmidt and Poli , 1998 ; Ulmer and Trommsdorff , 1995 ) .
Mungall ( 2002 ) presented a theoretical model for oxidation of the mantle wedge by Fe 3 + - rich slab melts to the point of complete sulfide destruction , thereby rendering chalcophile and siderophile elements incompatible in mantle phases , and free to partition into silicate melts .

In contrast , model does not address the source of metals , and is at root based on the assumption that slab melts are uniquely more H 2 O - and SO 2 - rich , and more oxidized than normal arc magmas , leading to specific ore depositional processes rather than source processes .

Numerous studies have explored the character of the fluids that are released from the dehydrating slab , because they are thought to account for the unique geochemical character of subduction - related magmas during later partial melting in the metasomatized asthenospheric mantle wedge ( located between the downgoing slab and the upper plate ) .
However , because of the equilibria between various sulfur species , at high f S2 some condensed sulfide phases will likely also be present ( McInnes et al . , 2001 ) .
Cline ( 1995 ) concluded that optimum conditions for porphyry Cu ore formation are obtained where magma containing ~ 4 wt . % H 2 O and with a high initial Cl / H 2 O ( typical of most arc magmas ) is emplaced at moderate crustal depths , thereby maximizing the efficiency of Cu partitioning into an early saline fluid phase .

In combination , the highest grades will occur where ore deposition is both focused laterally and restricted vertically .
Defant and Drummond ( 1990 ) termed the products of subducted slab melting " adakites " , after a single anomalous lava flow on Adak Island in the Aleutians described by Kay ( 1978 ) .
Similarly , in the southwest Pacific ocean , accurate plate tectonic reconstructions permit the identification of a number of postsubduction porphyry and epithermal deposits , such as the Grasberg porphyry Cu - Au deposit in Papua , Indonesia ( Cloos et al . , 2005 ; Paterson and Cloos , 2005 ) , the Ok Tedi porphyry Cu - Au deposit ( van Dongen et al . , 2010 ) and the Porgera alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in mainland Papua New Guinea ( Richards et al . , 1990 ; Richards and Kerrich , 1993 ) , the Lihir alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit on Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea ( Carman , 2003 ; Kennedy et al . , 1990 ) , and the Emperor alkalic - type epithermal Au deposit in Fiji ( Gill and Whelan , 1989 ; Setterfield et al . , 1992 ) .

However , until fairly recently , it was assumed that low salinity vapors would not have the capacity to dissolve large quantities of base metals as chloride complexes , and the brine phase was therefore the favored ore - forming medium ( e . g . , Bodnar and Beane , 1980 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Eastoe , 1982 ; Hedenquist and Richards , 1998 ; Moore and Nash , 1974 ; Nash , 1976 ; Shinohara , 1994 ; Williams et al . , 1995 ) .

The rapid reduction in the efficiency of transport of metals as the vapor plume rises , cools , and becomes less dense by brine condensation , may explain precipitation of the bulk of Cu , Mo , and some Au over a relatively narrow temperature interval between 425° - 320 °C Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) .

A further complication is added by the fact that most adakites described in the petrology literature are not in fact primary slab melts , but are substantially evolved , having reacted or hybridized with the asthenosphere during ascent ( and likely also the upper plate lithosphere ) .

Intriguingly , they noted no such correlation between HFSE - enrichments and Au , and concluded that , whereas PGE might be transported into the mantle wedge by both fluids and melts , Au was likely only carried by hydrous fluids .
For example , in a recent assessment of the source of Sn in the Cornubian batholith of SW England , Williamson et al . ( 2010 ) concluded that all of Fig . 4 .
But perhaps more importantly , as noted above , these vapors will also contain a high concentration of volatile sulfur species , which now appear to be essential for the efficient solvation of chalcophile elements under high P - T conditions .

For example , the authors showed that 15 - 90 km 3 of andesitic magma initially containing 50 ppm Cu , 2 . 5 wt . % H 2 O , and with a Cl / H 2 O ratio = 1 , is sufficient to generate a 250 Mt deposit with a grade of 0 . 75 wt . % Cu .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .
Note the scale change on the salinity axis at 1 wt . % NaCl , in order to illustrate the extremely low salinity of low - temperature vapor phases .
Economic geologists are also broadly in agreement that ore - forming elements are partitioned from such magmas into an exsolving volatile phase upon emplacement in the upper crust , and may then be precipitated from these fluids during cooling , fluid mixing , and wallrock reaction processes in porphyry - type and related epithermal mineral deposits .

These processes are examined , closing with a review of fluid and metal sources and behavior in related epithermal environments .
Not only do these processes result in the formation of open - standing brittle veins and porosity , thereby facilitating rapid upward fluid flow and wallrock permeation ( e . g . , the crackle breccias , stockworks , and disseminated mineralization textures so characteristic of porphyry Cu deposits ) , but this transition also represents the boundary between lithostatic and hydrostatic fluid pressures ( a pressure differential of 3× ) .
The volumetric extent and efficiency of mobilization of metals into the mantle wedge by this process are unknown , but fluid metasomatism clearly represents one viable mechanism for metal transfer into arc magma sources .
Thus , at this time there is no consensus regarding the crustal versus mantle origin of molybdenum in porphyry deposits , although it is clear that the highest grade porphyry Mo deposits are formed in intra - plate continental settings , and if a mantle source is important in these cases , it is not directly related to subduction activity but rather to rifting or reactivation of previously subduction - enriched lithospheric sources .

Such a mechanism might also explain why coeval belts of porphyry deposits tend to have characteristic Cu / Au ratios .

( Note that these depths reflect the locus of fluid and metal exsolution from the magma under lithostatic pressure conditions , as opposed to the depth of subsequent hydrothermal metal deposition , which will be at shallower levels and likely under hydrostatic pressure conditions ; Fournier , 1999 . )
Other relatively uncommon scenarios that might result in slab melting include shallow or stalled subduction ( whereby the slab has more time to heat up at shallow depths ; Gutscher et al . , 2000 ; Peacock et al . , 1994 ) , ridge subduction ( Guivel et al . , 2003 ; Kay et al . , 1993 ) , or edge - melting of detached slabs or slab windows ( Haschke and Ben - Avraham , 2005 ; Thorkelson and Breitsprecher , 2005 ; Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) .

Pettke et al . ( 2010 ) have proposed a similar model for giant porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposits in the southwestern USA .

In particular , Henley and McNabb ( 1978 ) suggested that the higher density and viscosity of saline brine condensates might restrict their flow , leaving them as a dense residual liquid in the deeper parts of evolving magmatic hydrothermal systems ( see also : Lewis and Lowell , 2009 ; White et al . , 1971 ) .

However , these process theories do not address where the metals originally came from , nor why porphyry deposits vary so widely in their metal contents ( from Au - rich , through Cu ± Mo ± Au , to Moonly deposits , with Sn - W deposits forming a distinct variant ) .
There is a general consensus that , with the exception of young oceanic lithosphere ( b25 m . y . - old ; Defant and Drummond , 1990 ) or plate edges ( Yogodzinski et al . , 2001 ) , basaltic oceanic crust undergoes low - temperature , high pressure metamorphism upon subduction , which releases fluids through a series of prograde dehydration reactions to form anhydrous eclogite ( Fig . 1 ) .
Thus , it is not clear that a particularly large amount of Pb in arc magmas is sourced from crustal rocks versus the subduction zone , and Macfarlane et al . ( 1990 ) have argued that the crustal contribution is minimal in Central Andean magmas and ores .
Most researchers have assumed that , because of the higher concentrations of Cu in primitive andesites ( 145 ppm ; Gill , 1981 ) compared with the bulk continental crust ( 27 ppm ; Rudnick and Gao , 2003 ) , the bulk of Cu in porphyry - type deposits is mantle - derived .

This process has in the past rather confusingly been called first and second boiling ( although neither process is technically " boiling " ) , the first event occurring during ascent and depressurization of the magma , and the second occurring after emplacement as crystallization progressively increases the concentration of volatiles in the residual melt ( Candela , 1989a ) .
In the following sections , I review some of the key factors in metal solvation and transport in magmatichydrothermal fluids .
The exact composition depends on many variables , including the depth of exsolution and the magma composition ( especially the initial magmatic Cl / H 2 O ratio and alkali content ; Candela , 1989c ; Candela and Piccoli , 2005 ; Cline and Bodnar , 1991 ; Webster , 1992 ) , but typical estimates for a single - phase supercritical fluid exsolved at depths below the H 2 O - NaCl solvus are ~ 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl equivalent ( average 5 wt . % NaCl equivalent ) with minor CO 2 ( Audétat and Pettke , 2003 ; Audétat et al . , 2008 ; Burnham , 1979 ; Candela , 1989c ; John , 1991 ; Redmond et al . , 2004 ) , and up to 1 . 3 wt . % Cu and 0 . 3 wt . % Fe ( Klemm et al . , 2007 ; Rusk et al . , 2004Rusk et al . , , 2008Sawkins and Scherkenbach , 1981 ) .

Igneous petrologists seek to understand the petrogenesis of such magmas through geochemical and isotopic tracing , whereas economic geologists are generally more interested in the source of potentially valuable elements such as Cu , Mo , Sn , W , Au , and platinum group elements ( PGE ) , which may ultimately be found in intrusion - related hydrothermal deposits .
Mungall ' s ( 2002 ) model may have applicability for less common Aurich porphyry deposits formed in atypical subduction zone settings that might cause slab melting , but does not seem well suited to explain regular arc porphyry Cu deposits .
Nevertheless , the broad geochemical similarity of many of these magmas to normal arc magmas , including their hydrous and generally oxidized nature , suggests some link to subduction metasomatism .

In contrast , Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) envisaged fluids physically separating from the magma at greater depth within the underlying magma chamber , and rising as a discrete plume up apical channelways formed by fractures and dikes in the brittle carapace ( Fig . 7 ) .
However , it seems unlikely that this argument can be extended to copper , except perhaps on the margins .
Kesler ( 1973 ) noted a general association ( with exceptions ) of porphyry Cu - Au deposits in island arcs , and porphyry Cu - Mo deposits in continental arcs , and it is clear that the peraluminous felsic rocks associated with rift - related Climax - type porphyry Mo deposits are primarily of continental crustal origin ( Farmer and DePaolo , 1984 ; Stein , 1988 ) .

Second - stage melts from such cumulate sources would therefore be Cu - ( Mo ) - rich , but not necessarily Au - rich .
Details of the model , later updated in Cline ( 1995 ) , show that magmas emplaced at moderate depths ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 kb , equivalent to depths of ~ 4 - 8 km ) most efficiently partition Cu into early saturating saline fluids , whereas Cu and Cl are only released from shallowly emplaced ( 0 . 5 kb , or ~ 2 km ) magmas during late stages of crystallization ( see also Candela , 1989b ) .
The results of these studies indicate that no special conditions or magmatic metal enrichment are required to form even large porphyry Cu deposits .
Assuming that this did indeed happen , then the smaller ( by mass ) vapor component would have to leave the two - phase surface again at pressure before cooling below ~ 400 °C , otherwise its salinity rapidly falls to sub - weight percent levels at lower temperatures and lower pressures ( Figs . 6 and 10 ) , which are inconsistent with fluid inclusion evidence for low to moderately saline liquids in high - sulfidation epithermal ore formation ( Hedenquist et al . , 1994b ; Mancano and Campbell , 1995 ) .

Richards ( 2009 ) proposed that this might explain the occurrence of Au - rich porphyry and related epithermal systems in some post - subduction settings , such as the alkalic - type epithermal Au deposits of the SW Pacific , and various post - collisional Au deposits in the Balkans - Turkey - Iran Neotethyan belt .

Fluids that intersect the V - L solvus above ~ 400° - 500 °C will be moderate - density vapors and will condense a small amount of dense , saline liquid ; fluids that intersect the solvus below this temperature will be liquids and will boil off a dilute , low - density vapor phase .

However , Dietrich et al .

Moreover , Titley ( 1987Titley ( , 2001 has specifically suggested that Au and Ag are crustally derived in a range of ore deposits including porphyries in southwestern USA , because the ratios of these elements correlate closely with two distinct basement domains in this region .

This raises the intriguing possibility that the cylindrical shapes of many porphyry stocks may have arisen first as breccia pipes or diatremes bored out by rapidly escaping volatiles , only later to be back - filled with porphyritic magma ( Fig . 8 ; Norton and Cathles , 1973 ; see also Fig . 2 in Anderson et al . , 2009 , and Fig . 8 in Sillitoe , 2010 , and Fig . 17 in Vry et al . , 2010 .
Indeed , as noted in Section 2 . 1 , there may well be a continuum between silica - rich aqueous fluids and aqueous silicate melts at greater depths in subduction zones ( Kawamoto , 2006 ; Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ; Manning , 2004 ; Portnyagin et al . , 2007 ) .

In contrast , Kepezhinskas et al . ( 2002 ) measured the concentrations of Au and PGEs in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka arc , and suggested that a fluid - transported component could be distinguished from a slab melt component by co - enrichments in PGE and high field strength elements ( HFSE ) in the latter , because of the low capacity of aqueous fluids to carry HFSE .
Moreover , porphyry - type systems are typically not Pb - rich , except in late - stage skarns and distal veins where some of the Pb may have been derived from local host rocks ( e . g . , Mukasa et al . , 1990 ) .

This led Richards ( 2005Richards ( , 2009 to propose that small amounts of sulfide left behind as residual phases from fractionation of arc magmas in the deep lithosphere ( or asthenosphere ) will not significantly deplete those magmas in relatively abundant chalcophile elements such as Cu and Mo , but might significantly deplete them in highly siderophile elements such as Au .

Cloos ( 2001 ) suggested that the classic cupola shape ( Norton , 1982 ) of porphyry systems above larger batholithic magma chambers reflects convective circulation of bubbly magma into the shallow apical parts of these systems ( at 1 - 3 km depth ) , where volatiles physically separate from the melt and coalesce to form a discrete fluidfilled cupola .
In large measure , these differences reflect the change in properties of the magmatichydrothermal fluid , which will separate initially as a moderately saline supercritical fluid in deeper systems ( Fig . 6a , path 1 ) , but as immiscible vapor and brine at shallower levels ( Fig . 6a , path 2 ) .
It is not clear that these assumptions are justified , and some have argued that slab melts might in fact be relatively reducing because of the additional presence of organic - rich sediment melts ( Wang et al . , 2007a ) .

Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) suggested that it is the interaction between this hot , hydrous basalt flux from the subduction zone and felsic crustal partial melts that gives rise to the uniform composition of andesites in continental volcanic arcs , by a process they dubbed melting - assimilation - storage - homogenization ( MASH ) .

In a refinement of this model , Annen et al . ( 2006 ) referred to the region of magma - crust interaction as a " hot zone " ( Fig . 3 ) .
Heinrich et al . ( 2004 ) specifically suggested that brief intersection with the solvus at high pressures and temperatures ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) might be an important way to shed chloride - complexed components such as Fe from the vapor in a brine condensate , leaving bisulfide ligands free to bond with Cu and Au in the residual vapor and transport it to shallower ( epithermal ) levels .

It is the intent of this paper to merge these different geological perspectives on magmagenesis and metallogeny in order to discuss primary metal fluxes in convergent and collisional margins in terms of igneous petrogenetic and magmatic - hydrothermal processes .
Other authors have argued that this process , while it may occur , is not critical to metal behavior in magmatic - hydrothermal systems , and that direct partitioning from the silicate melt to the hydrothermal fluid phase is the dominant mechanism ( e . g . , Audétat and Pettke , 2006 ; Lynton et al . , 1993 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Sun et al . , 2004b ) .
A more detailed analysis of the phase diagram shown in Fig . 6 reveals that a typical magmatic fluid of 2 - 13 wt . % NaCl would have to first intersect the solvus at temperatures above ~ 400° - 500 °C for this model to work optimally , otherwise it would fall on the liquid side of the two - phase field , and would become more saline by boiling off a dilute vapor ( Figs . 9 and 10 ) .
In a landmark paper , Cline and Bodnar ( 1991 ) presented a model for the evolution of magmatic - hydrothermal systems from initial Fig . 7 .
Because of the curvature of the solvus crest ( critical curve ) to lower salinities at low temperatures and pressures , this moderately saline fluid will lie on the liquid side of the solvus at shallow depths , although it may have contracted from what was originally a vapor or supercritical fluid phase at higher temperatures and depths .

Thus far , we have focused on the importance of firstly not losing significant amounts of metal to a fractionating or residual sulfide phase , and then efficiently partitioning those metals into a highly mobile aqueous fluid phase .

Instead , the question is rather one of process efficiency : where ( what depth ) and how are metalliferous fluids released and channeled ?
Thus , the P - T trajectory of a fluid that satisfies Heinrich et al . ' s ( 2004 ) model for high - sulfidation epithermal Cu - Au mineralization ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) is somewhat unique , and may occur only rarely or fleetingly during the waning stages of a cooling magmatic - hydrothermal system .
As noted in Section 2 . 5 . 1 , Richards ( 2009 ) suggested that separation of small amounts of sulfide from arc magmas at depth in lower crustal MASH cumulate zones may provide a source of metals ( especially HSE ) for later post - subduction magmas , but that this process may not substantially affect the Cu content of the original arc magmas .

( 1996 ) have demonstrated a continuum from Cu - Au deposits associated with unevolved , mafic I - type granitoids to W - Mo deposits associated with cogenetic , evolved granites in eastern Australia , suggesting a common , magmatic source for all of these elements .
Therefore , rather than start by trying to identify a unique source for the typical intermediate - to - felsic calc - alkaline magmas that are associated with ore deposits in mature convergent margins , I begin this review by focusing on the much better constrained primitive island arc environment , where the effects of fractionation and crustal contamination , particularly by continentally derived materials , are minimized , and processes in mantle source regions can be more clearly defined .
Such sediments will be water - rich and pelitic in bulk composition , and thus are more likely to undergo partial melting under subduction zone conditions than basaltic oceanic crust ( Hermann and Spandler , 2008 ) .
Evidence from the dike emplacement literature suggests that such fractures may first be opened and propagated by volatile pressure , and only later filled by more viscous magma ( Burnham , 1979 ; Carrigan et al . , 1992 ; Rubin , 1995 ) .
In combination , these four factors , ( 1 ) spatial focusing of fluid flow in narrow cupolas , ( 2 ) reduction of metal solubility , ( 3 ) increased dissolved sulfide activity , and ( 4 ) permeability increase due to transition from ductile to brittle fracturing and retrograde silica solubility ( with a large pressure drop ) , serve to narrowly focus Cu - sulfide mineralization both laterally and vertically within cupola zones above large mid - to upper crustal batholithic complexes .

However , this condensation step must then be followed by cooling while still at depth , in order to " lift " the vapor phase off the two - phase surface , and allow it to contract to a liquid ( Figs . 6b and 9 , path 4 ) .
Nevertheless , Aizawa et al . ( 1999 ) ; Dreyer et al . ( 2010 ) ; and Duggen et al . ( 2007 ) have suggested that dehydration is the principal process affecting sediments down to depths of ~ 100 km ( i . e . , to below the volcanic arc ) , with melting only occurring significantly at greater depths when temperatures exceed ~ 800 °C ( possibly reflected in the geochemistry of some back - arc magmas ) .
At higher pressures ( ~ 6 GPa ) and greater depths ( ~ 175 km ) there may no longer be a physical distinction between solute - rich aqueous liquids and hydrous silicate melts , and the fluid may be supercritical in nature ( e . g . , Kessel et al . , 2005a , b ) , but the role of such deeply released fluids in subduction zone magmatism is unclear ( see discussion in Richards and Kerrich , 2007 ) .
The third factor is the increased permeability over this temperature range caused by a combination of the transition in silicate rocks from ductile to brittle behavior at temperatures ( between ~ 400° - 350 °C ; i . e . , the brittle - ductile transition ; Fig . 7 ; Cathles , 1991 ; Fournier , 1999 ; Landtwing et al . , 2005 ) , and a window of retrograde silica solubility ( between ~ 550 - 350 °C ; Fournier , 1985 ) .
The theory was given credence by the experiments of Rapp et al . ( 1991 ) and Rapp and Watson ( 1995 ) , who showed that melting of amphibolite under upper mantle conditions ( 1025 °C and 0 . 8 - 1 . 6 GPa ) could generate an intermediate composition tonalite - trondhjemite melt , not dissimilar to an arc andesite .

Keith et al . ( 1997 ) , Hattori and Keith ( 2001 ) , and Maughan et al . ( 2002 ) have also suggested that injections of mafic alkaline magmas into the evolving Bingham Canyon magmatic system may have given rise to the unusually large size and high grades of this porphyry Cu - Mo - Au deposit .

Critically , Hamada and Fujii ( 2008 ) and Zimmer et al . ( 2010 ) report that a water content of 2 wt . % separates " dry " tholeiitic ( olivine + plagioclase / orthopyroxene ) from " wet " calc - alkaline ( clinopyroxene + magnetite ) magmatic fractionation trends .
This finding is of fundamental importance from an exploration perspective , because it shifts the focus from seeking anomalously metal - rich magmas ( which have proven elusive ; Jenner et al . , 2010 ) to searching for optimal ore depositional settings in otherwise normal tectonomagmatic environments ( e . g . , Tosdal and Richards , 2001 ) .

Cloos ( 2001 ) , Shinohara et al . ( 1995 ) , and Shinohara and Hedenquist ( 1997 ) considered the question of process efficiency from the perspective of physical separation and focusing of volatile release from the magma .
Combining these models with ( Cline , 1995 ; Cline and Bodnar ' s , 1991 ) calculations suggests that maximum ore - forming efficiency in porphyry systems is likely achieved where volatile saturation occurs in large ( ≥ 100 km 3 ) mid - to upper crustal magma chambers at depths ≥6 km , containing moderately hydrous ( N4 wt . % H 2 O ) and Cl - rich magmas .
A key finding of this work was that , although there are many variables that can affect the specific evolutionary path of a given system , an economic porphyry Cu deposit can potentially be formed from quite small volumes of typical andesitic arc magma .
Hamlyn et al . ( 1985 ) , Richards ( 1995Richards ( , 2009 , Solomon ( 1990 ) , and Wyborn and Sun ( 1994 ) have explored the role of residual sulfide phases on the metal content of fractionating magmas , and also of partial melts formed during later , post - subduction melting events .

In a study of metasomatized mantle xenoliths from a submarine volcano near Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea , McInnes et al . ( 1999 ) concluded that enrichments in Cu , Au , and PGE were caused by slab fluid metasomatism , rather than melts .
Early resistance to these ideas was , I believe , at least in part due to confusions of terminology : most papers dealing with this subject have referred to metal solubility and transport in a vapor phase , suggesting to the unwary a low density , low salinity gas , whereas for the most part the fluids in question were either single - phase supercritical fluids , or relatively high density vapors just below their critical points .

This has led to diverging opinions : for example , Aitcheson et al . ( 1995 ) ; Hildreth and Moorbath ( 1988 ) ; James ( 1982 ) ; Kay et al . ( 1999 ) ; and Tilton et al . ( 1981 ) concluded that the bulk of the radiogenic Pb in central Andean magmas comes from upper plate crustal sources , whereas Macfarlane ( 1999 ) ; McNutt et al . ( 1979 ) ; Mukasa et al . ( 1990 ) ; and Sillitoe and Hart ( 1984 ) preferred a subducted sediment source for Pb in some Andean igneous rocks and ore deposits .
Our current understanding of these partitioning processes is now quite advanced following several decades of hydrothermal experiments ( e . g . , Candela and Piccoli , 1995 ) and more recently the advance of quantitative single fluid and melt inclusion analysis ( e . g . , Heinrich et al . , 2003a , b ) , which has enabled direct measurement of metal contents in ore - forming fluids and melts .
